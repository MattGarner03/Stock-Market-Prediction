James Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2025 earnings call. You saw in the press release this morning, Lockheed Martin Corporation delivered strong all-around performance in the first quarter, continuing the growth momentum we've seen over the last two years. We increased our year-over-year sales 4% in the quarter and generated solid cash and enabled investment of $850 million in independent research and development and capital expenditures. Moreover, we provided a robust shareholder return of $1.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. As Evan will discuss in a moment, these results reinforce our confidence in our full-year guidance of mid-single-digit growth in sales, 11% segment operating margin, and double-digit growth in free cash flow per share. Our strong start in Q1 enables us to mitigate or absorb currently known tariff headwinds, as well as the direct program impacts of the Next Generation Air Dominance program decision. We maintain our original guidance for the full year. With respect to the U.S. Defense budget, we continue to operate under a full year continuing resolution that allows for new awards and the transfer of funds across programs. And we are actively engaged with our customers to provide best-value solutions to them in this process. We're applying this best-value approach also to our customer interactions regarding the 2026 presidential budget request as well. This is especially applicable to the president's high-priority launch of the Golden Dome for America, where we are describing how current Lockheed Martin Corporation programs that are already at scaled production can contribute immediately to the solution. Our Twenty-First Century Security Strategy, where we integrate existing and new satellites, aircraft, ships, missile launchers, and command and control systems with constantly upgradeable digital technologies, was tailor-made for Golden Dome. In addition to the significant opportunities presented by this project, we have recently won several large missile program awards in the first quarter already comprising up to $10 billion in future work. These include substantial contracts for precision strike missiles (PRISM), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and joint air-to-surface standoff missiles and long-range anti-ship missiles. These are among the most sophisticated and effective guided missile systems in the world and are continuously proving themselves in actual combat operations. Lockheed Martin Corporation Space also received a modification to their existing contract for next-generation U.S. Deterrents at sea. The upgraded missile, often referred to as the Fleet Ballistic Missile, is called the Trident II D5 Life Extension. Lockheed Martin Corporation has provided this critical proven deterrence capability for 70 years, and this award launches the technology refresh that will continue this franchise for decades into the future. Beyond missiles, our space team recently won a contract on a classified program in which we will demonstrate highly advanced capabilities and the latest cutting-edge technologies available. We've proven these new capabilities on orbit and are ready to produce these vehicles at scale right now. This is another example of our ability to apply the latest technology at a level of reliability that can quickly improve the ability to deter arm conflict and win it if need be. We also received the contract to integrate a system of next-generation infrared sensors on the F-22 Raptor to enhance the aircraft's survivability and lethality. As a former Air Force pilot, I can provide strong assurance that this new capability will further enable the fifth-generation F-22 to shoot down enemy aircraft before they even know that we're there. Equally notable in the quarter, and another example of developing on the leading edge of evolving requirements, was our demonstration of cost-effective countermeasures against drone warfare. Complementing our existing systems for integrated air and missile defense, by leveraging sophisticated electronic warfare techniques to find and destroy swarms of dump drones. Our team conducted the first in a series of innovative demos featuring a system designed to detect track, identify, and defeat a mix of small drones cost-effectively, driving another value-based solution for our customers. And in another first-of-its-kind real-world demonstration, our Skunk Works team joined with the Royal Netherlands Air Force to showcase the first-ever live classified data share outside the United States between an F-35 in flight and a Dutch command and control system during a multinational military exercise. This is a first and a significant step forward in using digital technology for the integration of ground, air, and naval forces, with the F-35 serving as the quarterback between several allied nations in real-time. Speaking of next-generation technologies, I think it's important to highlight that over the past few years, we've pivoted our long-term strategy to transcend any individual program and provide cost-effective solutions by combining our installed base of highly capable hardware with AI 5G, distributed cloud and the like. For example, the air superiority mission is being done today with a host of aircraft and other systems. Many of which you all know are made by Lockheed Martin Corporation. In a combination needed to defeat even more aggressive and sophisticated adversaries, thereby deterring them from initiating a hostile action. This mission solution orientation that we call Twenty-First Century Security is designed to extend the life and capabilities of our existing platforms like the F-16, F-35, and F-22 in an ever-increasing threat environment in a manner that's affordable to the U.S. and its allies. While integrating new platforms such as NGAD into the mission fabric over time. Lockheed Martin Corporation's broad R&D portfolio exclusively positions us to make this a reality. Our next-generation air dominance efforts advance many classified technologies that were aligned to this strategy. And we plan on applying those technologies to our current systems making our already proven products even more relevant to the future. As well as enhancing the capabilities we provide in ongoing and future development. For example, the knowledge and technology development gained from our investments in the NGAD competition strengthened our conviction, to enhance the F-35 to a fifth-generation-plus capability, and I challenged the team to deliver 80% of sixth-gen capability at 50% of the cost. In support of this vision, we're also committing to drive disruptive innovation and building upon our recently established internal capabilities in AI autonomy, crewed-uncrewed teaming, and command and control systems across the whole company. We have aligned these technology investments with our customer priorities and demonstrated meaningful increases in capabilities at relatively low cost. We've already shown the networking and teaming ability of the F-35 and the F-22 to control uncrewed vehicle systems like drone wingmen through onboard deployments of our autonomy solutions on real aircraft. Our Skunk Works team has also invented a ground and sea-based drone command station powered by our operational autonomy platform which is currently in production today for the Navy. As a central data aggregator, processing, and distribution node in this architecture, the F-35 can execute its air combat quarterback role. The global F-35 fleet today stands at more than 1,100 aircraft, with the total fleet expected to be greater than 3,500. Enabling the U.S. and its allies to maintain command of the skies far into the future. To further our strategic vision, my immediate focus is on operational execution. Driving cost competitiveness, quality, and schedule every day. With $173 billion of backlog, more than two years of sales, we're focused on delivering on time and on budget. We're continuing to execute our 1LMx end-to-end business process transformation which has been underway since 2022. Through this, we've driven increased production of high-demand systems like HIMARS, we accelerated software deployment through our software factory, and enabled model-based engineering with digital twins of many of our products. And going forward, we have a deep bench of talent needed to continue to succeed. An apparent example of that is our new CFO, Evan Scott, joining us today for his first quarterly earnings call and his new role. A 26-year veteran of Lockheed Martin Corporation, Evan knows this business inside and out, and he has a deep appreciation for our customers and their missions. I'm confident that he'll be a great asset to our executive leadership team. And now I'll turn it over to Evan to share more about his background and our financial results.
Evan Scott: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. It's a privilege to be speaking with you all this morning. As Jim mentioned, I've been at Lockheed Martin Corporation my entire career. The depth and breadth of the work we do to help American and allied service members complete their mission successfully and return home safely is truly unmatched. Over the course of my career here, I've had the opportunity to work across a range of functions. Including as treasurer, and the CFO of two business areas, Space and MFC. I've been fortunate to see firsthand how this company operates and evolves to deliver value across every part of the business for both our customers and our shareholders. Even before accepting this role, I worked hand in hand with leaders across the company on our business strategy and priorities, helping to ensure continued financial discipline and execution of our capital allocation strategy. While driving growth and advancing our mission solution focused Twenty-First Century Security Strategy. I have great respect for the path that's been charted and recognize the company's solid foundation for continued growth. My intention is to carry this momentum forward staying true to the strategic vision that has positioned us for long-term success and working closely with Jim, Frank, and the rest of the executive team to deliver on our operational and financial targets. As we continue this journey, you have my commitment to maintaining transparency, consistency, and open dialogue just as we always have. And on that note, let's turn to our performance for the quarter starting with key financial highlights, on Chart four. Our strong financial results in the first quarter positioned us well for the remainder of the year, highlighted by 4% sales growth, and 11.6% segment margins. With all four business areas generating double-digit returns. Boosted by better-than-expected performance on contract completions at Aeronautics, RMS, and Space. GAAP earnings per share of $7.28 increased 14% with benefits from higher volume, higher profit adjustments, and lower share count more than offsetting higher interest expense and lower FASTCAS pension adjustment. Shifting to new business, while our book-to-bill was less than one in the quarter, backlog remains healthy at approximately $173 billion. Our largest awards in Q1 came from MFC and RMS. As Jim noted, within MFC, we recorded approximately $2 billion in orders for the JASM LRASM, large law procurement Yuca, and facilitation contracts, supporting the production ramp to 1,100 units in 2027. At RMS, we booked six years of future work, supporting the implementation phase, of the Canadian Surface Combatant River Class Destroyer program continuing our partnership with Irving Shipbuilding to upgrade the Canadian fleet. Moving to free cash flow, we generated $955 million in the quarter, after investing nearly $850 million into R&D and capital expenditures, in the maturation of innovative technologies, digital transformation, and operational efficiencies. We, with the overarching goal of improving performance and providing the most complete multi-domain solutions for our customers. In addition to investing in next-generation capabilities, we maintained our commitment to shareholders by returning over $1.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases. Now, I'll hand it to Maria to discuss the business area results in more detail.
Maria Ricciardone: Before I transition into the business area details, one reminder, there are no calendarization differences between 2024 and 2025. All four quarters have 13 weeks in both periods. Okay. Starting with Aeronautics on Chart five. First quarter sales at Aero increased 3% year over year, to $7.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes on the F-35, mainly on production contracts. Segment operating profit increased 6% year over year, due to the higher volume, as well as higher profit booking rate adjustments, including the benefit from favorable performance at completion on a classified contract. In February, Singapore signed the Letter of Offer and Acceptance for eight F-35As. This milestone expands Singapore's program of record to 20 jets and demonstrates continued international interest in the F-35 and the advanced capabilities it provides. Turning to missiles and fire control on Chart six. Sales at MFC increased 13% from the prior year, driven by higher volume on multiple tactical and strike missile programs, including JASM LRASM, GMLRS, and HIMARS. Segment operating profit improved 50% year over year, driven by higher volume and higher profit rate adjustments. The higher profit rate adjustments were primarily due to the absence of the $100 million loss on a classified program we recognized in last year's first quarter. Normalizing for the loss, MFC's profit in Q1 2025 improved in line with sales at 13%, with margins up 10 basis points year over year. This quarter, we debuted the Common Multi-Mission Truck family of air vehicles that can be produced rapidly and affordably for domestic and international customers. Known as COMET, this affordable mass missile has an all-digital design and modularity that offers mission flexibility. COMET demonstrates 1LMX at work. It is the result of model-based engineering, which maximizes component reuse and commonality across programs to radically accelerate development. For example, for COMET, we reduced the time required to get to a preliminary design review, a major milestone, by 50%. Shifting to rotary and mission systems on Chart seven. Sales at RMS increased 6% in the quarter, to $4.3 billion, driven by higher volume on the Canadian Surface Combatant and radar programs within the integrated warfare systems and sensors portfolio, and higher volume on Black Hawk at Sikorsky. Operating profit was up 21% year over year, due to the higher volume, as well as higher profit rate adjustments and a favorable contract mix, including a benefit related to an intellectual property licensing arrangement. The picture to the right shows drones used by the Lockheed Martin counter UAS team in the recent field event that Jim mentioned in his remarks. And on Chart eight, we'll wrap up the business area discussion with Space. Space sales decreased 2% year over year, due to lower volume at National Security Space, primarily related to the Overhead Persistent Infrared Radar program (OPIR), partially offset by higher volume at Commercial Civil Space, due to lunar program lifecycle. Despite the lower sales volume, space operating profit increased 17% compared to Q1 2024. This increase was driven by higher profit rate adjustments, primarily due to favorable performance at completion on certain commercial civil space programs. Lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance partially offset this benefit, as ULA had fewer launches year over year, as well as higher initial costs associated with Vulcan profitability. The picture to the right is an LM-400 technology demonstration satellite that recently completed its prelaunch processing and is awaiting the next available launch window at Vandenberg Space Force Base. The technology demonstrator is the latest in a series of self-funded missions to demonstrate the maturity of new technology on orbit and reduce risk for our customers. The LM-400 is capable of serving military, commercial, or civil customers, can be customized to host a variety of missions, and can operate in any orbit. Now I'll turn it back over to Evan.
Evan Scott: Thanks, Maria. Shifting gears, I'll walk through guidance on Chart nine. Our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2025 financial outlook remain unchanged from what we laid out in January, with the strong first quarter results positioning us well to achieve a consolidated full-year outlook of mid-single-digit sales growth, solid 11% margins, and high single-digit free cash flow growth of $6.7 billion at the midpoint. In addition, there is an opportunity to increase backlog in 2025, providing a solid foundation for sustained growth. As I mentioned earlier, the strong profit we realized in the first quarter provides increased confidence in our ability to absorb currently estimated 2025 profit impacts from tariffs and the ENGAT announcement. While it will take more time to complete a thorough business assessment of these dynamics, we're optimistic about achieving our profit targets for the year and look forward to partnering with Frank and the rest of the leadership team on operational excellence initiatives to unlock company-wide efficiencies. Now given the dynamic backdrop, I'd like to note several key assumptions within our guidance. First, on F-35, we continue to expect between 170 to 190 deliveries for the year from the world's premier fighter jet production operation, with a backlog of approximately 360 jets at the end of Q1. And we anticipate definitizing the Lot 18 contract in the second quarter, which we expect will unlock cash currently tied up in working capital on the balance sheet. At the same time, we're making good progress on TR-3 stability and incremental capability releases. Second, the outlook assumes a certain level of tariff impact as we expect to mitigate potential cost increases and offset cash timing pressures. We continue to work closely with our customers on this and will provide updates during the course of the year if we see further impacts on our business despite those efforts. Third, our guide accommodates the direct program impacts of the ENGAT announcement on 2025 quarter sales, profit, and cash flow. As you would expect, we are currently evaluating the broader business implications and will have more to share when we report on our second quarter results. Lastly, we assume our programs are funded in a timely manner to support operational needs and the outlook does not include a pension contribution for this year. Looking beyond our strong 2025 guide, the current backdrop supports sustained backlog strength with improved U.S. and international budget opportunities. This provides a line of sight to stronger sales growth rates through 2027 than previously expected. This steady top-line growth combined with operational improvements are expected to provide a solid foundation for consistent free cash flow generation. That enables our capital deployment priorities over the next three years. Namely to invest over $10 billion in R&D and capital expenditures, and return at least $18 billion to shareholders via dividends and repurchases, all while continuing to fund required pension contributions. In summary, on Chart ten, we're off to a solid start in 2025 and have a strong focus on operational excellence to ensure we deliver on our customer and programmatic requirements while also building momentum towards delivering our full-year guidance. In parallel, we remain committed to investing for the future and creating long-term value for our customers and shareholders. With that, Sarah, let's open up the call for Q and A.
Operator: You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star then one again. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the number. Once again, if you have a question, please press star then one at this time. Your first question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open.
David Strauss: Good morning. Thanks. And, Evan, welcome to the call. Jim, wanted to ask you about the NGAD decision. At this point, have you received a debrief from the Air Force and gotten some feedback there? And how are you thinking about the way forward in terms of potentially protesting the award? Thanks.
James Taiclet: Yeah. Good morning, David. We did get a classified debrief from the U.S. Air Force on it, their NGAD, and we are taking that feedback internally and looking at all the aspects that we were briefed on, which we can't speak to because of the classification level. But we are addressing those. On a strategic basis, where we are going with this decision is not to protest it. We are not going to protest the NGAD decision of the U.S. government. We are moving forward and moving out on applying all the technologies that we develop for our NGAD bid onto our embedded base of F-35 and F-22. I feel that we can have again, 80% of the capability potentially but at 50% of the cost per unit aircraft by taking the F-35 chassis and applying numerous advanced technologies, some of which are already in process and Block Four and F-35, but others that we can apply and we are going to offer fairly rapidly to the Department of Defense. To really take that chassis and supercharge it for the future. And that's kind of a fifth generation plus concept for F-35 and that investment in NGAD technologies that we made over the last few years are gonna be applied directly to that chassis. And like I said, eventually, there'll be 3,500 of those chassis out there. At various stages of technology and capability. We think we can get most of the way to sixth gen at half the cost.
Operator: The next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.
Jason Gursky: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Evan, welcome to the call, my sentiments as well to you. Jim, I was wondering if you could just comment a little and maybe reflect on some of the executive orders that have been coming out of the White House since the new administration came to office back in January. We've seen quite a bit come out, some of it related to FMS and speeding up the process there. But I think as recently as last week, we've got an executive order that points to the potential rewriting of federal acquisition regulation. I'm wondering if you guys have some perspective on what the administration is up to here, what they're trying to accomplish, whether this is just strictly reducing red tape and speeding the process up or if there are going to be some longer-term structural consequences for the industrial base and the way that you interact with the building. Thanks.
James Taiclet: Yeah, Jason. Not only do we welcome these, we applaud these executive orders and have been advocating for them since I joined from the telecom industry, the management of this company about four or five years ago. So we are involved in advocating and making recommendations along all of these lines. One of the biggest piece issues where, you know, there's limitations on the speed at which digital technology and even the most advanced physical technologies can be introduced into the national defense enterprise is the red tape. And so the statutes, regulations, constraints, audits that have evolved through the DOD bureaucracy over decades have never reversed themselves. This is a chance for those to be really scrutinized and reduced. We will be speeding up not only our FMS opportunities around the world by what the administration is pressing for here, but we'll be able to get faster acquisition pass for both physical and digital technology. So I think reducing the bureaucratic red tape that's built up in this industry over the past few decades is going to be a boon to our industry. And when I say our industry, I mean broadly. Right? And that includes the, you know, the traditional, as we are sometimes called, aerospace and defense prime contractors. It includes major technology companies such as Verizon and NVIDIA and Microsoft that are our partners. It includes midsize and new entrants. We want the best of U.S. industry and technology development applied to the national security space. And we want to be part of that. And we applaud all these changes that are coming down through the executive orders. The one thing I want to make sure that we get a chance to do is a chance to compete on every dimension. I used to be captain of the Air Force rugby team, and all I want to do is get my team on the field and get in the game. I don't care if it's a small contract, a big one, if it sounds like a tech approach or a traditional approach, we can compete on every playing field, and we just want to have that level playing field to compete on. So long way of saying, I'm really encouraged and energized by what the administration is doing here.
Operator: The next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kristine Liwag: Hey. Good morning, everyone. And Evan, welcome to the call. So maybe starting off, the tariff situation is fast-moving, but there's a general sense that defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation are more insulated than other industrial companies. And I guess to the extent that they do exist, what are the underappreciated risks of tariffs in your business? And Evan, as a new CFO, what are your priorities as you navigate this environment?
Evan Scott: Sure. Yeah. Good morning. Thanks, Kristine. So from a tariff perspective, I do agree that we have certain protections in our industry, and after reviewing with each of the four BAs, I feel comfortable we've got an approach to mitigate the impacts, and that's what gave us confidence to reaffirm guidance. I'd say in a lot of cases, we're going to have just direct protection in our supply chain, not in all cases, but in many cases, to avoid tariffs altogether. And then for the vast majority of our external contracts, we've got mechanisms to recover impacts. So I think for us, we see it less as a function of recovery, although we certainly have work to do there, but it's probably more about timing. And so specifically, is there going to be a lag between incurring a tariff cost and recovering those costs? So it's going to stay fluid, but we feel like we've got a good path now, and we'll just keep updated as that progresses throughout the year.
Maria Ricciardone: And just as a reminder, Kristine, you know, 40% of our contracts are cost type. And so, you know, what Evan's referring to mainly is the 60% that are fixed price where we have those contractual clauses both FAR-based and specially negotiated that enable that recovery through different equitable adjustments means. I just wanted to make sure I added that as well.
Evan Scott: Thanks. Yeah. And to the question of priorities, yes, thank you for that. So I plan to lean on prior experiences of this company of moving to high-impact roles. And so, number one goal for me typically is just to make sure momentum is maintained. We move too fast to allow for any gaps in priorities. And so always make sure there's no slowdown in any initiatives my predecessor was driving. And so you really shouldn't expect to see any near-term changes particularly with our consistent focus on delivering shareholder value. Right? That's just so baked into our culture and is not in question. So I as Jim said, fortunately, I'm very familiar with our programs and strategies. I've got well-established relationships with the ELC from my career here. So specifically, I look forward to meeting with stakeholders and spending significant time listening to the priorities of the investment community. And in those meetings, I'll certainly be prepared to answer questions, but I'm also going to have several of my own to ask. And so definitely look forward to quickly partnering with ELT and my team, move with urgency, and we'll focus on performance, speed, and value-enhancing growth.
Operator: The next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Gautam Khanna: Yeah. Thanks, and welcome, Evan. Was wondering if you could comment on F-35 Lot 19 timing and also if given there's a lot of international demand for the aircraft, how ready are some foreign customers to take delivery earlier if the U.S. cuts back the buy? I'm just wondering, like, how much of a U.S. cutback could you absorb and still keep the production rate at around 156? Thank you.
Evan Scott: Okay. Right. So thank you. So starting with Lot 19, we are looking at the second half of the year for this. And that's baked into our guidance. 
James Taiclet: And then on the international demand, Gautam, it's really strong. There's been a number of announcements over the past few months on plus ups to program orders from the international customers. You know, and I was over at the Munich Security Conference, the main topic in the private meetings with each of the defense ministers and prime ministers was how fast can I get my aircraft. So I feel that in our aeronautics team feels that if there's some moderation, which we do not expect, by the way, in U.S. F-35 production, that we can make up for that in the international opportunities we have and maintain our 150 plus per year production rate. So we're comfortable that that can be maintained.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport. Your line is open.
Richard Safran: Jim, Maria, good morning. Evan, welcome. Jim, could you talk a bit more about your opening remarks on the Golden Dome? I thought maybe you could discuss funding opportunities, timing, and specifically, maybe address how you think that might affect production ramp at MFC, you know, just generally how that might be impacted. Thanks.
James Taiclet: Yep. So it's forming up into sort of three segments, if you will. The government's going to make these policies and define these clearly and specifically, but the way we're viewing it is there's a ground segment which will be radar sensors, command and control systems for existing defensive systems. Right? Ground-based defensive systems. And some of the programs that I already spoke to earlier today and you're kind of alluding to them as well, you know, we have the NGI contract. All of these are PAC-3, are going to be in higher demand. And so we will be in an excellent position to address those right out of the gate. Alright? So even on that ground segment, there are ways to network these systems and redeploy them from existing generally army bases or naval bases in the CONUS already. These systems are out there. They're operational. They're ready to be deployed to foreign operations, but we could actually — it's up to the government. Again, this is policy and not our purview, but we can be supportive in actually fielding those systems, you know, from existing bases to population centers or other high-value areas where we want to really defend the homeland, so to speak. And then we can network, and we've shown this, for example, PAC-3 and THAAD systems and radars. And that's just one example of this interconnectivity that we can create with existing platforms using new digital technology. And that's why 5G and AI distributed cloud are so important because we will have to create a web of defenses — a web of layered defenses even in this ground segment to start really being effective in Golden Dome. And we can literally do that, you know, once the starting gun goes off. The second phase of it will be space-based. And that's another place where, by the way, Lockheed Martin Corporation has a lot of existing assets. We're going to want to help do is network those existing space-based assets down to those more tactical systems on the ground. So that we have early warning, we've got target tracking on launch in mid-course from space so that we can have more accurate fire control over those missile systems in the United States. So that the space layer will be complex. Eventually, there may be kinetic or non-kinetic action from space. That's going to take a little more time to scale. But that's the second arena. And then thirdly, another place where this sort of Twenty-First Century Security Strategy will really intersect the third dimension here is an overarching command and control system, an open architecture standards-based where we can have, whether it's, you know, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin Corporation, other systems, new entrants, will be tied into this fabric and really complete the Golden Dome, so to speak, by doing that. That's that may be a little bit further out. But we can do these tactical ground-based system deployments very quickly, and we can seal production. We've already got investments to do that. So I think we're in excellent shape for Golden Dome. As I suggested in the prepared remarks, our strategy was built for something like Golden Dome, and we're out in front of it with our customers. Budgeting, timing, congressional, you know, funding, all those kinds of things are government policies that will be implemented on their side. But we are literally ready to go when the starting gun goes off.
Evan Scott: And if I could just add a lot given I've got a lot of passion on Golden Dome. I haven't worked at MFC, and as Jim said, we just really felt prepared for this. And it was an early sign our customer tends to move rapidly and with purpose. So just a little bit of stage where it is kind of from the proposal side. The customer issued a RFI, request for information, seeking ideas from industry that would inform possible RFPs. And so what was remarkable about this one from my perspective? The RFI had a 30-day turn, which is super fast for something this significant and complicated. And Lockheed provided, as Jim said, just a series of capabilities, really over 100 different capabilities through pricing that cross all four BAs with a focus on cross-domain architecture. So clearly not all those RFI responses will turn to requirements. We've given our customers a significant amount of go-fast ready capability to consider, and we look forward to partnering with customers and suppliers on next steps, as Jim said, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic. Your line is open.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, guys.
Evan Scott: Good morning.
Pete Skibitski: Jim, one aspect of the new tariff regime, if we go back to that, is not necessarily the cost aspect, but understand China is putting new export controls on rare earth metals. And I don't know necessarily the inventory levels that the U.S. or Lockheed Martin Corporation typically has of these commodities, but I know it's been a topic in DC in terms of the reliance there for a number of years. So I was just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on just the availability impact that the new tariff regime could have? Because I do understand the rare earth are used across a wide variety of defense products. So I was interested in your thoughts. Thanks.
James Taiclet: Yeah. First of all, by law, we're constrained from using Chinese inputs of any kind from any source into our products and services. And so is our supply chain. So there are alternate sources for our segment of the aerospace industry, I'll call it, which is the defense U.S. defense segment. And secondly, there are stockpiles that are available and will be utilized. This is, I think, a larger issue for nondefense industries that require these kinds of materials. Because, you know, our supply chain contracts again, have specified non-Chinese sources for the materials over the decades. So I think we're in pretty good shape on that. And I would, you know, again, applaud the U.S. government in seeking to continue to develop U.S. sources for these raw materials all the way through semiconductors, etc., that we've been, you know, again, advocating for about four or five years, which is our anti-fragility aspect of our strategy, which is we need U.S. sources for even basic materials like titanium, for example, certainly non-adversary sources. And we've been pushing for that with the U.S. government and doing it internally for four or five years based on that sort of anti-fragility concept that seemed to let. So we're I think we're well positioned here. To work through these rare earth and other material issues.
Maria Ricciardone: And Pete, I would just add to that in terms of our guidance for the year. We're pretty confident that a disruption in the material supply for rare earth would not impact our ability to meet our current delivery commitments for the remainder of this calendar year. We have sufficient quantity that's already integrated into our value chain, so it provides a bit of a buffer from potential supply chain disruptions in the near term, and we'll obviously continue to assess as we go on.
Operator: The next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Douglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you. On missiles and fire control, you've had some big increases in backlog. You've got nearly a $2 billion increase this quarter. And so can you talk about some of the production increase plans you have in your major programs? And then is this a business that we could foresee having an extended high single-digit growth rate over the next few years, given that backlog?
Evan Scott: Sure thing. Thanks, Doug. Yeah. So you're right. We've definitely seen strong budget demands here of both domestic and international for the MFC products. And so several of the products are ramping currently. And we talked about earlier the JASM, LRASM ORD, that gives us a path to ramp to 1,100 by 2027. PAC-3 continues to ramp. GMLRS, so we're seeing good demand and very strong backlog. And so some of these products will continue to ramp, and to Jim's point about Golden Dome, I mean, these are always also areas for opportunity on the INF side to be a major part of the Golden Dome architecture. So that could very likely be a source of demand as well. But the reality is with these products, we have a lot of confidence they'll just continue to be in demand all the way across. So can certainly talk more specifics on individual product lines, but I think across those are where we're going to see the real growth with JASM, LRASM, PAC-3, and GMLRS ramping.
James Taiclet: Yeah. And Doug, it's Jim. So just to complement what Evan's saying here. So we map out until the end of the decade our high growth product lines, and you heard us talk about some of them. But adding in there, you know, in addition to GMLRS, PRISM, which is again, got the $5 billion IDIQ order just awarded. Is in that category. Fleet ballistic missile, actually. So, you know, it's sort of a quiet program, but we think it could be double-digit growth CAGR over the course of the rest of this decade, etc. And as he said, JASM, LRASM is in that category of high single-digit growth over a fairly long period of time to get your specific question. So there's a number of others, NGI is in there too. So you know, the missile systems that the company has developed over again, you know, 70 years when it comes to FBM, that is hard to duplicate. These are the best systems in the world. Again, when you go to Munich or Singapore or someplace like that, our customers just readily admit that around the world is it this company has some of the best systems in the world. It's got the best and most sophisticated fighter aircraft in production in the world and will for at least the next five years or so. And does it at scale? And it's the only way we can kind of compete. We, meaning the royal we of our allies and us, with China who's building, you know, 100 plus J-20s a year and now J-30s on top of that. So, you know, our international customers recognize the capabilities of the company, as do our U.S. customers. And again, we're very well positioned for the future here, especially in that missile segment where this stuff is really hard to do, takes decades of experience, is on the edge of known science, and it's not easy to duplicate and just kind of show up at the party and try to compete here. So we're in really good shape in those missile programs.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Scott Deuschle: Hey. Good morning. Jim, you spoke earlier about enhancing the F-35 with technologies you developed for NGAD. Can you clarify, number one, if that effort would be self-funded or customer-funded? And then number two, can you walk through what's driving your confidence in integrating those technologies into F-35? Particularly given some of the recent challenges with technology insertion. Thank you.
James Taiclet: Sure, Scott. So, look, this is a baseline. We have 70,000 engineers and scientists in the company working on really interesting stuff all the time. And some of the sixth-gen plus solution set is already being funded by the U.S. government and the F-35 program itself. There are components, some of which are classified, so I can't really specify them. But, you know, key techniques, I'll say, and approaches that fighter pilots need to have to be competitive and win. I'll just kind of talk to those in general, and you can be assured that we are investing and the government is investing together in these things. Some of these elements are again through the F-35 program as it stands today. Some of it was our government-funded investment in R&D for NGAD. Right? Just a competitive process. Was funded for both Lockheed Martin Corporation and Boeing over a period of years by the government. And we made independent investments along the way too in both of those programs. So there's not a clean percentage, but there's co-investment between the U.S. government, our allies, and Lockheed Martin Corporation in the technologies I'm speaking to. And having had done this myself when I was younger, these things are really important. So one is sensing the enemy at a distance greater than they can sense you. And so those kinds of categories are radar, passive infrared, and passive infrared is really important. Because if I'm transmitting radar, that means somebody else's electronic warfare receiver can see me. And then they can maybe shoot me. So the better I have infrared, which passive we can sense that, and the best radar on top of that. Those kinds of sensors are really, really critical because I explained this to me at the White House. The president's like, dogfights are not what we want anymore in air-to-air combat. We want to shoot the other guys, as I said, before he even knows we're there. So you do that, first of all, with the critical sensors to find them. Then you make sure they can't find you. And that's the stealth technology, and there's some techniques that you know, we've used for our NGAD offering. That can be applied, whether they're materials, geometries, countermeasures for stealth, so no, I can't be seen. That's the first part of the equation. The second part of the equation is you want to have a tracking system and a weapon that can go farther and hit the enemy's plane before they can ever even reach you with their weapon. Right? And so there are techniques and capabilities we delivered with our NGAD bid that were developed for that, and that we can now apply here to the F-35. So we're basically gonna take the chassis and turn it into a Ferrari. Right? It's like a NASCAR upgrade, so to speak. Where we can take the F-35, apply some of those co-funded technologies both from NGAD and the F-35 program, and you're gonna have my challenge to my aeronautics team is let's get 80% of sixth-gen capability at half the price. And that's something that these are engineers, you know, they wouldn't have agreed to this if they didn't think there was a path to get there. That's something we're gonna go out and do. And this is this best-value approach that we've been working our way towards that at Lockheed Martin Corporation over the last four or five years. How do we get the best value to the customer who has a limited budget and an increasing threat? We use these digital technologies. We apply something from one system or one BA to another. And we actually try to create that best value equation. It's a little kind of not uncomfortable, but new novel for our industry to think that way. But we are thinking that way. And value is important And maybe as or more important than the highest technology available. It's gotta be scalable. It's gotta be affordable. It's gotta work every time, and so that's what we're after.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli: Hey, morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, maybe just one point of clarification. It sounds like with the NGAD loss you reassured your multi-year growth, and it seemingly got stronger from a lot of the missile commentary. I just didn't know if that also, you know, took into account maybe weaker domestic F-35 volumes going forward. And then just on your prior comments, I mean, it sounds like you're gonna compete for NGAD dollars directly. You know, converting this chassis to a Ferrari. And any additional color on potential exportability of this technology? I mean, could it be sold to international customers, and has there been any direct discussions about funding or timing from the Air Force?
James Taiclet: That'll be an element-by-element exportability decision by the U.S. government. But what we try to do is build exportability into each of these components. And so we will offer, you know, of course, the U.S. government gets first view of these things. They'll get to adjudicate whether it's exportable and to whom. But our goal is to make as much of this capability, this value capability that we can for fifth gen to have our allies get access to it too. But that's the U.S. government decision, but we try to design in a way that it's a relatively hopefully, an easier decision for exportability rather than a harder one.
Maria Ricciardone: And on the long-term growth, yeah, I do think we see a path to, you know, a little bit better than we laid out prior, at least at the lower end of the low single-digit growth. And, you know, that's fueled by a few things. As you point out, the strong missile orders in Q1, there's also pressure to increase international budgets around the world. And then I'd also say seeing another quarter at 4% sales growth shows that the supply chain does continue to perform. And as we've talked about, it hasn't really been a question of demand. It's been more a question of being able to execute on the supply side. And we are seeing that continue as well. So even with the NGAD loss, that was probably more impactful farther out in the future. And over the next few years, more than offset by some of these other opportunities that we're seeing now.
James Taiclet: Yep. And for example, like the F-35 sustainment contributing to these long-term growth trajectories, the aircraft numbers are gonna go from 1,100, you know, to we expect over time, 3,500. So that growth rate of sustainment on F-35 and this modernization will continue on a much larger number of airplanes as time goes on. So that's a big driver. CH-53K helicopter is really getting to, you know, towards full-rate production. The fleet ballistic missile program, as I said, that's a very important and a very large piece of our long-term growth rate and NGI, etc., in Golden Dome. So there are multiple long-term growth opportunities from through all of our business areas. You know, we're pivoting, by the way, in space. We'll continue to do the big geosynchronous orbit, highly sophisticated satellite units. But this LM-400 is mid-orbit. Plane. And it's more capable than a small sat. But not as expensive as a geosynchronous orbit satellite. And there's more proliferation of them, not 3,000, but maybe there's 300. So you get a lot of the benefits of both in the mid-course, the mid-orbit, if you will. And it's a good compromise for certain missions because you've got a bigger bus with more capability and more life. A small sat may last three to five years, but a mid-orbit satellite like the LM-400 could last call it ten or and then the geosynchronous can be much longer than that. So we're trying to make sure that there's a best-value solution for the mission for our customer at every level of, yeah, the orbits in space or the level of sophistication and cost of the airplane versus the mission. Again, can we get 80% of the value for 50% of the cost? That's a new way for our industry maybe to think about from, you know, 20 or 30 years ago. But that's how we're thinking about it. So we have some really solid long-term growth trajectories. We think we can strengthen the embedded base, make that embedded base live longer and that sustain a trail go farther, whether it's Blackhawk, F-35, F-22, F-16 is now again popular. Why? Because we could put fifth-generation electronics on a fourth-generation chassis. And that's why it's popular. It's more affordable and you get a lot of fifth-gen capability on an F-16 now. And that's why these franchises are not finite necessarily. FBM, 70 years. I mean, these chassis are so hard to make. They're so sophisticated. It's hard to replicate the hardware. But you can make it a lot better with software and with hardware upgrades as you go.
Maria Ricciardone: Great. Well, Sarah, I think we're coming to the top of the hour here. Why don't I turn it back over to Jim for the closing remarks?
James Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. So look, in closing, based on our substantial backlog and this best-value strategy we've been talking about today, this company is really well-positioned in a very dynamic environment. We can all admit that we're in a dynamic environment. But we're continuing to innovate and deliver these advanced and reliable technologies and executing against that long-term strategy while we do the hardware and upgrade it. We really are trying to get out in front of how do we use digital technology like AI to make our platforms work together in a way that provides a high-value relatively low-cost mission capability. And having so many of these great legacy platforms and the ones that will build for the future puts us in a really good position for this. So that ends the call today. Thank you for joining us. Look forward to seeing you all virtually again in July. On our second-quarter earnings call. So thanks everybody. Sarah, we're all concluded for the day.
Operator: Great. Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Maria Ricciardone: Thank you, Sarah, and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings conference call.

James Taiclet: Thanks Maria Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. As you saw in the press release this morning, our return to growth strategy that we implemented three years ago is well on its way and remains on a strong trajectory. In 2024, sales grew 5% year-over-year and our backlog of $176 billion reached yet another record, demonstrating the enduring global demand for our superior scalable and reliable products and systems. Each and every one of our four business areas saw backlog growth and ended the year with a book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1. We fully expect these positive trends to continue in our 2025 outlook with mid-single digit growth in sales segment, operating profit returning to 11% and double-digit growth in free cash flow per share. Jay and Maria will cover the financials in more detail, but I'd like to briefly comment on the earnings impact in the fourth quarter of two classified programs at MFC and Aeronautics respectively. Recording charges in Q4 on these two programs enabled us to de risk the financial profile of both these critical national security programs going forward as we move into their next phases. While these particular contracts were struck a number of years ago, there are no longer any must win competitions. Under today's Lockheed Martin wide bid process, every proposal adheres to a stringent risk adjusted ROI regime. This process is designed to compete aggressively for key opportunities while also being very committed to achieving positive results both in the short and long-term for our shareholders. At the same time, we are committed to ongoing investment in the business to further enhance our company's growth trajectory. Having successfully executed our Return to Growth initiative over the past few years. In 2024 we invested $3.3 billion in research and development and capital to support advanced scalable technology solutions for our customers. Equally important looking forward are investments to enhance the attractiveness and performance of our key programs and initiatives such as America's preeminent 5th generation fighter, the F-35 and our internal digital transformation 1 LMX are expected to grow. Our financial focus remains on free cash flow and free cash flow per share. Our company continued to deploy significant free cash flow in 2024 and we've returned greater than 100% of that free cash flow to you, the shareholders. In addition to our consistent and healthy dividend, we maintain a robust share repurchase program with $3.7 billion of shares repurchased in 2024. Turning to the F-35, we delivered 62 aircraft in the quarter, bringing our total deliveries for 2024 to 110, the high end of our expected range. These deliveries included aircraft that were previously parked and new jets that rolled off the production line. We continue to expect deliveries will exceed the production rate over the next few years and estimate 170 to 190 F-35 aircraft deliveries in 2025. TR-3 capabilities continue to progress in flight testing. We completed qualification testing on a set of key TR-3 capabilities in 2024 and we're making solid progress on system performance and remaining TR-3 deliverables. We expect to release additional capability this year with further upgrades to follow. In addition, the undefinitized contract for Lot 18 F-35 production was awarded in December, bringing our backlog to 408 aircraft. We expect this contract will be definitized during the first half of 2025. We welcomed our 20th global customer, Romania, into the F-35 enterprise in November with its letter of offer and acceptance to procure 32 aircraft. The Romanian Air Force's F-35s will integrate with their existing F-16 fleets as well as other allied F-35s, highlighting the importance of the superior capabilities of this aircraft. Moreover, the F-35's seamless interoperability using our 5G.MIL architecture will be crucial in establishing and maintaining command of the air, especially in the Indo Pacific, European and Middle Eastern theaters. Lockheed Martin's System of Integration expertise across land, air, sea, space, and cyber are essential to continually improving many important national security missions such as protection from air and missile attacks. In this example, our Defensive Guam Flight experimentation mission in December successfully demonstrated the integration of multiple Lockheed Martin and other OEM products into a single combined weapon system. Our Aegis Guam system was successful in acquiring and tracking targets using our TPY-6 radar, planning and conducting the missile engagement using our Aegis Combat system. Then we fired the interceptor from one of our vertical launching systems and ultimately destroyed the incoming weapon. Equally important was the accelerated pace from contact award to successful completion of this flight test mission in under two years and was a direct result of leveraging prior investments in all these proven technologies. Building on our production ready Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, America's hypersonics technology made another important milestone in the development of one of our most important in advanced weapon systems in December. The U.S. army and U.S. navy completed a successful end to end flight test of the common Hypersonic all up round the first live fire event for the long range Hypersonic weapons system. I'd like to shift gears now to current discourse about the defense industry landscape. Much has been said about defense primes, emerging startups, traditional and non-traditional companies. I see us all working together and I think that it's industry's role to help marshal the talent and expertise in our country to provide the best possible deterrent capabilities with both physical products such as ships, aircraft and satellites, as well as digital advanced technologies. We need to access the best talent, financial resources and technologies from both the aerospace and defense and commercial sectors to get ahead and stay ahead. To that end on the commercial front, I've long been an advocate of deepening partnerships across industries. And we have done so with companies such as Nvidia for Artificial Intelligence, Meta and IBM for large language models to more efficiently generate code, analyze data and enhance business processes Verizon for 5G networks, Microsoft for classified cloud modeling and simulation, and Intel and Global Foundries for advanced military hardened chips. We're also investing heavily on internal development, autonomy, AI and other enabling digital technologies to provide the best solutions for our customers. Skunk Works continues to drive the cutting edge, theater level security solutions. In real time, Live Flight demonstrations we had an F-35 flying from our facility in Fort Worth, Texas, sharing classified data via a Skunk Works open system gateway, through a commercial satellite communications and all the way over into a Royal Air Force lab in Farnborough, U.K. where it was integrated into their command and control system. This achievement marks a significant step toward a future integrated defense enhancing our F-35 interoperability in real time with an allied C-2 system using our 5G MIL architecture. In another first, our Lockheed Martin Skunk Works team, along with the U.S. navy and General Atomics, completed a live controlled flight demonstration of an uncrewed system, by the unmanned Carrier Aviation Mission Control Station, which was powered by our autonomy platform. This demonstration is a pathfinder that helps advance the complex technology necessary to enable human machine teaming as envisioned for autonomous systems. We're doing it right now. Turning to the budget, the current continuing resolution funds U.S. government operations through March. We look forward to working with the returning administration to continue pursuing a more agile and streamlined acquisition process that encourages speed, technology innovation and broader participation. We see DOGE as an opportunity to make great progress in all these areas and we will continue to share ideas and do our part to support efforts to eliminate unnecessary regulatory hurdles while working to increase efficiency in our own internal operations through our 1LMX digital transformation. Now I'll turn it over to Jay.
Jay Malave: Thanks Jim, and good morning everyone. Today I'll provide an overview of our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, then hand off to Maria who will cover business area financials and I'll come back at the end to discuss our initial 2025 outlook. 2024 was a solid year. Our growth strategies are paying off with 5% top line growth while also growing backlog 10% to $176 billion. Another year end record. Our balanced portfolio enabled us to generate solid free cash flow and meet our deployment commitments exceeding 100%. Finally, we took prudent de risking actions on key programs that paved the way for a solid outlook in 2025 and beyond. Before I get into the results in more detail, I'll walk you through these de risking actions. Chart 4 provides two different reconciliations that detail the full impact of these items on our full year results and their partial impact to our prior expectations. We've also included a fourth quarter version of the same chart in the Appendix in Slide 20. For purposes of understanding the total impact on our full year results, I'll direct your attention to the middle section of the chart. We recorded net charges of $1.8 billion as follows. $1.4 billion related to the remaining expected future losses on the MFC classified program and $555 million associated with the Aeronautics classified program. With these amounts partially offset by $155 million benefit associated with our C-5 claim resolution. Moving over to the right side of the chart, you may recall that our last outlook in October had assumed some of these net charges, so let me walk you through that as well. Relative to our prior outlook, we recorded $1.4 billion of unplanned net charges consisting of $410 million for the Aeronautics Classified Program, $1.1 billion from the MFC classified program, with these amounts partially offset by $70 million of unplanned benefit from the C-5 claim resolution. Both reconciliations provide adjusted results that exclude the impact of these items for comparison purposes. For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I will refer to the reported and adjusted amounts as shown on the left side of the chart unless otherwise noted. Okay, Moving to Chart 5 with fourth quarter results, sales of $18.6 billion were down slightly year-over-year. Sales in the quarter were unfavorably impacted by having one fewer a week in Q4 2024 compared to Q4 of 2023 partially offset by the F-35 lot 18 deferred revenue carryover from the third quarter. Segment operating profit, segment margins and earnings per share were all adversely impacted by the classified program charges at Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control. On an adjusted basis, segment operating profit would have grown 5% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, resulting in segment margins of 11.1%. Shifting to new business, we recorded over $29 billion of orders in the fourth quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.6. Aeronautics led the way with almost $20 billion in orders driven by the F-35 Lot 18 and fiscal year 2025 air vehicle sustainment contract awards. Both contracts will help secure the wide reaching F-35 U.S. production enterprise and ensure America's military is equipped with the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world. Free cash flow was $440 million in the quarter, including $990 million of pension pre funding to extinguish the 2025 required contributions. Continuing with capital deployment, we further advanced strategic and technical and operational capabilities by investing over $1.1 billion in the quarter towards independent research and development and capital expenditure projects, bringing full year internal investment to $3.3 billion. We continue to provide an unmatched combination of new technology advancement that can be also fielded with speed, so investing to deliver critical capabilities while maintaining our commitment to shareholders by returning $1.8 billion of free cash flow via share repurchases and dividends. Turning to Chart 6 and our full year 2024 results, sales of $71 billion grew 5% driven by improved backlog conversion reflecting stronger throughput across the entire value chain. Similar to the fourth quarter segment operating profit, segment margins and earnings per share were impacted by the net program charges on Slide 4. On an adjusted basis, segment operating profit grew 7% year-over-year and adjusted segment margins were 11.1%. Book-to-bill for the year was greater than 1. In the third consecutive year we've increased backlog. We generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow including the pension pre funding. And finally, our consistent capital deployment continued in 2024 as we returned $6.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Now I'll turn it over to Maria to discuss business area results.
Maria Ricciardone: Thanks Jay. Today I'll discuss fourth quarter and full year results for the business areas. As Jay mentioned, you'll notice that we've included both reported GAAP and adjusted results for each business area in order to provide meaningful comparisons and a more realistic expectation of recurring operational performance. Starting with aeronautics on Chart 7, fourth quarter sales at Aero increased 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher F-35 volume on production and sustainment contracts due to contract awards in the quarter, including the awards for the Lot 18 undefinitized contract action and Air vehicle sustainment contract. Partially offsetting this was lower volume at Skunk Works, driven by the unfavorable sales impact associated with the classified program charge. Adjusting for the impacts of the classified program charge and the C-5 contract resolution, the adjusted sales growth at Aero was approximately 7% year-over-year in Q4 2020. Both reported and adjusted sales in the fourth quarter benefited from $700 million of F-35 sales deferred from the third quarter. Segment operating profit decreased 43% compared to Q4 2023. Lower profit booking rate adjustments due to the $410 million classified program charge in the quarter were partially offset by higher sales volume and the benefit related to the C-5 claim resolution. On an adjusted basis, operating profit year-over-year in the quarter increased slightly. For the full year, sales increased 4% driven by higher volume across the F-35 program and the production ramp on the F-16 program partially offset by lower volume at Skunk Works due to the sales impact related to the classified program charge. Full year segment operating profit decreased 11% driven by the same items we saw in the fourth quarter. Lower profit rate adjustments partially offset by sales volume and the C-5 claim resolution benefit. On an adjusted basis Aeronautics full year operating profit grew by 3% equating to 10.2% margin for the year. Turning to Missiles and Fire control on Chart 8. MFC sales increased 8% year-over-year driven by production ramps on Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile, JASSM, Long Range Anti-Ship Missile LRASM, Guided Multiple Launch rocket system, GMLRS and PAC-3. Normalizing for the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2023, MFC sales grew 16% year-over-year. Segment operating profit decreased significantly year-over-year in the quarter due to lower profit booking rate adjustments driven by the recognition of reach forward losses on the classified program. Adjusting for that item, segment margins were a strong 14.8% in the quarter. For the full year, MFC sales increased double digits, up 13% again due to production ramps on GMLRS, LRASM, JASSM and PAC-3 programs. Full year segment operating profit declined $1.1 billion year-over-year due to $1.4 billion of classified program charges which were partially offset by higher volume from the production ramps. Excluding the classified program charges, MFC's segment operating margin for the full year was a solid 14.4%. Shifting to Rotary & Mission Systems on Chart 9, sales decreased 10% in the quarter to approximately $4.3 billion primarily driven by lower volume on Seahawk, CRH, AEGIS and various C6ISR programs. Normalizing for the week difference in Q4 2023, RMS sales were down 3% year-over-year in the quarter. Similar to sales, operating profit was down 11% year-over-year due to lower profit booking rate adjustments and sales volume partially offset by favorable contract mix. For the full year, sales increased 6% at RMS primarily driven by higher volume on the Canadian Surface Combatant and laser programs within the integrated Warfare systems and sensors business, as well as various C6ISR programs and the CH-53K ramp at Sikorsky. Operating profit was up 3% for the year due to the higher sales volume and favorable contract mix, partially offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. Finally, with space on Chart 10, sales decreased 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. The reduction was driven by lower volume on NextGen OPIR Orion and Classified primarily due to program life cycles. Normalized for the number of weeks in the quarter year-over-year, sales were down 6%. Operating profit decreased 8% compared to Q4 2023, driven by lower volume and lower profit booking rate adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings from the United Launch Alliance. Turning to the full year, sales decreased slightly driven by lower volume on the same programs as in the fourth quarter, partially offset by higher volume on the fleet ballistic missile and reentry program. Meanwhile, operating profit increased 6% in 2024 due to favorable contract mix and higher ULA equity earnings, partially offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. I'd like to note the photo on page 10. In December, Lockheed Martin supported the successful launch of the GPS-3 space vehicle 7, which we designed and built. This accelerated launch required complex integration and was the first to demonstrate operational agility for critical national security missions. With that, I will turn it back over to Jay to wrap up our prepared remarks.
Jay Malave: All right, thanks, Maria. Turning to Chart 11 and our forward expectations, our outlook for 2025 has improved since October along with our rising value chain performance expectations. In addition to the benefit from the de risking actions we took in 2024, we anticipate sales growth of 4% to 5% on top of the 5% we delivered in 2024. We expect MFC to again lead the way with 8% growth at the midpoint as we continue to ramp production across several programs to support the strong demand for our combat, proven munitions and integrated air and missile defense systems. As previously discussed, operating margins returned to 11% and free cash flow grows 9% at the midpoint from 2024 to adjusted results, setting up double digit growth in free cash flow per share in spite of non-cash FAS pension headwind lowering EPS. I'll step through segment operating profit and EPS bridges in more detail in the following charts. Chart 12 bridges the 2024 reported segment operating profit of 6.1 billion to the 2025 guidance midpoint of 8.15 billion. After accounting for the 2024 net charges, we expect operating profit growth from the adjusted 2024 position. The growth is primarily due to the volume drop through and partially offset by other items, mainly lower expected net profit rate adjustments. Importantly, segment margins are expected to return to 11% in 2025 earlier than planned. Next on chart 13 we have a similar walk for earnings per share. Here we expect EPS to decline slightly from the 2024 adjusted position mainly due to non-operational items, notably the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as well as higher interest expense. Bringing it all together, we expect solid sales growth in 2025 off the higher 2024 base operating margins at the 11% target and solid cash flow generation that enables consistent shareholder returns. So in summary on Chart 14, in 2024 we delivered stronger top line growth than initially expected, reflecting an improving operating cadence. We also expanded our backlog to a new record demonstrating the strength of our unmatched capability to deliver security solutions at speed while increasing investment to expand this capability and we prudently de risked programs, all the while dependably generating free cash flow and deploying it as committed. Taken together, these actions give us confidence to deliver a strong financial outlook for 2025. At the same time, we will continue to propel this industry forward with innovative solutions that integrate the best that commercial and military industries can offer and of course, we remain focused on operational execution to deliver on our commitments and create long term value for our customers and shareholders. With that, Sarah, let's open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman. My apologies from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Seth Seifman: No worries. Thanks very much and good morning everyone.
James Taiclet: Morning, Seth.
Seth Seifman: I wanted to ask Jay emphasize kind of the de risking nature of the charges in Q4. I know maybe it's difficult to discuss because it's classified, but within aeronautics, all of the filing language has sort of emphasized continued risk there. Should we think that within following this charge, the potential for future charges there has really come down considerably and is there anything you can say about where we might be in the lifecycle of that program and when it might be able to provide some positive returns and then thinking maybe that the answer there might have to be a little bit circumspect. If you could just comment on the multi-year targets that you gave on the last call and how to think about those now.
Jay Malave: Okay, thanks Seth. There's about 16 questions in that one question, but I'll take a shot at all of them. Just as far as the risk, I would say we significantly reduced the risk. I can't really get into the life cycle of the program given the classified nature of it, but let me walk you through why I believe that we've significantly reduced the risk. We had realized this risk earlier in the year, causing us to perform a more comprehensive review of current performance versus our key assumptions included in the estimate to complete. We evaluated the risk and opportunities and made the determination that a cost reset was warranted. The amount route that we recorded in the quarter is the most conservative assessment we've made to date. We've also made a number of process changes. Aeronautics, along with our corporate staff, have implemented a more continuous monitoring process of the progress of this program in terms of technical milestones and added technical resources from the outside the program. This will enable both teams to work together to institute support measures as needed faster than before. We've also added technical resources and experts with experience in the risk areas to help bolster the team and mitigate risk as they arise. We've added automated testing procedures as well to accelerate test results and issue resolution should they occur. So all those things taken together give us confidence that we have significantly derisked this program and significantly reduce the risk of future charges on this. As far as maybe the multiyear outlook, you look at 2025 and certainly the 2025 outlook is better than what we had projected in October. If you recall, we had said our baseline was low single digit with an opportunity to get to a mid-single digit. Here we believe the opportunity was realized for 2025 which gave us confidence to increase our growth outlook to 4% to 5%. And that's the same type of process that we'll continue to look at in 2016 and beyond. And again, it's based on our ability to really drive throughput through the entire value chain. As I mentioned before in my prepared remarks that we continue to have rising expectations there and rising confidence that not only our supply chain but our internal operations can move at a quicker pace, enabling the unlocking of this revenue growth. So our confidence is growing there.
Operator: The next question comes from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Rob Stallard: Thanks very much. Good morning.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
Rob Stallard: Question for Jim. At the same time as you're taking these charges on these classified programs, it looks like the new administration and the Department of Defence is actually getting more pro fixed price contracts in commercial terms. Are you worried that the defence industry could be taking on more risk and opening itself up for more charges in the future?
James Taiclet: Not necessarily, Rob, because we're going to apply this disciplined bid process to fixed price and cost plus contracts. And if the proportion is moving potentially towards fixed price, we're going to use the same discipline. And there's a trend in this industry to be much more deliberate about how each company bids. Each company has its own strategy. Ours is something I brought over from my last business experience, which is risk adjusted return on investment is the key criteria. And be honest about the risks up front and price them in. And if that price doesn't meet the competition, so be it. We'll move on to other things. So I'm not concerned about that. As I said, I look at DOGE as an opportunity because as far back as 2021, I've been advocating for systemic change in the way that the defense enterprise operates. And that's meaning Congress, executive branch, Pentagon, aerospace and defense industry, commercial tech startups. We need to expand our ability as a country to get everybody involved. And I welcome DOGE's effort and the administration's effort to reduce the bureaucracy, limit the administrative burdens that the Pentagon now puts on all companies, big and small, that want to work with it. So again, I look at all this as an opportunity and if it moves a bit more towards fixed price proportions, so be it.
Jay Malave: Rob, the other thing I would say is, we've seen really, to be honest, more over the last, probably year to 18 months a more of a contracting regime that's more commensurate with the risk associated with the program. So those that have lower technical maturity, higher risk, the customer has actually been much more receptive and cognizant that those probably are not going to be best delivered under a fixed price type of contracting regime. And so, you may be hearing words on the one end, but I think there has been a recognition more to make sure that the risk profiles commensurate with the right level of contracting. And that's shared both by the customer and as well as industry. And so there just had been, I think, a different approach. We'll see. You've got a change in administration and where that goes forward. But I would say there's been a recognition over the last 12 months that fixed price contracts for immature technology really doesn't help anyone.
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Safran of Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open.
Richard Safran: Thanks, Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning. What I'd like to ask is starting with your 2025 guide for 8% growth, I'd like to know if you could give us maybe a long-term look at MFC in terms of growth and margins and what the potential for the business is. Just kind of wondering the GD Rocket Motor deal and how that factors into your growth and margin outlook given the volume limitations you've had thus far. Thanks.
Jay Malave: Well, for MFC for 2025, it's really more of the same. We continue to see growth on programs like GMLRS, HIMARS PAC-3, JASSM and LRASM. And so many of the same growth factors and drivers in 2024 are also the growth drivers in 2025 that demand continues. We have projected orders growth in 2025, things like a multiyear definitization on JASSM and LRASM, which is pretty sizable multiyear contract. And so the demand cycle there, both domestically and international was quite strong. And as we've said before, that will be the growth driver for Lockheed Martin for years to come beyond 2025. And so again when you couple the backlog with the ongoing demand, we feel pretty solid again in these programs. There's just a solid back pinning of the underlying demand for those. On the margins we've talked about when you strip out the impact of the classified program, we've talked about 14%. If you look at the midpoint of our guide in that ballpark, we're right around 14%. Not necessarily as high as Maria reported on an adjusted basis for 2024. But that's because right now we're expecting some lower net profit adjustments, but their underlying margins are generally in line with what our longer term expectations are. And that's the way you should think about MFC, around 14%.
Operator: The next question comes from Ken Herbert of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Ken Herbert: Yes, hi Good morning.
Jay Malave: Morning.
Ken Herbert: Hey, Jay. In the past you've talked about working capital and specifically the opportunity there to improve the free cash flow. Can you provide a little bit more on what's implied in the 2025 guide for working capital improvement? And has anything structurally changed now as you look at the portfolio and the opportunity, as you've talked about taking days out and the ability to eventually or continue to drive towards sort of pre pandemic levels over time.
Jay Malave: Sure. You look at. I'll start with maybe 2024. We had a good year in 2024 in spite of some of the headwinds that we faced. We reduced our working capital days by a couple and we're in the mid-30s as far as cash conversion cycle. For our outlook in 2025, what's implied in there is about one day which essentially offsets the growth that we're going to see from we would otherwise see in working capital. So what we're trying to do here is just prevent it from being a use of cash and have it be neutral. The opportunity set obviously would be to drive beyond one day and there's still opportunity I talked about before, particularly in our contract assets, our unbilled receivable. There's some opportunity there as we work through on the F-35, both in production as well as sustainment, but there's really opportunities across the portfolio. Sikorsky has a number of opportunities there on their programs as well as even segments Space and MFC, those are outstanding working capital businesses on a standalone basis. But even so, there's opportunity in the contract assets there. So I would expect in the years to come that we still have opportunity to continue to drive asset productivity there and that's going to be part of our formula going forward, as it was in 2024 and our outlook for 2025.
Operator: The next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. Your line is open.
Gavin Parsons: Hey, thanks. Good morning.
Jay Malave: Good morning.
Gavin Parsons: Could you just dig in a little further on the free cash flow bridges, the EBIT and EPS bridges were super helpful in the deck. But just given a lot of moving pieces in cash flow like the F-35 inventory unwind pension contribution recovery, Lot 18 cash timing. Maybe I missed that one. But if we could just kind of do a bridge walk on cash flow, that would be great.
Jay Malave: If you just start from this year, adjusted cash flow at 6.1. So adjusted for the pension contribution in 2024. As we mentioned that we expected anywhere around close to a billion dollars of benefit on F-35 with the delivery of -- with higher deliveries as well as progress on the withholds. We also, though, as you remember, in 2024 got the benefit of significant international advances to the tune of $600 million. So partially offsetting, that is, it's the net impact of those two things. About $400 million in that ballpark. We do expect a benefit from taxes with lower R&D capitalization as that's coming down, and we expect a little bit of benefit from, I'll call it cash based net income. All that taken together takes us from $6.1 billion to the $6.7 billion midpoint. So those are the key drivers of free cash flow for 2025.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Deuschle of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Scott Deuschle: Hey, thanks, Jay. It looks like if you're guiding. Looks like you're guiding Aeronautics margins down about 20 basis points year-over-year in 2025. If I add back those unplanned charges to the 2024 base.
Jay Malave: Yes.
Scott Deuschle: Can you talk a bit about what drives that underlying margin decline, particularly given that you are on these newer contracts for F-35.
Jay Malave: Yes. So for F-35, we do have. I'm sorry, for Aeronautics in total right now, the outlook for their margins does assume lower net profit adjustments, and that's called an apples to apples basis. So excluding the impact of the $555 million in the C-5 adjustment in 2024, profit adjustments, there are declining, there is a mixed benefit. But right now the net profit adjustments offset that, and that's what drives the margins down from 10.2 to around 10. We also have classified growth, which is just a mixed headwind there, but that's -- we've got some benefits from F-16 margins as well. But bottom line, again, it comes back to the net profit adjustments being lower.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Matthew Akers: Yes. Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess a couple on F-35, you talked a little bit about the progress toward Tech Refresh 3. What exactly is left to get? Kind of the final withhold. How big is that? And are you assuming you get that within 2025 and then wondering if you could touch on Lot 19 and kind of how the discussions are going there.
Jay Malave: Well, on the TR-3 capability, we continue to make excellent progress there. There's a number of things that we still have to complete some mission system integration work as well as improving system stability overall. We expect that will continue throughout the year. We expect to meet some milestones this year. We're targeting as much as possible this year. But I think for purposes of financial modeling, we would expect, this to bleed into 2026. Ultimately, the declaration of full combat capability is one that is left with our customer. And so we'll be coordinating with them and working with them on that. But what I can tell you is that we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far and the team is working at a pretty good pace here with our supplier partners on improving A, the mission system capability and as well as improving overall system stability. The second part of the question was Lot 19. So that has been negotiated really in parallel with the Lot 18 negotiation. Just for clarity, Lot 18 is under undefinitized contract action. So we still have to definitize that under. As Jim mentioned, we expect that to be done in the first half of this year. And then shortly thereafter in the second half of this year, we would also expect to close out on the Lot 19 contract, which would be an order in a range of about $10 billion.
Operator: The next question comes from Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was curious on the charges that were unplanned, Jay, how should we think about the cash effect of those? And obviously the MFC part of that unplanned, you were just planning in the future. So I'm going to guess there's nothing really to think about there. But on the Aero side, $400 million of charges taken in the quarter, is that $400 million headwind being absorbed mostly in 2025. And then as we look to 2026, do you still have the pension funding requirement coming back about a billion dollars?
Jay Malave: Yes. Just starting with the Aero classified program. That will be certainly a cash flow drag over the next few years. It's not all born in 2025, but it's something that we expect over the next two years to three years that we will have to liquidate that from a cash perspective. As far as pension in 2026, we talked about ongoing cash contribution requirements. The formula to deal with that is similar to what we saw here and we've been talking about. We had the prior discussion here, one of the questions related to working capital. We're going to continue to see what we can do to drive working capital down, improve our asset productivity to offset as much as possible on the pension. And then we've got a very strong balance sheet that gives us a lot of optionality and flexibility. So we expect to continue to deal with pension with the options that we have before us.
Operator: The next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Gautam Khanna: Yes, good morning. I was wondering at the M&FC [ph] program that have the charge, is there an opportunity on that program as you scale it to improve the profitability dramatically? I'm just curious, over the option period I imagine demand is pretty strong for that product and I don't know if the pricing may adjust favorably at some point. If you could speak to that again.
Jay Malave: Again, it's a classified program, Gautam. So there's not really all that much. What I can tell you is outside of the fixed pricing related to this next phase, that the pricing would be open and we would expect to return to reasonable type margins over that period of time outside of where we have the fixed committed pricing. I wouldn't expect it to bounce back to MFC like margins at that point in time. There still would be kind of ramp ups that you got to deal with but certainly the margin profile will get substantially better.
James Taiclet: And we expect this to be a long lived program based on the technology and the value to the U.S. government. The next Air Force pilot, I can assure you this is something they will want.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.
Peter Arment: [Indiscernible] opportunities to maybe still grow your backlog. Your backlog is at record levels. It's up 10% for the year. Big drivers in MFC and space. But how are you thinking about the opportunities to grow backlog in 2025 and any international kind of awards that you're kind of pursuits that you would highlight? Thanks.
James Taiclet: So Peter, it's Jim. I'll just start with some of the public statements of the administration which is reforming the Pentagon an opportunity. There is more long lead time orders, less fragility in the system. In addition to that multiyear contracting which has been so far limited to munitions. Makes sense in a lot of other places in the Pentagon budget. So if some of those policy changes get implemented, you might see backlog for a company like ours accelerate due to multi years and longer lead time preorders. Jay?
Jay Malave: Yes. The line of sight, we do have a line of sight to growth again in 2025. I wouldn't say that it's 10%, but we certainly have some level of growth that we're expecting in 2025. On the backlog, I talked about the $10 billion order on the F-35 on Lot 19. I talked also earlier about the JASSM LRASM multiyear. That's in the range. That's multiple billions of dollars. There's others. There's the international opportunities as well. Türkiye's on the F-16 aircraft. There's just a whole slew of opportunities. We also have just continued F-35 sustainment contract which will also be multiple billions of dollars as well. CH-53K, Lot 9 is another one we'll be negotiating this year which is well above a billion dollars. So there's still an excellent line of sight to continue to grow this backlog. But as you know, we're also focused on making sure that we can accelerate the speed of our throughput and drive that backlog conversion faster.
Operator: The next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Your line is open.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, guys. Jim or Jay. Just a follow up on MFC. As you guys think about what DoD is signaling to you in terms of the peak production volumes on the key munitions and MFC, do you guys need additional supplemental bills to kind of get to those levels and sustain those levels? Or do you already have kind of funding line of sight from the Ukraine supplemental and maybe what's in the 2025 baseline budget? Maybe the 2026 baseline? I just wanted to get a sense of budget risk there in terms of what your peak rates are assuming.
Jay Malave: Yes, it's really not dependent on additional supplementals. I mean a lot of this is a lot of the capacity is going to be committed and or contracted with our customer. We just, and I'll run through a couple programs. We had always been under contract to get the 550 on the PAC-3 program in 2025. We initially self-funded the investment associated with getting ourselves a 650 on PAC-3. We recently received the contract award for incremental funding on that related to the facilitation. We are driving towards 14,000 on GMLRs. We've been driving, as Jim has mentioned in the past, to 4,000 on Javelin, 96 on HIMARS. And again, the line of sight to those and the funding that's been allocated to those is quite strong, much of which is under contract already. So we view that as fairly low risk at the moment.
Operator: The next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Douglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you.
Jay Malave: Hey Doug.
Douglas Harned: On F-35, there's been some noise as the new administration has come in about the F-35, but if I put all of that aside during the first Trump administration in each of the budgets F-35 volumes were cut. There seemed to be a view that we didn't need as many. Congress of course added some back. But when you look forward, you're looking at still 156 per year production rate for a while. How do you think about the interplay of budget decisions in the U.S. with what has been some very strong export demand? In other words, if we should see some reductions in quantities in the U.S. are you still very confident you're going to be able to continue with that 156 level?
James Taiclet: Doug, it's Jim. I'll start off and say, yes, I am confident of the 156 and I think it will come from strong demand from the U.S. government and from our international partners. And one reason for that is basically part of deterrence theory, is that you have to have the capability to make the adversary reconsider an adverse action against you. And China, based on open source reporting, has increased production of the J-20, which I don't believe just sort of personally that it's equivalent to F-35, but it is their fifth generation airplane to over 100 units a year. We're doing 156. We're ahead of them. I think if there was a dramatic change in even U.S. order book and production that might be a signal that would be adverse to maintaining an effective deterrent to them. And similar with munitions. Right? I mean, everybody's watched a Dirty Harry movie or Clint Eastwood movie, knows that when you run out of ammunition, you're highly, highly vulnerable. And that supports some of the conversation Jay was just having. So my view is that there are some very capable people coming into the administration. They understand deterrent theory. The last thing I think this President and administration would want is to create a period of vulnerability with any of our major adversaries in the next few years. So I feel really confident about F-35 production. And the other thing I'll add is that we can already control out of an F-35 up to eight autonomous drones. We've shown this as Secretary of the Air Force a few months ago. It's public knowledge. There's some classified things that we're doing in the same arena, if you will, to be able to drive manned unmanned teaming off the F-35 and the F-22. And the reason we're starting with the F-35 is because of TR-3. TR-3 gives the F-35 the three things that you need for an effective node and a 5G Internet of Things system, which is what we're talking about. Those three capabilities are data processing. With our core processor, it's about 10x from the prior it's data storage. We have a larger storage unit and multipath connection back to the cloud, as you define the cloud, ours is DoD classified. But those are the three technical elements you need to have to be able to drive 5G level connectivity among nodes in a network like this. And that's what we have to build. F-35 and we're upgrading F-22 in the same way will have at least one and often more orders of magnitude capability in those digital arenas than the fourth generation fighter jets we have. And so the capabilities alone that the F-35 can bring to an integrated fight with drones and manned aircraft is unique.
Jay Malave: Doug, I'll just also add that just maybe one data point here is that the, the age of the existing fleet is beyond 25 years. And so that is necessitating a recapitalization with the F-35. And so there's a certain reality that is going to require the demand of the F-35 to bring the age of that existing fleet back down.
James Taiclet: And then the last thing I'll say is that there's based on again, open source reporting, the experience of the Israeli Air Force against the Iranian air defense system, which they took out in one night with what they characterize as fifth generation aircraft and you can match up what's in their inventory with no losses. That would clear the way for 4th gen aircraft drones to come in and devastate that country if the Israelis decided to do so. That's the kind of impact that the high end platforms have. Especially if you can network satellite imagery, autonomous vehicle drone imagery and a companion control speed that no one else can muster. You can have that kind of lopsided victory. And that's another reason I think that the F-35 is going to demonstrate its value here through the Israeli experience.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Michael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe Jim or Jay just give a little bit more color on supply chain. I know the general update had been the demand signals were pointing to mid-single digit. Any changes with that under the new administration? And then just given supply chain and the new administration, should we think about that multiyear kind of framework being now firmly in mid-single digits for both revenue and cash flow?
Jay Malave: It's a good question. Let me just answer your question. Kind of supply chain operationally. We have seen improvement. We saw improvement certainly in 2024 and we're at levels where, they have approached and in certain cases have exceeded what they were pre-COVID. Having said that, there are still discrete issues that we're dealing with across the portfolio. I think MFC is a good example. They've done an outstanding job of managing a number of supply chain issues, but yet they still are. And so that while we have a solid growth outlook there and a strong growth outlook there, they're still being paced to a certain extent. And that bodes across much of the portfolio. Sikorsky's another one, CH-53K has been hampered and while we have seen improvement, it's still not to the level where we need to be operating at from a contractual standpoint. If we continue to see though what we have seen, then sure, I would feel a lot more confident in a multiyear outlook that is more in its 4% to 5% range like we're guiding for, for 2025, I think that we need to just go through a little bit more the passage of time as we go through midway through this year, we get a better outlook on how 2025 is shaping up and how that informs 2026. We'll be able to give you a clearer, a clearer view longer term. But at the moment we're encouraged by what we're seeing and surely we've seen it here in 2025 and we're starting to gain confidence, as I mentioned before, that it can continue in 2026.
Maria Lee: Sarah, let's take one more question. I think we're approaching the top of the hour. And then after this question we'll hand off to Jim for closing comments. So one more question please.
Operator: Thank you. The last question will come from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ronald Epstein: Hey, thanks guys for the question. Maybe just kind of like a two parter. The first part is easy, I think maybe when they discuss this iron dome over the U.S. isn't that NGI, the contract that you guys already won? Or am I thinking about that wrong? Because isn't that what NGI is?
James Taiclet: Ron, Jim here. It would be an integral part of a more comprehensive solution to homeland defense. And what the administration has laid out is a defense of the homeland against a multiple set of attack options for any adversary. One of them is, as you say, intercontinental ballistic missile attack. That is something that the NGI is specifically designed to accomplish. But then there's also hypersonic attack. We have a counter hypersonic attack effort in this company. Knowing that we're going to need to be able to do that. And by the way, to do it you're going to need AI and you're going to need high speed data transmissions and you're going to have to have multi sensors and multi domains to do it. So that's the second one. A third one is cruise missiles. Right. We've shown that for example, we can shoot down cruise missiles with lasers now and that could be part of the solution. And then maybe the lowest level adversary would be a cheap in country UAV attack, a drone attack on a public place or an air force base or some other U.S. located facility or asset. And that's another set of technologies which is counter UAS, and we haven't heard back from this administration yet on this topic, but we offered the prior administration at the SecDef [ph] level to organize a national team on counter UAS because I think we have some pretty good technologies. We want to add a lot more from some mid and large companies that do have the relevant technologies as well. So I might have ran you out of time on your second part of your first question. But that's what I think of when I consider what Iron Dome would have to look like.
Ronald Epstein: Got it. So it's a broader thing and just sort of just call it missile defense.
James Taiclet: Yes, yes. And there's a public statement by the U.S. Government that outlines a lot.
Ronald Epstein: Yes. If I can just squeak in one last one and then we'll. I know we got to go. How are you thinking about, I mean, Denmark is an important F-35 international customer. And there's a lot of rhetoric in the press around the U.S. wanting Greenland. How do you think about, about that and mixing that up with them being an important customer and what message that might send other customers?
James Taiclet: Look, these are policy issues by the U.S. Government completely out of our purview. So I'll just leave that there. The demand for the aircraft we talked about keeps building, especially in international customers. And really that's all I to comment on a policy matter such as this.
James Taiclet: All right. Thank you, Maria, for managing all the questions. Before we close, I want to thank the Lockheed Martin workforce for constantly pushing the boundaries of innovation to help our country and our allies accomplish their missions and maintain our ability to provide a strong deterrent to armed conflict. And if we must, defeat any enemy that attacks us. In the Air Force we used to call that fly fight and win. As we did in this first term, we look forward to a very productive working relationship with President Trump, his team and the new Congress to strengthen our national defense. We share a commitment to achieving peace through strength and we're focused on delivering the best mission critical defense technology in the world and at the greatest value to the American taxpayer. So with that, we'll wrap up the call. Thank you everybody that joined today and we'll see you in April on our first quarter call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

James Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2024 earnings call. The demand for Lockheed Martin systems and services remains robust across all four of our business areas. We ended Q3 with record backlog of more than $165 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3 in the quarter. Precision and Air defense munitions drove the increase, including large orders for Javelin, guided multiple launch rockets and joint air-to-surface standoff and long-range antiship missions. Compared with last year's third quarter, sales increased and segment operating margins expanded 20 points to 10.9%, led by Missiles & Fire Control, reflecting increased production volume. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion in the quarter as we continue to implement working capital efficiencies and optimization. High confidence in our future cash generation prospects supported our Board's recent decision, to raise the quarterly dividend by 5% to $3.30, the 22nd consecutive year of increases and to extend our share repurchase authorization. Turning to the F-35, we delivered 48 F-35 aircraft in the quarter. We expect to deliver 90 to 110 aircraft in 2024 and the remaining balance of the Lot 15 to 17 aircraft thereafter. In addition, TR-3 flight testing continues with 95% of combat capabilities validated and additional capabilities progressing. With over 1,040 aircraft delivered and growing, the F-35 fleet has become an essential component of the collective security of the U.S. and our global allies. For example, by the 2030s, over 600 F-35s will be in operation across more than 10 European nations. And in July, Greece announced that it will be the 19th nation to fly the F-35 and will acquire 20 aircraft. Plus the rollout of the initial F-35 for Poland in August marked a significant milestone in our 20-plus year partnership with that country. The F-35 superior sensors, stealth and data sharing capabilities are setting new standards for interoperability and joint operations with our allies, serving as the cornerstone for NATO's deterrence and defense posture. To further augment the capabilities of the F-35 and our other major platforms, we are investing heavily in autonomy and AI as well as other enabling digital technologies. As an example, our Lockheed Martin AI Center and our RMS business area conducted realistic teaming scenarios with uncrewed aerial systems or drones, and uncrewed ground vehicles at the U.S. Army in their recent experimental demonstration event. The successful demonstrations exhibited our abilities for using AI, by launching an autonomous drone to provide guidance and navigation instructions to a ground-based robot to help it navigate a dangerous urban environment and enable greater safety for our soldiers than any current approaches can do. The rapid integration of digital technologies and capabilities is one element of our 21st Century security strategy. Another example of this, in the third quarter, was Lockheed Martin Skunk Works team partnered with the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School to conduct full-scale live flight tests of an adaptive technology that makes real-time adjustments to flight control algorithms, resulting in substantial time and cost savings. And we do these kind of tech insertions on real, scalable combat platforms. Those that were implemented on mass can have theater-level effects on combat capability and thereby deterrents from great power armed conflict. The second element of 21st Century Security is designing resilience and antifragility into the defense industrial base. To this end, we signed a teaming agreement with our partner, General Dynamics in the third quarter for the production of solid rocket motors. The initial work will focus on producing SRMs for the GMLRS rocket and will start in 2025 at GD's facility in Camden, Arkansas. This third source of solid rocket motors will enable us to move more quickly to ramp production for critical defense capabilities and strengthen the defense supply chain. The third element of 21st Century Security is the implementation of a global and regional approach to production and sustainment with our allies and partners. We have expanded international collaborations to enable indigenous military capability development in countries, including Australia, Germany, Poland and India. I recently had the opportunity to discuss the expansion of Lockheed Martin sustainment and production operations in India with Prime Minister Modi in July, including growing the capacity and the capabilities of our joint ventures with Tata that already manufacture C-130J empennages, F-16 wings and helicopter cabins in Hyderabad. Turning to the U.S. defense budget. We are currently in a continuing resolution that funds U.S. government operations through December 20 of 2024. For our part, our teammates across all of Lockheed Martin will thereby be able to continue to work diligently to deliver on our customer commitments. We'll also be dedicated to delivering strong financial performance through the remaining months of 2024 and to carry that momentum into the coming year as well. So now I'll turn it over to Jay.
Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide an overview of our consolidated financials and operational highlights in the quarter before handing off to Maria, who will cover business area results, and I'll come back to discuss the 2024 outlook and some longer-term trending. Starting on Chart 4. Sales of $17.1 billion were up 1% year-over-year, led by MFC and RMS. As expected, Aeronautics was down primarily due to delayed revenue recognition of approximately $700 million associated with the lapse in F-35 program funding as we continue to work through Lot 18 negotiations. Normalizing for that impact, consolidated sales would be up 5% year-over-year. Segment operating profit of $1.9 billion was up 3% year-over-year, with consolidated margins at a respectable 10.9%. Net profit adjustments in the quarter were higher than prior year and amounted to 20% of segment operating profit. GAAP earnings per share of $6.80 increased 1% year-over-year, driven by higher profit and lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expense, a higher tax rate and lower pension income. Turning to new business. We recorded over $22 billion of orders in the third quarter, for a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.3, led by MFC with orders exceeding $8 billion and driving overall backlog to over $165 billion. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion in the quarter, aided by strong collections, including international program advances. This brings our year-to-date total free cash flow to just over $4.8 billion, enabling another $700 million of independent research and development and capital expenditures in the quarter. Further enhancing our leadership position in 21st Century Security and integrated deterrence. Finally, we returned $1.7 billion of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Turning to some key operational milestones and program highlights in the quarter. At Aeronautics, through the third quarter, we delivered 48 F-35s. In addition, the team continues to make progress towards Tech Refresh 3 combat capability with incremental milestones on track for completion in the fourth quarter. Beyond the F-35, the C-130 franchise had a very successful quarter. The worldwide fleet of over 550 C-130J Super Hercules surpassed three million flight hours, demonstrating the platform's unmatched global reach and multi-mission versatility. We also delivered the first eight C-130J-30 tactical air lifters to the Ohio Youngstown Air Reserve station in July, and delivered the first J variant aircraft to longtime C-130 customer, New Zealand. At RMS, the U.S. Marine Corps formally accepted the 23rd and final next-generation VH-92A Presidential helicopter built by Sikorsky, marking a significant milestone for the company, whose aircraft have flown every U.S. President since 1957. This is highly tailored solution, based on the proven S-92 helicopter, meets the Marine Corps unique and critical mission of supporting the Commander in Chief around the world. And at Space, in September, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin, a contract to design and build the next-generation Lightning Mapper instruments for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOA, GeoXO program. The baseline contract is valued at approximately $300 million for two instruments with options for an additional two. This award follows on the GeoXO award we received in June to design and build the core NOA spacecraft constellation. This continues our long tradition of designing and building weather and environmental spacecraft, including many earth observation instruments. I'll stop here and hand it over to Maria to talk more about the business area of financials.
Maria Ricciardone: Thanks, Jay. Today, I'll discuss third quarter year-over-year results for the business areas. Starting with Aeronautics on Chart 5. Third quarter sales at Aero declined 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower F-35 volume due to delays in the Lot 18/19 contract negotiations that Jay previously mentioned. Partially offsetting that headwind with higher volume at C-130 and the continued production ramp on the F-16 program. Segment operating profit decreased 2%, with lower volume and unfavorable mix being partially offset by higher profit booking rate adjustments, mainly due to a favorable adjustment related to a legacy C5 claim. With the F-35 surpassing 1,000 aircraft deliveries this quarter, I'd like to highlight a few other notable items from the other major platforms. More than 2,600 C-130 aircraft have been delivered to 63 nations, with more than 550 J variants delivered to 22 countries and Egypt set to become the 23rd. And the F-16 has delivered more than 4,600 aircraft to 27 countries over the past 50 years. Turning to Missiles & Fire Control on Chart 6. MFC had another solid quarter with sales up 8% year-over-year, driven by production ramps on precision fires programs within the Tactical & Strike Missiles segment, primarily guided multiple launch rocket system, GMLRS and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, LRASM. Segment operating profit increased 15% year-over-year, due to the higher volume and the higher booking rate profit adjustments primarily at PAC-3, while margins were again solid at 14.4%. MFC's book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was a strong 2.7, leading to another record backlog now over $40 billion, driven by continued global demand. In the quarter, the U.S. Army awarded the largest single year production contract for Javelin and related equipment, worth $1.3 billion to the Javelin joint venture, as well as a $4 billion contract for GMLRS. The Air Force awarded an over $3 billion multiyear large lot procurement contract for JASSM, LRASM, providing a key antifragility measure to increase industry resilience and ensure operations can be ramped more quickly going forward. Shifting to Rotary & Mission Systems on Chart 7. Sales increased 6% in the quarter to $4.4 billion, primarily driven by higher volume at integrated warfare systems and sensors on radar programs, as well as the Canadian Surface Combatant program. Sikorsky programs also saw higher volume led by CH-53K, Blackhawk and Seahawk. Operating profit was comparable to the prior year with higher volumes being offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. Finally, at Space on Chart 8, sales decreased slightly year-over-year. The reduction was driven by lower volume at commercial civil space, primarily on the Orion program, partially offset by higher volume at strategic and missile defense on our strategic reentry programs. Operating profit increased 5% compared to Q3 2023, driven by favorable mix, partially offset by lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance, ULA. Recently, Space was awarded a contract to continue nearly 70 years of partnership between the U.S. Navy and Lockheed Martin through the Fleet Ballistic Missile FBM program, a key component of our nation's strategic deterrence. Under the contract, we will provide Trident missile production support and reentry system hardware as well as operations and maintenance to support the readiness and reliability of the missile systems. FBM will continue to be a growth driver for Space for years to come. Now I'll turn it back over to Jay to wrap up our prepared remarks.
Jay Malave: Thanks, Maria. All right. Turning to Chart 9 and our outlook for 2024. With one quarter remaining, we've shifted to approximate point estimates that reflect increased expectations for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We have slightly reduced our share repurchase target for the year to approximately $3.7 billion, primarily due to the redeployment of capital to the Terran Orbital acquisition. All told, we still expect to return greater than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2024 via repurchases and dividends. Quickly stepping through the other metrics, we estimate sales of approximately $71.25 billion, reflecting growth of 5% over 2023 as our backlog continues to convert across the portfolio. We're also increasing the segment operating profit expectation driven by the higher sales volume to approximately $7.475 billion, and we continue to anticipate consolidated segment operating profit margins of approximately 10.5%. Moving to earnings per share. We're increasing our forecast by $0.30 from the prior midpoint to approximately $26.65. Primary drivers of the change are incremental profit of about $0.17, with other below-the-line items and taxes bringing in an additional $0.13. And lastly, on free cash flow. We now estimate approximately $6.2 billion for the year, up slightly from the prior midpoint while absorbing the unfavorable impact of the recent F-35 Lot 15 to 17 aircraft delivery settlement, which we estimate will be approximately $600 million in 2024 with expected recovery over the next few years. Before I talk about trending, I'd like to reiterate a few key assumptions regarding our 2024 outlook. First, we expect F-35 Lot 18-19 to be awarded this year, maintaining program funding and continuity. We continue to make progress in negotiations towards a contract that secures our mutual goals of delivering advanced fifth-generation fighter capability to our services. Should the negotiation time line extend beyond year-end, the financial impact would be one of timing. We could see about 3% or $2 billion of our sales shift into 2025 along with associated impacts to profit and about $1 billion of free cash flow. The second key assumption is that we continue to anticipate $325 million of full-year losses on the MFC classified program. That said, we will continue to assess facts and circumstances that could lead to the recognition of additional losses in the year. And third, this outlook does not assume any pension contribution in 2024. All right. So let's shift now to the outlook beyond 2024, and I'll provide a multiyear framework on Chart 10. To start with, our record backlog position provides a strong foundation for sustained top line growth over the coming years. Looking at sales through the 2027 time line, our baseline assumption still reflects a low-single-digit compound annual growth rate off of the higher-than-expected sales expectation for 2024. As I stated previously, the demand signals point to mid-single-digit growth through 2027, but the outlook remains tempered by our current assessment of the pace at which the value chain can meet the demand. Our confidence in a mid-single-digit growth rate will grow as clarity increases on new business campaigns, funding stability and capacity acceleration of the production systems. On segment margins, we anticipate improvement of 10 to 20 basis points per year based on our continued focus on operational excellence and program performance, combined with program derisking. So in other words, steady improvement to a more normal range of around 11% ROS by 2027. Thinking about EPS trends over the three-year horizon, while we anticipate year-over-year benefits from higher segment operating profit and a lower share count, these benefits will be diluted by continued FAS/CAS pension headwinds, particularly in 2025, and higher effective tax rates from a change in certain deductions based on current law. For free cash flow, we continue to target a low single-digit CAGR through 2027, based on delivering cumulative working capital reductions that partially offset known pension contribution headwinds. While offsetting the pension contributions dollar-for-dollar in each year with working capital reductions alone is a challenge. We have confidence that we could fully offset the headwinds and improve the growth rate to mid-single-digits through the combination of organic and inorganic cash generation initiatives. We'll provide more details in January as we show our plans with better visibility to 2024 pension asset returns, post-election policy and interest rates. Overall, this baseline multiyear framework remains consistent to the investment thesis we've discussed previously. We still expect single digit – low-single-digit free cash flow growth over the next three years, supplemented by share repurchases to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share return over the same horizon with upside potential. So in summary, on Chart 11. Performance year-to-date gives us confidence to raise the full-year outlook for 2024 and in our ability to deliver solid sales and free cash flow growth over the next few years. At the same time, we continue to invest in digital transformation capabilities and innovative technologies that will help differentiate our mission solutions for customers. And we remain focused on operational execution to deliver on our commitments and long-term value for our customers and shareholders alike. With that, Steve, let's open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: Yes, thank you. Good morning, Jim and Jay.
James Taiclet: Good morning, Ron.
Ronald Epstein: Maybe circling back on some of your prepared comments, Jim. When we think about the current situation in kind of the tactical fighter world, where it seems the Air Force is giving a rethink to NGAD, the system, what it should be. You mentioned some of the work you guys are doing on AI and drones. If you look at how Increment 1 of CCA was awarded to maybe nonusual companies, right, and kind of new players, how are you thinking about Increment 2? And what the interplay between man and unmanned systems, tactical fighters, drones? I mean, does it change how you think about going forward, what NGAD could be and what it means for Lockheed?
James Taiclet: Sure, Ron. We're preserving our optionality based on what the U.S. government and service is determined to be their strategy for tactical fighter deployment over the next 20, 30 years. And so part of that strategy is having our Skunk Works continue to develop technologies that could be implemented for a generation, sixth-generation tactile aircraft, it's a step function above what the F-22 and F-35 can do today. So we are investing time, talent and energy into that in Skunk Works which is in this setting, all we can really say about that. The second piece of it, though, is the crewed, uncrewed teaming, element of whether it's NGAD or F-35 plus CCA, if you will, or multiple CCAs. We're already working that out too. We've developed a pod that will enable the F-35 to control even today, CCAs, if you will. And we have a flight control system and communication system and development that will enable that as well. And that could be converted, I think, to F-22 as well. So we are working both of those elements. But the key part of it is you still got to have volume, and I'm an ex-Air Force pilot myself. We have to be able to meet the J-20, which is the Chinese combat tactical aircraft, fifth generation as well, with enough numbers in the Pacific, or at least field enough numbers of -- it's F-35 and F-22 now is the only really competitive jets against the J-20, 1:1. We have to field enough of those aircraft in a short enough time frame to maintain an effective deterrent in the Pacific. And the Russians are also developing fifth-generation aircraft as well. So the threat will emerge in Europe too. So we got to have volume to start with on fifth gen. We need to be able to bring autonomy in the CCA concept into fifth gen and sixth gen, if there is one. So we're keeping all of those avenues open and we're investing really in all three again to preserve the optionality for the defense industrial base and our partners to be able to deliver on which of those strategies or what combination that the U.S. government decides to pursue.
Jay Malave: And I'll just add, Ron, just in our outlook, the multiyear outlook that I gave you, that accounts for and assumes that we'll have incremental -- significantly incremental investment in areas such as autonomy, AI, crewed, uncrewed teaming and manned control systems. So we feel that our investment is going to the right places as these platforms and systems evolve.
James Taiclet: Yes. And as far as Increment 2 on the CCA, Ron, the way it's been described to us is Increment 1 was proof-of-concept, more of an experimental kind of approach. Increment 2 is going to be -- targeted to be fieldable combat-ready, scalable design and production of the uncrewed teaming half of the system. So we are fully dedicated to that. Like I said, we have Skunk Works working on both the parent and the child, if you will, when it comes to all CCA concepts and Increment 2 is going to be really where we're, I think, most competitive because we can show that we can control these vehicles with today's technology already at scale. So we're going to be eager to compete for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Jim and Jay. Jay, maybe one for you. Maybe if we could go to Slide 10. I appreciate you giving the long-term -- medium-term targets for low-single-digit revenue growth. Can you maybe rank order the segment with MFC leading. I think you've talked about mid-single-digit growth of $750 million there. And what other segments follow. What campaigns get you to that mid-single-digit opportunity for top line growth?
Jay Malave: Yes, sure. Thank you, Sheila and good morning. You kind of nailed it in your question. The leader of growth will be MFC over this time period through 2027. And I would put them at the high-single-digit clip very comfortably based on the backlog that they have today and the visibility we have to incremental orders. The other three business areas in this framework, at least starting off with this low-single-digit, the rest of them will be in this low-single-digit framework pretty kind of consistently. Now how do we go from a low-single-digit to a high single-digit? Quite frankly, a lot of that opportunity is already sitting in the backlog. If the system can convert, and I'd say the entire enterprise, so it's not just supply chain, it's our operations as well can convert on that backlog quicker, and we did see this in 2024. If you recall, we came into the year thinking that we would grow low-single-digit, and we converted that and changed it to 5% growth here in 2024. So under the same framework, it is a step change from where we are in 2024, but we demonstrated that we can improve throughout the year. So as that visibility gets better, that would enable us to go from a low-single-digit to mid-single digit. Yes, there are other campaigns and some of those are classified. If you go back a few years, we talked about the four pillars of growth, new awards was an element of that as well as classified growth. New awards, we got one of those, which is the next-generation interceptor. So that's already a win. The other one would be in our -- really our classified portfolio, and those are campaigns that will happen over the next, I would say, six to 18 months. But as I mentioned -- and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the foundation for the growth to mid-single digit is pretty solid. At least in the short term, is more of a conversion issue.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning everyone.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: Jay, I was hoping to get some more help from you on the MFC margin. Do the last two quarters suggest the operating performance is better? Or is it just that the loss accrual is loaded into the fourth quarter? And I guess, remind me why the accounting is that way as opposed to taking it all when you know you have it? And I don't know if you could talk about how you expect that to progress through '25. But I guess just fundamentally… 0 to 31 *** Part 31-end …is that way as opposed to taking it all when you know you have it? And I don't know if you could talk about how you expect that to progress through '25. But I guess just fundamentally, like is the new classified program or the overall operating performance in the segment, is it improving or worsening? Or is it just the volatility is accounting?
Jay Malave: Yes. I would say the volatility is kind of, I would say in this year-to-date, their performance is better than prior year. We've seen an improvement. When you put aside the losses related to the classified program, their profit adjustments year-to-date have shown growth, and they're performing, I think, pretty well in the base. So this was a good quarter, as an example, we didn't really record any losses related to the classified program, and we delivered 14.4% margins in the quarter, and that's essentially where they're operating this year ex the losses. You got it right as far as timing, we would expect, we recorded $100 million in the first quarter. So that would say that about $225 million were record or what's included in our guidance for the fourth quarter. As far as your question on the accounting, it's a good question. It really depends on the facts and circumstances and the probability. We have to make an assessment and a probability of the exercise of certain options. And so the visibility is clear as things are more short term and the visibility gets a little bit more murkier as you go out a little bit further. So you have to make assessments of similar facts such as customer interactions that we have, their intentions, visibility to funding over a longer period of time, the performance of the system is one in how we're doing from a testing perspective. So all of these factors taken together have to go into the assessment to determine if and when we record a forward loss. And so that's where we are. As far as 2025, a baseline assumption would be that we -- you go from $325 million to anywhere between say $250 million to $300 million in losses in 2025, assuming a one per year type of framework. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have to take another look at whether or not there will be additional losses that have to be recognized early on to your question. And again, that's a really quarter-to-quarter assessment that we have to make.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jim, just a follow-up first on CCA. Are you currently competing on the autonomy portion of Increment 1? And is that what gives you a better feeling for where Increment 2 Lockheed could be? And then, Jay, could you just update us on the ARRW classified contract? I think you booked another charge in the quarter. I'm just curious if there's any line of sight to when you're sort of back on the right side of that program?
James Taiclet: So Myles, based on the classification of the CCA program, especially longer term, I can't refer to it directly as far as who's competing for what element of it. But what I can tell you is, echoing in Jay, we are investing heavily in autonomy, AI, 5G connectivity distributed remote node cloud, those kinds of things that enable a CCA type device to be effective. Now we're testing in open air, I'll call it, these kind of technologies with existing platforms, which is another use case, but it's one we could talk about. So you've already seen potentially that we've got an autonomous Black Hawk up and running full capability helicopter that can do missions with you sitting on your couch in your living room, programming the mission in and changing it in a flight on your iPad, right? This is scalable, big hardware, big effect platforms that can be elevated in their capability with autonomy, AI, et cetera. We've also done the same thing within F-16 with the Air Force that shows that we can actually dog fight an F-16 without a pilot in it and be effective. So these technologies. If you -- one could probably surmise if you can apply them to legacy hardware at that level of scale that you can certainly apply them to hardware that is a smaller scale on crude as well.
Jay Malave: On the question on the classified program at aeronautics we did realize incremental risk in the quarter. In the press release, we had about $80 million there. Year-to-date, we're about $145 million. So we have, obviously, realized some incremental learnings that have converted to incremental losses. It's a classified program, so I can't really talk too much about what it is. But what I can tell you is that we are essentially meeting our scheduled objectives, albeit at a higher cost. And I would say the cost is really a function of the aggressive pricing that we bid originally. And so as we recalibrate, we are kind of keeping an eye on our cost. We'll do continuous reviews, as you would expect us to do. And we'll have another review here in November with the team so we can go back and understand and pressure test the risk management plan. But it's not just an oversight function. I think it's incumbent upon us as a leadership team to not only provide the oversight, but also make sure that we're providing the tools and the resources to make sure they're successful. This program will be managed as a whole team, and we're all in it together. And as I mentioned on the cost, it's -- again, it was bid aggressively. Jim and I have been pretty firm over the past few years that really reining in those practices, and we really haven't seen any of those since that time. And so we've got a contractual commitment that we've got to meet, and we will meet, and we'll manage this program as best as we possibly can. And I think part of what we're trying to do is change the trajectory, drive towards better outcomes, while at the same time deliver the mission capability that we've contracted to give our customer.
James Taiclet: And Myles, I can speak to one command and control system that we have demonstrated because it was, again, an open space. Recently, the Air Force put on its [indiscernible] space force put on its sort of annual gathering, if you will, outside of Washington, D.C. And in our -- it's a bit of a trade show set up, so it was public. We were demonstrating to our customers there in open space, again, not classified, our ability to use that iPad technology to control eight CCAs off an F-35 flight control and comm systems. So we've already shown that out in the open. But again, that's technology we've been working on for literally a decade or two at Skunkworks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you. On F-35, you said that you expect a lot -- you don't know for sure, but the lot 18 and 19 negotiations hopefully will be completed in Q4, [indiscernible] three are 95% through. What I'm trying to understand are really two things. A lot of times, you can have 5% left on something. We've -- this has been going on a long time getting Tech Refresh three done. How do we get confident that you're going to get there in Q4. And does this have an interplay with the lot 18 and 19 negotiations? Because if I can just ask separately, we're trying to understand what the cash implications are in 2025, if you get all this done or perhaps if it slips?
James Taiclet: So Doug, it's Jim. I'll start off. I want to lay out the fundamental framework of the F-35 program. And then I'll turn it over to Jay for some of the cash flow impacts and expectations in the financial results of that. So first of all, just to reiterate, there's a very important distinction between the F-35 production system and how we book revenue and profit on the production system versus the event of final aircraft delivery, which is actually a fairly small proportion of the revenue and profit that an aircraft F-35 aircraft generates for industry, right? So that important distinction. Now there's two current program conditions that you touched on that affect both of these outcomes, right? So what I want to also emphasize is both of the outcomes are not necessarily economic value outcomes. They are timing-related outcomes. So there's a time value money aspect of it, but the economic value of an F-35 that's delivered out of the system is not much affected, if you will, by these two issues, but the timing is effective. So let me just start with TR3 software finalization. So that's one of the conditions that we're managing through with the F-35 program and how that affects the delivery schedule. So about 1.5 years ago, we had conversations, and I did personally about a release one and release two concept. The government calls that truncation, but that's really what the concept is like we would do. And tech or telecom, we're going to do a release one of software. We're going to work through the discovery of that. And then when that is ready, we will be able to have an initial product. And the initial product is TR3 which is capable of doing unit standup, facing operations and training at operating Air Force and Navy and Marine bases as well as our allies with the TR3, I'll call it, again, release on software in it. You can fly the jet, you can practice basic and advanced fighter maneuvers. You can deal with -- develop tactics in your squadron and you can train your maintainers on how to do this new aircraft. So if you're swapping out F-15 Squad and two F-35 Squad and the maintainers actually need to get their hands on the planes just as much as the pilots do. And then make sure all the tooling and everything is working for them. So Release 1 is what's being delivered now. That was the 48 in the third quarter. They all have Release 1, you can fly the jet. What it doesn't have are some of those incremental software validations that show that all combat systems and all weapons will be able to be effectively deployed because the testing program in flight test and bench test has been completed and we get a certification of reliability for that weapon, for example. There are a lot of test points there. And those test points are going to be developed, not just in the fourth quarter, but they're going to be developed over the course of 2025 as well, because when I say a weapon, is it an [indiscernible] is it an A9, what weapon are we talking about? There's literally dozens of weapons and there are multiple test points on things like the distributing after system, et cetera. So this is a complex path to what I'll call Release that's the full up combat capability. And as we work through those capability certifications individually, they'll be diminishing cat withholds along the way as those flight tests are completed and the certifications happen. Jay can kind of aggregate that for you in a minute. But that's how this part of the program works on a fundamental basis. So we feel that our projection of in 2024, 90 to 110 deliveries out of that process and to Release 1. In 2025 and beyond 180 deliveries a year of F-35. Now those are going to be a mix of those coming off the line, brand new and those that are parked. So the 180s will be a mix of those. We're working on a weekly basis right now to prioritize specific aircraft deliveries, literally one at a time. There's one go to the Dutch Air Force first and the marine second. And whenever we reprioritize what we're doing by the week based on the needs of the customer base, we need to change bill of materials. We'll do other things and parked aircraft may remain when a new aircraft may come right out to the fleet. So the complexity of this TR3 software definitization and release is going to take some time, but we will be able to deliver a mix of aircraft above the 156 production rate for the next few years because we'll be mixing based on what the customer is looking for. So that's one of the issues that you talked about. The other issue is actually, I would consider it completely unrelated from this. And that issue is any lot negotiation for a program such as this and at the scale that this program is at. So we are on a lot of contractual negotiation with the U.S. government. And by we, I mean, our major suppliers with us and all the way down to our smaller suppliers. Now currently, that lot negotiation is '18 and '19, and it's not completed yet. And under the federal acquisition regulation, if the government does not have a formal agreement with the supplier completed, the government cannot pay for either work being done under that undefinitized contract. In fact, it's not completed contract to be clear. Or pay for a product that is actually completed either. So that is where we as an industry then have to prioritize keeping our production system on pace, while the government by law, cannot pay us. So it's essential for the health of the lower-tier suppliers that we do that. We all kind of step up and do it as an industry. But the prime and major subs cannot book our revenue and profit even though we're expending cost. And that's where the cash impact of the negotiation comes in. We're not going to stop the production line because it would be unwise, I'll say, until the formal agreement is signed, we are going to keep it going until the formal agreement is signed, at which time these cash payments will be releasable. So those are the two issues we're facing. I want to say one of the things Doug -- why you've asked about this top of F-35. This isn't just a Lockheed Martin commitment to make this program a success. It's an industry-wide commitment, and I would also add a government commitment to make it a success. I'll just give you a few of the things that we've been part of and led over the last, I'd say two, three months. We held a CEO Summit of the top five industry partners in Fort Worth at the factory where we took an entire day determining how we could integrate our systems, IT systems, test systems, our processes, how we develop subassemblies and other items that go on the jet and integrate them with the jet those processes and personnel, moving more people between companies on either a temporary or almost semipermanent basis to make sure we've got the best talent working on every problem. So that's one thing that we've done. That same CEO level team followed up with the government and the meeting there was chaired by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the joint program office leader was their General Schmidt, the U.S. Navy and Marines had their air bosses there and that was in the Pentagon to lay out a similar integration framework with U.S. government systems, processes and personnel that's appropriate under law and regulation. And then we add another CEO update with U.S. senior government officials and this was just two weeks ago and seven partner nation customer officials in Washington to trade status of what we were all doing together. And in two more weeks, I'm bringing my executive team at Lockheed Martin across all the businesses and functions. We're going to gather in Fort Worth to make sure that every resource, every operational practice, every supply chain element that we can bring from across the company and certainly all the technical talent is devoted to this program. That is what we are doing to make sure this is a success. And the last thing I'll say there is that the customers need and want this aircraft. That was the opinion of the U.S. government in our meeting with the chief. There are six customers since 2020. I think these are all the competitions that we're in actually that chose the F-35 that weren't in the original partner group or the original order team. Switzerland, Finland, Germany, Canada, the Czech Republic and Greece. And then follow-ons from partners that already have the aircraft in operation also were added Japan, Netherlands, Republican Korea and Israel. So the demand for the aircraft and actually essential need for the aircraft is there. Industry is getting together with the government, and I think in ways that we haven't done before to really make this a success. And we've got to work our way through the lot negotiation, which is, again, it's a timing issue as far as payments, and we got to work our way through TR3 integration, which is a technical issue. But literally, it's an all hands on deck, not just an industry, but I'd say in government to get this all done. Jay, any...
Jay Malave: Yes. Let me just add to -- Doug, I'll try to give you a little bit of color on the cash impact to your question. As Jim mentioned, what we're looking at here is an output estimate of about 180 aircraft deliveries per year over the next three plus years. So effectively, what will happen is cash collections will smooth out over this period of time. This is important to point out that, that remains consistent with the low single-digit free cash flow growth framework that we've articulated today and previously. Just maybe a little bit on 2024. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we estimated the impact this year of unfavorable impact of about $600 million. That consists of two factors. Number one, less deliveries than the 156 rate. So we'll deliver in that range of 100 aircraft or so. So there's going to be less aircraft delivered and so there's an impact for cash flow from that. The second impact is the impact of the withholds. While we will release some of those with holds this year based on completion of milestones, there will still be some that carry over into next year and a little bit into 2026. Now in 2024, that's unfavorable impact was $600 million, that was entirely offset by other working capital efficiencies in the rest of the portfolio of about $600 million, mostly through advances that we've seen there. And so the net impact and then what enabled us to deliver the same free cash flow and, in fact, better than the midpoint that we had originally guided to was that offset. As you go to 2025, will deliver more aircraft. And so we will see the benefit of having delivered more aircraft and we will also see the benefit of having incremental withholds released. I would quantify that today at around $300 million to $400 million. And then that will then continue to flow in 2016 and beyond. And hopefully, that helps.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Rich Safran of Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Jay, on your opening remarks on pension, I think in the past, you made some comments about possibly reducing some out-year pension headwinds. So I want to know if you could maybe update us on what your thinking is there, if you still intend to reduce the headwinds after 2025 using debt or cash? And if so, what the timing of that might be?
Jay Malave: Yes. Thanks, Rich. Essentially, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the inorganic and organic means of managing this pension headwind. The inorganic would essentially be the issuance of debt as a primary enabler to be able to do that. That's still on the table. As I said on my prepared remarks that we're going to go through between here and the end of the year and finalize our plans based on various factors. And as you would expect, we're trying to exhaust all of the opportunities on an organic basis. So what can we bring out in working capital over this period of time to be able to offset as much as possible. To the extent that we can't, we do have the ability to go on financing to take out. I think the key takeaway there is that I remain confident that we'll be able to do that through the combination of organic working capital reduction as well as some level of inorganic mostly on the debt side.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Just wanted to clarify on the longer-term framework relative to what you had said previously on 2025. I think you had talked about a 2025 growth in line with 2024, which is at 5%. So is that still the case or not? I know this is out through 2027. If you could just touch on that. And then Maybe, Jim, if you could touch on progress on the solar rocket motor side of things in terms of how that's going? Obviously, you announced this partnership with General Dynamics during the quarter as well. Thanks.
Jay Malave: Just on the framework as it relates to 2025. 2025 is very consistent with the multi-year framework that's on that chart, which is our starting point here is a low single-digit growth framework off of the 2024 number. And again, it's -- we're looking at MFC being the driver there, kind of starting off at a high single-digit rate. And the other business areas being either flat, slightly flat or on the up in this low-single digits. And so that's really our starting point. Again, we'll give a lot more color in January as we finalize these plans. But I'd say '25 is consistent with what we're saying in the multi-year framework. I guess just a reminder, David, I think it applies to '25 as it does in the three year framework. When you went to '24, we started at low-single digit. We upgraded it to mid-single digit. I think as our visibility improves, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's still the case where we could be mid-single digits in 2025, but we need to see it come through. We need to see the production and operating systems be able to consistently grow at a mid-single digit CAGR, which is a lot easier said than done in the environment that we've been living under over the past few years.
James Taiclet: And David, as far as the solid rocket motor industrial base, I think this is a really positive example of how industry does come together in the service of national security, right? So first of all, I've just circulating this question with our Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, who's outstanding on Northrop Grumman and Aerojet Rocketdyne, which is now managed by L3 Harris. My question to Frank is, are these companies putting all the resources that we think they could be putting into their solid rocket motor operations, quality, delivery schedule, personnel, et cetera and open to us collaborating with them to make sure those deliveries happen? And his answer to me was yes. So our industry -- existing industry partners are stepping up to try to meet the elevated demand and investing to do that. So that's great. But we still need a third source from, I think, an antifragility perspective as we call it. And that is a partnership with General Dynamics, and that started off at the CEO level, and we figured out there was complementary capabilities between General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin, where we could actually have the design done at Lockheed Martin for the SRM and the General Dynamics had the ability, the facilities and the kind of production operations and personnel that could actually produce it. And so we are working together on that. We'll have to get that new solid rocket motor certified. It will be, again, Lockheed Martin IP design, if you will, and General Dynamics is standing up simultaneously the ability to produce them at rate. We have to do a few test articles next year in 2025. There'll be further testing that's done by the services to get their certification, the military services in 2026 and should be producing at rate we hope by 2027. And that will add a third supplier for the national defense industrial base, not just for Lockheed Martin, but for others as well and really strengthen our ability to produce these systems.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question.
Jay Malave: Good morning.
Jason Gursky: Jay, I just want to really, really pound the table -- not pound the table [indiscernible] horse here, I should say. And make sure I fully, fully understand the multi-year outlook here. So what you're saying is low-single digits as the baseline you can outperform that into the mid-single digits. So long as the supply chain and the production system kind of maybe performs as well as it did this year relative to expectations. What's the blue sky scenario here? Let's say that the supply chain all steps back into place, the production system is working well. You are then in this context, producing mid-single digit growth. But I would imagine that you've got a pipeline of additional opportunities out there. Is there a blue sky scenario where you're actually doing better than mid-single digit?
Jay Malave: It's a great question, Jason. Let me just first say terms in the framework. I mean, obviously, over 2025, there's better visibility than there would be for 2027. So the outlook feels good. And so my comment in terms of confidence as far as the demand signal being able to drive to a mid-single digit growth rate in '25 is heightened by better visibility. If you think about what we've seen in over, and I'll take '24 as an example in answer to your question, given what we've seen the demand cycle would have also enabled a higher growth rate than 5% in 2024. So I think the answer to your question in the short term is yes. I don't know that I could sit there and say that a multi-year framework would be a high-single digit number. But I think that given all the right circumstances, you could definitely see a year that could deliver high-single digit. But again, we're starting from low, we got to get to mid, we get to mid and then we can talk about anything beyond that. First things first.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Rob Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Thanks very much. Good morning.
Jay Malave: Good morning.
Rob Stallard: Jay, a question on the cash situation. Can you give us an idea of just how much working capital benefit you have to get through in the next couple of years to offset pension? And just how risky is this prediction?
Jay Malave: Well, Rob, the way I would characterize it is just quick math, one day equates to about $200 million of free cash flow. And I would say through '25 and '26, we would have to do at least two days of working capital improvement. So is it possible? Yes, in both years, so you'd have to do cumulatively four days through '25 and '26. It's possible, but it's a stretch. And that's why I believe kind of a better, higher confidence plan would be to combine the initiatives on working capital with some of potential inorganic capabilities or cash generation with the ability to really draw that back down over a period of time with continued cash flow growth. And so I think it's -- what I would say next year is that we've probably got two days that are not yet solution between now and the end of the year that we got to go figure out. And to the extent that we can and that relates to 2025, will that be -- the inorganic becomes the gap filler.
Maria Ricciardone: All right. Steve, this is Maria. I think we've come to the top of the hour. So I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.
James Taiclet: Sure. Thanks, Maria. Look, I just want to recognize the employees across Lockheed Martin, their dedication, their resilience and they consistently are innovating now in ways I think we never have and cooperated across businesses and functions before like we never have. So I want to really make sure that they're recognized this afternoon. We want to make sure that our allies in our country can defend itself and therefore, deter any aggression against us, and that's what they think they're doing and what they are doing every day. So I want to thank them and thank you for joining us all. I look forward to connecting you again for our Q4 call in January. So we'll see you then. Steve, that concludes the call for today. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. On behalf of today's conference call. We'd like to thank you for your participation, and thank you for using AT&T. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-23 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Maria Ricciardone, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations.

Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Over the past few months, Lockheed Martin's people, systems and platforms have again demonstrated their ability to enhance security in Eastern Europe, the Red Sea and the Middle East. From the PAC-3s critical role in air defense, to the Aegis Combat System with AI augmentation to the F-35 of this advanced sensor and data management capabilities, our company has made major contributions to Allied and Partner defense. We continue to demonstrate the impact of our 21st Century security strategy by harnessing the latest digital technologies to continuously improve mission effectiveness, strengthening and scaling defense production system, and expanding industrial cooperation among our allies and partners. Consequently, demand for our defense technology solutions remains robust, with a backlog of nearly $160 billion greater than two times our annual revenue. Our strong performance so far in 2024 extends beyond blast backlog as well giving us confidence to raise our 2024 full year outlook for sales, segment operating profit and EPS. In the second quarter, sales increased 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially and reflected growth in all four of our business segments. The supply chain continues to improve and defense outlays also continue to increase. Our focus on operational execution helped us achieve segment operating margins of 11.3%, up 20 basis points compared to last year's second quarter and free cash flow of more than $1.5 billion, an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. Jay and Maria will talk more about the specifics of the quarterly results in a moment, but suffice it to say, we are pleased with our financial performance and momentum so far in 2024. I'm especially happy to report the progress we have made on the F-35 program. As announced last week, we began deliveries of the first Technology Refresh 3 or TR-3 configured F-35 aircraft to the US government. The TR-3 upgrade and further Block 4 enhancements represent a critical evolution in capability and their full development remains a top priority for us. These and further software updates over the life of the program will ensure that F-35 remains an effective deterrent to aggression and the cornerstone of Joint All-Domain operations now and decades into the future. We continue to produce at a rate of 156 aircraft per year and expect to deliver 75 to 100 aircraft in the second half of 2024. Over 95% of TR-3 capabilities are currently being flight-tested and we look forward to delivering full TR-3 combat capability to the customer. In addition, we expect deliveries of F-35 aircraft to exceed production for the next few years. Jay will talk about the financial aspects of our current status in a moment. Continued close collaboration with the joint program office, or the JPO as known and across our industry partners has been and will be essential to meet and exceed expectations of this critical national defense program in a timely and cost-effective manner. I met with my F-35 industry CEO colleagues in Fort Worth recently to set plans for enhancing the cooperation on our software and hardware and test integration processes, among other initiatives to increase speed and efficiency in the program. The TR-3 hardware and software provide a significant upgrade in computing power that enables major improvements and capability to our airmen, sailors and marine as well as to our partner and allied nations. International customers continue to recognize the superior capabilities of this, the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world in key aircraft node in the DoD's Joint All-Domain architecture. On the international front, Israel announced a third squad of F-35As, increasing their fleet by 50%. Greece is in the final stages discussion with the U.S. government to procure the F-35 and we continue to see interest from Romania as well as a potential new customer. Beyond the F-35 is the quarterback of Joint All-Domain operations our ongoing collaboration with the U.S. military during major exercises with deployed operational units exemplifies our commitment and ability to enhance readiness and integrate capabilities across all of our customers' missions and priorities. In June, new advanced capabilities from across Lockheed Martin contributed to the tenth iteration of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's Valiant Shield exercise. During this exercise, there were several significant milestones demonstrating how we are continually improving our forces capabilities and enhancing our deterrence posture. One example is that we successfully integrated digital command and control capabilities with the Indo-Pacific Command's Joint Fires network, enhancing real-time decision-make commanders and operational agility for the forest. Our operational planning data fusion engine was employed to coordinate joint operations using live real-time data producing actual tasking orders at combat relevant speed. And another example from the same exercise, Lockheed Martin Space and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics jointly demonstrated the ability to autonomously optimize intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or ISR, collection and enhance their imagery for quick, automated target detection and classification, facilitating data delivery across a wide range of space-based and airborne platforms like never before. In addition, the U.S. Army tested our Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, against the moving maritime target in the Pacific Ocean. This next-generation missile enables further improved range and precision to deter potential adverse series from even greater distances. According to the Army, this test is a significant step in the PrSM programs progress. We've also moved toward realizing the 21st Century Security Joint All-Domain vision with the signing of a landmark agreement with Australia's Department of Defense to build their future joint air battle management system. They call it Project AIR6500 Phase 1. As we've discussed before, this system will provide the Australian defense force with leading-edge integrated air and missile defense capability using next-generation technologies to combat high-speed threats and establish Australia's integrated air and missile defense as one of the most highly advanced in the world. We also continued to demonstrate 21st Century security in other innovative ways. In May, our Skunk Works Tactical artificial intelligence team successfully executed their second set of flight tests with the University of Iowa’s, Operator Performance Laboratory. RAI flew an L29 jet aircraft by means of heading, speed and altitude command sent directly to the onboard autopilot than to the plans flight controls. This test has shown our AI team can rapidly develop, iterate and integrate artificial intelligence technology for autonomous flight operations. We're also making great progress in another leading-edge defense tech initiative, hypersonic strike, which is a critical element of deterrence in today's world. As announced by the Department of Defense in June, the US Navy and US Army completed an end-to-end all up ground flight test of a common person missile, core to the Navy's conventional prompt strike or CPS and the army's long-range hypersonic weapons programs. The test marked a major step forward for the nation's development of hypersonic systems by Lockheed Martin. Pivoting to the supply chain, we continue to explore opportunities to drive our concept of anti-fragility across the global defense industrial base. For example, we recently signed a collaborative memorandum of understanding with Ryan Mittal to work together on land, air and naval opportunities. One of our first initiatives is the new Global Mobile Artillery Rocket System or GMARS is a highly interoperable two-pod launcher system intended to fire the MLRS-based munitions. Combining these combat-proven systems will help address the growing demand for long-range rocket capabilities in Europe and elsewhere. On our PAC-3 program, international collaboration remains strong as well, including development of indigenous capabilities with the opening of a PAC-3 MSE launch tube production line in Poland, as well as a memorandum of understanding with Grupo Oesía in Spain to provide an opportunity to manufacture factory MSE parts for worldwide customers. Spain and the United States also formalized an agreement for Spain to purchase pack free MSE missiles and related support, making Spain PAC-3s 16th partner nation. I'd also like to briefly discuss the latest status of the US defense budget. The House approved their version of the FY '25 defense appropriations. So the focus now shifts to the Senate where the process continues before the reconciliation phase later this year. We believe our portfolio is well-aligned to current and future customer mission priorities, including air superiority with the F-35 and CH-53K and Black Hawk or UH-60M. Our integrated air and missile defense with PAC-3 and NGI, hypersonics with CPS and the LRHW I just mentioned a minute ago and tactical strike weapons and munitions with JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, JAVELIN and GIMLERS. Ultimately, we look forward to the conclusion of the USG appropriations process and the continued utilization of the existing supplement mental funding. On the international front, I was encouraged by conversations I had at the recent NATO Summit a few weeks ago in Washington. International partners and allies remain steadfast in their pursuit of elevated defense spending to strengthen the overall integrated deterrence posture of the alliance given the tragic and ongoing conflict in Ukraine. I'll now turn it over to Jay for award highlights and additional commentary on our financial results.
Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim. Similar to last quarter, I'll provide an overview of consolidated financials and touch on a handful of operational items before handing off to Maria, who will cover business area financials, and then I'll come back to discuss the updated outlook. Starting on chart 4. The positive momentum we had to begin the year continued into the second quarter with sales up 9% to over $18 billion, led by RMS and MFC. As Jim mentioned, throughput remained strong reflecting an improving supply chain and internal operating cadence. Segment operating profit of $2 billion was up 10% year-over-year, and consolidated margins were 11.3%. With all four business areas achieving double-digit return on sales, the first time since the third quarter of 2022. Net favorable profit adjustments in the quarter were higher than prior year and were 21% of segment operating profit, driving the stronger margins. GAAP earnings per share of $6.85 increased 3% year-over-year, driven by higher profit and lower share count, partially offset by severance impairment charges at RMS and Sikorsky, higher interest expense and lower pension income. On the new business front, we recorded over $17 billion of orders in the second quarter for a book-to-bill ratio just below one. We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to just under $2.8 billion, and we continue to make the necessary investments in innovation and infrastructure to position the company and our customers for future success with $400 million -- $405 million in research and development and $370 million in capital expenditures the second quarter. Finally, we returned over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Now, I'll touch on a few business activities in more detail. The order strength continued at MFC with a book-to-bill over two in the quarter, led by the $4 billion plus Army award spanning multiyear PAC-3 delivery requirements and supporting our production ramp projections. And Poland officials signed a letter of acceptance to purchase 400 JASSM ERs, the largest international order and program history, providing another ally with the latest generation JASSM variant. At Sikorsky, its platforms remain in high demand as the US State Department announced approval for four foreign military sales of Black Hawk to Austria, Brazil and Sweden. This opens the door to the potential sale of 36 Black Hawks, adding 12 helicopters each to each country's existing Blackhawk fleet. In addition, the government of Greece signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 35 UH-60M BLACK HAWK helicopters. These upgraded aircraft will support the Hellenic Ministry of Defense's ongoing modernization. It will serve as a dependable multi-role helicopter with unmatched interoperability to support vital national and allied security missions. In the space domain, late last month, NASA selected Lockheed Martin to develop and build the nation's next-generation weather satellite constellation for NOAA known as Geostationary Extended Observations, or GeoXO. This award builds on our prior work with environmental sensing technologies, which recently culminated with the launch of GOES-U, which will leverage advanced instruments and rapid updates to provide crucial data for weather forecasting, severe storm tracking and climate monitoring. Let me stop here and hand it over to Maria to get into the business area of financial detail.
Maria Ricciardone : Thanks, Jay. Today, I'll discuss second quarter year-over-year results for the business areas, starting with Aeronautics on Chart 5. Second quarter sales at Aero were up 6% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes across F-35 and the continued production ramp on the F-16 program. Segment operating profit increased 5% with higher volume and favorable mix being offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. Regarding aircraft deliveries, we resumed F-35 deliveries in Q3, as Jim shared, and we've delivered our 1,000 F-35s. On F-16, we delivered four in the second quarter and are targeting around 20 for the year. For 130J, we delivered five in the quarter, reaching a milestone of 2,700 deliveries of this critical tactical airlifter and expect around 20 deliveries for this year. Turning to Missiles and Fire Control on Chart 6. MFC had another strong quarter with sales up 13% from the prior year, driven by production ramps on a handful of our precision fires programs within the tactical and strike missile segment, primarily Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, GMLRS and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, LRASM. Segment operating profit increased 21% year-over-year due to higher profit booking rate adjustments led by the PAC-3 and Apache programs margins returned to 14.5%, which is more in line with historical rates. MFC backlog reached a record level of almost $35 billion in Q2 supported by continued global demand for several of our missile ammunition programs. Key awards included the PAC-3 award that Jay mentioned as well as $1.3 billion in combined awards for launchers, including HIMARS, and M270 upgrades and a $500 million follow-on production contract for JAGM and HELLFIRE to support U.S. and international customers. On the delivery front, I'll highlight a few of the key program quantities in the quarter. We delivered 100 PAC-3 interceptors, more than 2,000 GMLRS rockets, over 2,700 HELLFIRE missiles and 11 HIMARS systems. Shifting to rotary emission systems on Chart 7. Sales increased 17% in the quarter to over $4.5 billion primarily driven by higher volume at integrated warfare systems and sensors on radar and laser programs as well as the Canadian Surface Combatant program. Sikorsky programs also saw higher volume led by BLACK HAWK and CH-53K. Also of note in the quarter, we delivered five S-70 helicopters to international customers, which resulted in about $115 million of revenue on a passage of title POT basis. Operating profit increased 9% year-over-year due to higher volume, partially offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. Now, for a brief summary of helicopter deliveries. In addition to the five S-70 helicopters I mentioned, Sikorsky delivered five Black Hawks, four combat rescue helicopters, and one VH-92 Presidential helicopter in the quarter. On the delivery front, a few of the key program quantities in the second quarter, we -- yes, sorry about that. Let's go to space. Finally, with space on Chart 8. Sales increased 1% year-over-year. The growth was driven by higher volume on strategic and missile defense programs, primarily hypersonics and Fleet Ballistic Missile, FBM. Partially offsetting this growth was lower volume on classified programs and Orion. Operating profit increased 11% compared to Q2 2023, driven by favorable mix and higher profit booking rate adjustments. Now, I'll turn it back over to Jay to wrap-up prepared remarks.
Jay Malave: All right. Thanks Maria and let's shift over to the outlook on Chart 9. Given our strong year-to-date performance, sustained back position, and improving visibility into key programs, we're raising our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook for sales, segment operating profit, and earnings per share. We're increasing sales by $1.75 billion at the midpoint and tightening the range to $70.5 billion to $71.5 billion. The new midpoint reflects a solid 5% growth from 2023 with increases across all four business areas. We're also increasing segment operating profit expectation based on the higher sales with the new range of $7.35 billion to $7.5 billion and anticipate consolidated segment operating profit margins to remain at 10.5%. Business area margins remained consistent with our prior guidance at Aero and MFC, while RMS is down about 50 basis points at the midpoint and space is up 40 basis points at the midpoint. The RMS reduction is driven by Sikorsky as the business faces continued cost pressure and absorption headwinds, the impact of which have exceeded benefits from its cost reduction programs. Conversely, space is benefiting from solid performance and proactive reduction efforts. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 11. We're increasing the midpoint by $0.35 to $26.35 with a range of $26.10 to $26.60 for the full year. Primary drivers of the change are shown on this chart with increases coming from incremental profit of $0.49 and other below-the-line items of $0.13. Partially offsetting those items are the RMS charges totaling $0.29 and from the severance actions and the asset write-downs taken in the second quarter. As Jim mentioned, we're encouraged by the F-35 delivery restart and continuous progress being made towards delivering full combat capability. We're holding our free cash flow expectation in the range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion, which absorbs a potential unfavorable impact from longer deferrals of final F-35 delivery payments. This is made possible by proactive actions taken across the company to offset these potential headwinds. On the cash deployment side, we still expect over $3 billion of IR&D and capital investments, while the dividend, along with the expected $4 billion of share repurchases, maintain attractive shareholder returns. Lastly, on backlog, we continue to expect backlog to grow in 2024 even with the higher sales outlook, which provides a line of sight to future growth. Before I wrap, I'd like to highlight a few other key assumptions regarding the updated outlook. First, we expect F-35 18/19 to be awarded this year, maintaining program funding and continuity. Second, we continue to expect $325 million of losses on the MFC classified program, of which $100 million has been recognized year-to-date. And third, this outlook does not assume any pension contributions in 2024. So in summary on Chart 12, our solid first half results give us confidence in raising the full year outlook for sales, profit and EPS, while holding the cash flow outlook, reflecting our ongoing efforts to deliver predictable, and improving operating and financial performance as is expected of us. It all starts with a relentless focus on executing to our programmatic commitments and delivering critical 21st Century security mission capabilities where we strive to continuously improve. To that end, we are investing in our people, processes and systems through the 1LMX transformation, with the goal of unlocking step changes in efficiency, velocity and program execution that delivers security capabilities in ahead of ready speed to our customers. And we're confident that these management priorities and actions convert to a compelling long-term value proposition for customers and shareholders alike. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: Hi, Jim, Jay and Maria. Release from Farnborough, the F-16 is flying in the background right now. So apologies for the grower in the background.
Jim Taiclet: Let's call it the sound of Freedom, Christine, it's good.
Kristine Liwag: I mean, it's a crazy or beautiful aircraft here. So the delivery guidance for the F-35 in the second half of this year is still fairly wide. Can you talk about the scenarios where there are lower and upper? What would have to happen for you to hit the lower upper end of the range? And also with production at 156 per year, when should deliver and production catch up for the program?
Jim Taiclet: So Kristine, I'll start and emphasize that we're going to do this unwind and conduct the deliveries with safety and quality is our number one priority. So just starting with that foundation, we actually have the ability to add resources, which have already been identified and designated. And that's test pilots, maintenance team, software and hardware engineers to get the flight test done that we need to, be at the higher end of that range. But we want to make sure that if it's weather, if it's pilot, crew rest issues, anything like that, we will accommodate for those. But we should -- we have the resources in place, I'll say, that should enable us to get to the higher end of that range, if you will.
Jay Malave: Yes. Let me just add, just to reiterate, Kristine, we expect anywhere between 75 to 110. Yes, with less than six months left, it is a wide range. I would say, over the next few months, we'll get much better insights into the induction and flow of aircraft going into the test and production cycle, really bringing in aircraft that are parked as well as aircraft that are coming outside of the -- from the production flow. And as we get those learnings, we'll be able to get a better assessment what the delivery requirements will be and what we expect for the year. And so it will take us a couple of months just to make sure we get that process learned out. It's well planned, but we actually have to demonstrate it in actual practice. As far as the future, from terms of reducing on the backlog of aircraft, our target is anywhere between 12 to 18 aircraft deliveries per month and really to burn down the aircraft backlog. And so that will take us a number of years here to get through that. We've already made progress so far. Since the announcement of the restart, we've delivered 10 aircraft as of Monday yesterday, six with the TR-3 configuration and four with the TR-2 configuration. So we think we're off to a very good start. But again, we really need to have a -- just to monitor the operating cadence of being able bring aircraft from two different flows into one test -- flight test flow. And again, we'll tighten that up later on in the year.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So I think you did say that next year, you're going to deliver more F-35s than you will produce. And I think at one point, you mentioned that you get paid $7 million upon each delivery. Walk us through -- you mentioned also the deferral of some payments. So next year, what happens to accrued revenues, because I think with higher deliveries, I assume the final delivery payment basically is incremental even though under POC, the work itself should be relatively level. And then secondly, the cash flow impact. I know that there's a deferral on the payments, but if it was really $7 million, that's potentially a substantial cash flow plus. Thanks so much.
Jay Malave : Okay. Cai, let me just say, first of all, as Jim mentioned, restarting delivery was an important first step really towards delivering the fully combat capable aircraft. Aircraft, the withhold -- the aircraft withhold this final delivery payment is a timing item, as you mentioned. And we're working with the customer to finalize the terms of those final delivery payments. We're making excellent progress, but it would be immature or premature to give details of that because it remains subject to negotiation. Suffice it to say that you will see timing benefit over the next few years as we deliver, but I think we still need to work through and finalize this agreement with the customer. As far as the revenue, I really wouldn't see -- expect much of an incremental benefit in terms of revenue. We continue to build at a 156 rate. We are seeing production a little bit higher this year. But for the most part, we should expect that to be, I think, fairly stable. And yes, we'll see incremental activity in terms of test activity, which does increase penetration on a percent complete basis. But I don't really view that being all that material. And so we just hold the production. We'll expect F-35 to grow mostly from sustainment next year and in the years to come. I think it's important to mention as well that we are -- the headwind on funnel delivery payments are here in 2024. We're holding our outlook, so we're absorbing that with better performance in the rest of the portfolio. Yes, we will see the timing benefits downstream. But as I mentioned before, we have to get just the whole delivery cadence straight. And I just want to make sure I had it straight in terms of the last question. We're targeting anywhere between 12 to 18 months to fully deliver on these parked aircraft. And as I mentioned, we just need to learn out the process over the next few months here and get -- to be able to give better guidance on that.
Cai von Rumohr: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Scott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Scott Deuschle: Jay, you've been seeing some nice momentum on revenue and now you're seeing some of it on margins as well. I guess at what point do you think you'll be ready to start talking about maybe a better medium-term free cash flow per share growth outlook in this mid-single-digit rate you've been talking about for a while. Do you just need to let these pension headwinds next year and see a bit more growth acceleration? And then you're there. Just curious for how you're thinking about that? thanks.
Jay Malave: Yes. No, I appreciate the question. We've said over the last few months and really the last year or so that our goal has been to increase absolute free cash flow in the low single-digit clip, and then that augmented with share repurchase would get us to a mid-single-digit free cash flow per share expectation. That remains of the outlook. We'll go through our multiyear forecast over the next few months here, we'll be able to give you a better update in the October timeframe. I think given the fact that we're at a higher level in 2024 is a positive, and we continue to expect to grow in 2025 off this higher baseline. So, that in and of itself should result in a higher cash flow baseline as well. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and then. And so I would like to have the benefit of going through that in more detail, and we'll update that to you at least preliminarily in October.
Scott Deuschle: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Gavin Parsons from UBS. Please go ahead.
Gavin Parsons: Thanks. Good morning.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Gavin Parsons: Maybe sticking on revenue. You guys have talked about supply chain kind of being a bottleneck, is the upside more on the demand front or on the unlocking of the supply chain side? And if latter, can you just talk a little bit more about supply chain and what you expect going forward in the second half, because I think the second half a lot less growth?
Jay Malave: Well, I'd say it's a combination of both. We ended the year in 2023 with a $160 billion backlog, which was a record. We ended here in the second quarter at $158 billion was slightly below where it ended a record with significantly higher sales than we thought through the first half of the year. We expect -- our continue -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we continue to expect the backlog to increase at end of this year, which gives us more visibility into further growth in 2025 and beyond. So, we're very bullish on where that stands from a backlog standpoint. As far as supply chain, we did see improvement. We are seeing continued improvement there and on-time delivery. The part shortages continue to come down. Having said that, there are still areas where we're -- particularly where we're ramping up some of our major programs where we still have some work to be done there. And we're still going through many of the initiatives and actions that -- proactive actions that we've talked about in the past, which is some in-sourcing on some capabilities, dual sourcing, where it makes sense. Also, we have deployed, and we continue to deploy personnel to provide on-site assistance at our suppliers. And of course, we also continue to look at product redesign. But I'd say, by and large, we are seeing an improvement in the in the supply chain, which also gives us confidence for that continued growth in the future.
Jim Taiclet: And Gavin, I just give you some qualitative background on demand side. Our strategy includes driving the latest digital technologies kind of through an open architecture, standard-based system to the DoD. And by doing that and making our product services platforms compliant or in line with those future concepts of open architecture and standards to pull through those products, services and platforms. So we're starting to see that already. And we're demonstrating whether it's exercises or in real conflict like the Red Sea, doing things like over-the-air updates to the AEGIS system, which is decades old, but it can be improved very quickly now just like when you download overnight on your Tesla, we can do a download overnight over the air on the AEGIS radar and combat control system and double, triple the effectiveness against things like low flying drones and cruise missiles. So we're actually implementing those kinds of things on a standard base architecture into our products and services today, which I expect will continue to pull them through.
Gavin Parsons: Great. Appreciate the detail.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, guys. Guys on missiles and fire control, if you think about what was appropriate in the 2024 baseline budget and the Ukraine supplemental, how much order flow is still to come there for you guys at MFC? And also, just if we think about the growth cadence there, you talked about $750 million a year in the past, you're going to be well above that this year. So I'm just wondering if that cadence is going to come back into play 2025 on a higher baseline. Thanks.
Jay Malave: Sure. I mean there's still plenty of runway in orders at MFC. As I mentioned, the book-to-bill in the quarter was above 2%, and we're still expecting additional orders at the end of the year, particularly in JASSM/LRASM in second half here. They're still even under supplemental, there's some opportunity there to continue to build their backlog and so we've talked about $750 million. You're right. They're going to be above that this year. We see continued growth there next year, and they're going to be, again, the highest grower within Lockheed Martin for the next three to five years. So we're pretty bullish on that. Much of that is already in the backlog, but there's still plenty more to come in terms of build -- continuing to build that backlog. The key for us is to make sure that we can meet the demand and ramp up all these programs to our customers' requirements. And the team has been laser-focused on making sure they can do that, and you're seeing the benefits of that this year with the sales coming in higher. So again, we keep our head down, continue to deliver. The demand is both domestic and international at MFC. And again, they're going to be a significant source of growth for Lockheed Martin or for the next three to five years.
Jim Taiclet: And Pete, it's Jim. Again, on a qualitative perspective, I tell our teams and our executives internally we're in the aerospace and defense industry, but we're in the deterrence business. right? So if you step back and say what contributes to deterrence from an MFC, for example? And I think anybody that's everyone watching Clint Eastwood would movie will know that, if we run out of ammunition, you're in a lot of trouble, right? So part of deterrence is showing that, a, you have enough ammunition stocks to prevail and sustain your operations from an aggressor. That's the first thing. Second thing is you also – it's helpful to demonstrate that you can produce at rate and ramp that rate quickly. That's our anti-fragility program. And the third piece of it is you can produce and repair MFC and other products in the local theater and not have to bring them all the way back to the US to fix them or drive that production up. That's the third part of our strategy. So everything we do is based on deterrents and strengthening that. And MSC has a huge role in making sure that adversaries know that we've got enough stocks in MFC type products, and we can ramp that rate and we can produce in different places and repair in different places should they act. And that's really kind of a qualitative underpinning of what Jay was talking about.
Pete Skibitski: Appreciate it guys.
Jim Taiclet: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hey. Thanks very much and good morning. Probably just a quick one. Sorry about the background noise here. Just a quick one and kind of big picture. I think, Jay, I think you've said in the past that there was good potential for growth to be at least as strong as 2024 and 2025 and good potential for that growth rate to accelerate. Is that still the case off of the higher revenue base and a higher growth rate here in 2025 -- in 2024?
Jay Malave: Yeah. It's a good question, Seth. And as I mentioned before, we're going -- just going through our process to lay out our multiyear outlook, including 2025 here over the next few months. What I would tell you is that the backlog visibility that we have would support another year similar to 2024. We have to have to go through though, and the operational. The practical operational capability to deliver that is something we go through. And so the demand is there. We have to make sure the supply can meet that as well. That's a pretty significant step change over really a two-year span on some of these ramp programs that we're dealing with. And as I mentioned before, we're still dealing with some programs that are still working through trying to get off to the ramp rates.
Operator: Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Maybe if we could talk about profitability. If we look at first half profitability of 10.7, second half implied in the low 10s. Can you walk through some of the moving pieces, maybe in terms of supply chain productivity, I know volumes are lower and how we think about the exit rate for the year?
Jay Malave: Yeah. The second half of the year, Sheila, is -- I mean the most significant would be the program loss at MFC that we have to record in the second half. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we recorded about $100 million here year-to-date. In the second half, we expect about another $225 million. So that will put pressure on margins in back half. The second piece I would say is that, we would have -- even though we had a very strong and solid profit adjustment first half that slows down a little bit in the back half of the year just based on program timing, the timing of risk retirements -- and so just the risk retirements and profit adjustments are not all linear, they incur different aspects of a program life cycle. But what I would say is we feel comfortable with where we're headed. We've talked about 2024 being a low watermark for all net-net margins, and we expect it to improve gradually over the next few years, and we still feel confident that can take place.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.
Jay Malave: All right.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ken Herbert: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to see and apologies if I missed this, but can you comment on your view of NGAD, and how you're thinking about that now moving forward? And what we might be thinking about in terms of the next catalyst for you on this particular program?
Jim Taiclet : Sure, Ken. It's Jim here. So when it comes to NGAD as a program, we're not authorized an industry to speak to the details of that. So you'd have go to the U.S. government to get insight into that particular program. But I can tell you what we're doing to prepare for the next-generation combat aircraft. So on the investment front, since 1920 -- or 2021 rather, we opened the gates on four high-tech facilities that have the clearance -- the security clearance capability to produce NGAD type components, let's call them, all right? One of them is in Florida, Skunk Works in California, opened a new major factory that I was there to see. We have it in Alabama, two in Georgia. So we have these accredited facilities up and running ahead of the demand, and we're working on programs and products in that classified capability space. So we've already got these facilities up and running. The other resource we have is human in Skunk Works, Marietta and in Fort Worth and other places that can design, test and build using our digital transformation engineering technologies and the digital twin these kind of components, aircraft and others that might go into a NGAD concept. So I can just tell you that Lockheed Martin is ready to produce. We're ready to design. We're ready to build. We are in the process of making sure we're capable in the arenas that the Air Force and the Navy are going to need us to be. So that's really all we can say about that. But I can assure you that we are competitive and ready to go in this space if and when the government pulls a trigger on a real competition and want somebody will be able to produce, we can do it.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Spingarn : Hey, good afternoon, or I guess, it's still morning. But I wanted to ask you about on F-35 and congrats on the resumption of deliveries. But when we think about TR-3 and on the production side of the equation, how is the supply chain in terms of being able to supply enough material and integrated core processors on time for you to maintain the 156 per year. So as the mix goes more toward all TR-3, how well prepared is the supply chain for that?
Jim Taiclet : So we got together, Rob, as I mentioned a few minutes ago in the prepared remarks in Fort Worth about a month with the CEOs of half of those companies that contribute to this in a significant way. We communicated the importance of exactly what you're speaking to which is not just a core processor, but there's a range and a number of other components across all of these companies that need to maintain or increase their production rates and modernize their equipment along the way. And so that communication of those suppliers has been made. They know our plans were well integrated -- more integrated than we ever have, I think, when it comes to test and planning and design iterative software across multiple companies, et cetera. So we're in a position, and as suppliers are telling us they will meet the demand. We will monitor them and continue to even put people in their sights when we need to, to make sure that happens. But we've got the major suppliers together, and they understand the demand rate, quality level we need and a better integration plan for test and development that we have built going forward.
Rob Spingarn: And Jim, just following on to that, how do we think about the cadence for retrofit from TR-2 to 3?
Jim Taiclet: So you're right, Rob, that this is designed for backward integration, if you will. There'll be a schedule that the US government. It comes up with for TR-3. There may be -- it will be up to them as to the cadence, the investment rate, et cetera. But over a period of time, there will be a great number of originally built TR-2 aircraft that will get converted. There's some hardware software upgrades to that.
Rob Spingarn: Is this the kind of thing you expect to be talking about soon? Or this is a few years out, we should be focusing on new production aircraft for now TR-3.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. So again, this is a US government policy decision, so it's better to request that kind of commentary from them, Rob. But we're, again, ready to do it at the rate that we expect -- that they come at us with.
Rob Spingarn: Great. Thanks, so much.
Jim Taiclet: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hey good morning everyone.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: Jay, could you give us the updated -- I guess, if you snap the line today or just ballpark as you see it, cash flow, pension contribution in CAS recovery for at least '25, and I guess if you had it, and we're willing to give it beyond that would be helpful. And then I guess, can you talk through the pieces of how you grow absolute dollar free cash flow in '25, given the pension headwind you have and how it compares to how quickly you can grow the segment EBIT.
Jay Malave: Yes. So on CAS recovery, this year, we're a little bit under, say, $1.7 billion. We expect that to step down by -- in the range of about $100 million and probably stay at that level for the next few years after that. As far as absolute free cash flow in terms of the buildup and components to being able to continue grow, yes, we've talked about pension being a headwind. We've talked about being in the range of about $1 billion. The areas that we expect to drive cash flow growth would be continued earnings growth as you discussed their net income growth, in addition to some of these benefits and the timing on the F-35. We've talked also about just working capital in general. And even when you put F-35 aside, what we're looking at and going after is our contract asset. If you look here in the second quarter, that was a nearly $14 billion balance that we had net represented in a range and I'll put that in terms of efficiency around 70, 72 days of sales running through the balance at the moment. Since 2020 or so, that's grown from about 55 days. So there's an element of there kind of the F-35 and what we've gone through over the past couple of years here, but there's also been growth outside of the F-35 that represents a lot of opportunity for us to convert into faster billings at a level that we've been we've been able to demonstrate in the past. And that's what focused with on all of the business areas in terms of driving that on a multiyear basis back down to what we've been able to demonstrate. The next thing I'll say, so besides working capital and contract assets that are biggest opportunity is the reduction of payments related to the tax R&D capitalization. So we'll get in the range, I'd say, about $150 million of benefit just through lower payments there. So when you bring all these things together, we think that they generate a path to overcome what we're seeing in the pension and drive us to this target of low single digit. It's not easy. It's not a slam dunk, but we've got a path to be able to do that, and that's what we're driving today to be able deliver next year and beyond.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, Jim, Jay. Maybe just for you on the -- just talking about -- you've talked a lot about MSC's production ramp that you're going to have over the next couple of years. Just how does this all tie in with the collaborative agreements you got with Ryan Mittal [ph] now, PAC-3 production opening up in Poland and I think Jim also mentioned Spain, an agreement there. Just can you give us an update on PAC-3, what the growth kind of expansion looks like now and same, I guess, on some high HIMARS and JASSM, what some of those growth rates look like? Thanks.
Jay Malave: Sure. A lot of these agreements enable -- they're part of in-country requirements for industrial cooperation. You mentioned Poland, you mentioned Germany, also Australia. And those are enablers for us to build up this backlog and drive this demand. On the PAC-3 specifically, we expect to get to $550 million in 2025, and then to $650 million by 2027. And so all of these orders and these partnerships that we're signing up, while all enablers to us to be able produce and deliver at those rates. And it's not just PAC-3. We've talked about GMLRS going from 10,000 to 14,000. We've talked about Javelin going from 2000 to about 4,000. We've talked JASSM and LRASM going from about 700 a year to 1,100 a year, so all of these orders that we're seeing, all these customer engagements that we have both domestic and international are all enablers to drive to these rates that we're building to. And so what they do is fill in the bucket to bring us to that backlog that's necessary for us to generate those sales. And we're on track to that.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi Research. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky: Good morning everybody. Jim, I wanted to just throw a big picture one at you, and maybe have you kind of wrap all of this together and kind of what you're seeing both in the near and in the long-term? And maybe just get your sense of maybe with a few more quarters here of hindsight, some of the lessons learned from the conflict in Ukraine. What you at Lockheed have learned from that whether you're investing in any new areas as a result of that? And kind of the feedback loop that you're getting from your customer both here in the United States, as well some of our allied nations as well. Are we seeing a development of a new set of requirements and investment areas kind of where are you spending and how are you going about doing it? Just a big picture, here we are middle of 2024, what have we learned from Ukraine? And what are we doing?
Jim Taiclet: So Jason, I would say that there's a wide range of lessons from the Ukraine conflict unfortunately, as it is, but there's learning from it. One is that traditional system, if you will, like Javelin, at the initial invasion, made a significant contribution to the initial defense of Ukraine because it was a classic armor attack and armor-supported infantry attack, meaning there were armored vehicles that were spearheading the drive to Kiev. And when those vehicles got out in front of their support system that the Javelin, for example, made a tremendous difference in stopping that attack short, right? So, you have a traditional system that was designed for land warfare -- traditional land warfare, if you will, that was highly effective. So, we did learn from that. Now, there's jamming both ways, electronic warfare, there's cyber and it's like I tell my teams like your high school wrestling coach that for every move, there's a counter move. So, if you jam GPS, we tweak the system, either the satellite or the receiver or have an alternative form of navigation or targeting, and we react to that. So, on one hand, traditional systems are still effective. On the other hand, you have to be able to adapt quickly. I'd say that was the main lesson there. Another one, similar situation, PAC-3, again, decades in service. And now there's a hypersonic missile threat from Russia, which was launched on a number of occasions. I think all those occasions, none of those missiles were successfully reaching their target because the PAC-3 was modified to be able to address the hypersonic missile threat. And then we'll go to the kind of the other side of the issue, which is, okay, drones became a more important element of land warfare than it had been before, -- and in sea warfare actually, Ukrainians to sea -- autonomous sea vehicles to significant extent and success and also drones and unmanned aerial vehicles, too. So, this is not the first time. Those kinds of systems have been used in prior conflicts, including in the Middle East and the counterterrorism wars, if you will. But the Ukrainians took it to a new level, literally sinking capital shifts with unmanned aerial systems. So, there are lessons there, too. That's something our company is quite involved with a lot of is classified, whether it's kinetic or surveillance, unmanned aerial systems, but we're learning from those too. So, we work with drones as smallest ones that a marine can unpack from a backpack and launch by hand to aircraft size drones, if you will. So, we're involved in that game, and we did take the lessons from the Ukraine war. And that's traditional systems are still essential at bulk and scale. And secondly, they have to be much more adaptable than they ever had to be before. And that kind of supports our digital technology effort and campaign to say, let's use those best digital technologies to make those legacy systems better and better and all the time not wait for a conflict to force us to do that.
Maria Ricciardone: Great. Hey Lois, I think we've come to the top of the hour. So, I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.
Jim Taiclet: Thanks Maria. So, before we close, I'd like to thank our Lockheed Martin team whose dedicated efforts to advance our customers' missions and propelled our solid results this quarter, as you heard from Jay. Our capabilities are recognized around the world as the best in defense tech. And that is thanks to our to our employees' hard work, dedication, and commitment to continued innovation. With 21st Century security technologies, I just described our robust backlog and focus on transforming our operations internal digital transformation program. Our company has a strong foundation for growth for years to come. So I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in October, and Lois that concludes our call for today.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to begin today's discussion with a brief overview of our quarterly financial results, the state of the U.S. Department of Defense budget, status updates on some key programs, and recent advancements made to support our vision of 21st Century security that integrates the latest digital technologies. Then Jay and Maria will provide more detailed information about quarterly highlights and financials. The increasingly unstable geopolitical environment in the world today makes it essential for industry and government to strengthen our nation's capabilities to deter and defend against further aggressive behavior against the U.S. and our allies. We here at Lockheed Martin are continuing to invest heavily to improve our design and production capabilities, while actively partnering with leading companies inside and outside the A&D industry to incorporate a wide range of technologies. As a result, we delivered robust revenue growth across the company, and we maintained a robust backlog of $159 billion, reflecting alignment between our advanced technology solutions and our customers' key missions and priorities. These first quarter results reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve the full year financial expectations we shared in the most recent earnings call. Moreover, the approved FY2024 defense budget reflected many positives for Lockheed Martin, consistent with national defense strategy priorities too. Highlights include robust funding for munitions multi-year procurement, continued investment in hypersonics and classified activities, and ongoing support for programs such as Black Hawk, CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, the fleet ballistic missile, C-130, and F-35. There were also additions to the original budget submission, including F-35 aircraft, C-130, and combat rescue helicopters. The initial budget request for FY2025, while still very early in the process, continues support of many of these same major programs, including the F-35, CH-53K, UH-60M and others. In addition to emphasis on advanced munitions programs such as JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, Javelin, Daimler, and PAC-3, as well as hypersonic conventional prompt strike and the long range hypersonic weapon. In addition to that, next-generation interceptor is getting support, which I'll address more in a moment. In this week, funding of $95 billion for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific security supplementals passed the House and is currently under consideration in the Senate. We expect FY2025 Presidential Budget request and additive supplemental funding will provide a strong underpinning for future growth over the next several years for our company, giving us further confidence in our long range plan. While demand for these key programs remains elevated, it is also essential that our program performance in terms of quality, safety, cost and schedule gets and stays at the highest level. On our most significant programs, I, Jay, and my senior executive team are personally and directly involved. On F-35, we remain focused on program execution in terms of concurrent development, production and sustainment, and we are bringing all relevant resources across our company and collaborating closely with our customers and suppliers to fully implement the TR-3 capabilities that everybody is looking forward to getting. These capabilities based on the new core processor, data storage unit, and pilot display will ensure that the F-35 is not only the most capable and effective fighter aircraft in the world, but it will also further advance its abilities to act as the air domain quarterback of joint all domain operations for the U.S. and its allies. We're encouraged by the solid progress made over the last few months towards resuming deliveries, including improvement in aircraft mission system capabilities and system stability as we advance from prior software versions towards a combat training capable configuration. Flight testing of this configuration is now underway and we're on a path we expect to be on with regard to maturing the system with approximately 95% of TR-3 capabilities in this flight test program. The test results to-date support our expected timeline of delivering the first TR-3 combat training capable aircraft in the third quarter and then transition to a fully combat capable aircraft in 2025. As planned, there will be continual software updates to support further capability insertions over the Block 4 program and beyond. While there were no final deliveries of F-35 jets in the first quarter, we're maintaining our production rate and continue to expect an aircraft delivery range for 2024 between 75 and 110, which requires timely receipt of the necessary hardware from TR-3 suppliers along the way. The F-35's advanced combat and interoperability capabilities continue to create strong demand for the aircraft internationally too. In the quarter, the Czech Republic became the 18th nation to join the F-35 global team with a signed letter of offer and acceptance, making it official its intent to procure 24 F-35s. In addition, the U.S. State Department approved a potential foreign military sale to Greece for up to 40 F-35s. And Singapore announced its intent to purchase eight F-35As to complement the 12 F-35Bs to which it has already previously committed. Also in the lower air domain, while we're disappointed in the cancellation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program or FARA, Sikorsky remains committed to delivering innovative and reliable aviation capabilities to our domestic and global customers. With a strong foundation of more than $20 billion in backlog, bolstered by expected and funded growth in the heavy lift CH-53K helicopter program, Sikorsky’s multi-year outlook is stable. We're also encouraged by the army's renewed commitment to Black Hawk production and modernization, as well as our ability to address mission gaps with capability upgrades that leverage Lockheed Martin's broad portfolio of solutions in the lower air domain, things such as autonomy, AI, et cetera. Turning now to missile defense missions, which given recent world events are becoming more critical than ever. We continue to lead the industry. Last week, the missile defense agency or MDA selected Lockheed Martin to deliver the new homeland missile defense capability for the United States, which is called the next-generation interceptor or NGI. As the MDA's NGI prime contractor, Lockheed Martin will provide the most modern, reliable and technically advanced interceptor in the history of this system. This program was a 1LMX that's our digital transformation worn digital program meaning we embrace model-based engineering, digital tools, processes and technologies from the very, very start of this program. Now, as it continues on its path to the critical design review, integration with broader weapons system and flight tests, I'm proud of the Lockheed Martin team that enabled all of this. We were MDA's early down select before it was even on their schedule because we're so far in front to get this essential homeland defense capability off to a fast start. Earlier this quarter, the Long Range Discrimination Radar or LRDR, completed final acceptance and was officially handed over to the Missile Defense Agency in preparation for an operational capability baseline decision. And what that means is final transition to active service for that radar to help defend the country. The LRDR is a cutting edge national asset providing the benefits of both low and high frequency radars to search, track, and discriminate incoming missiles with an open system approach, enabling the customer to add incremental capabilities such as hypersonic defense. This is located up in Alaska, in the prime location, where we can sense early what any attack might look like and respond to it. What that really does, though, is create an elevated deterrence to any kind of attack like that. So it's really great to have LRDR about ready to go online. Now, both NGI and LRDR will be critical elements within the overall homeland defense mission, and they're going to be integrated into the broader defense architecture with a battle management system that we call command control, battle management and communications, or as the military calls it, C2BMC. So that's the system that's going to be used to integrate the radars, the missiles, and allow us to defend the country. In April, Lockheed Martin was selected for a potential 10-year, $4 billion follow-on C2BMC next-generation contract with the MDA, demonstrating again our leadership position and battle management systems for homeland defense. Under this contract, we'll continue to modernize and expand the system's capabilities to enhance global integration, improve space domain awareness, and optimize sensor connectivity and data fusion to levels never done before. All of which will create the most complete picture of these incoming threats as I just spoke about a minute ago. Separately, we also continue to advance our 21st Century security solution through collaboration with strategic commercial partners across the tech, telecom, microprocessor, and other industries to support the national defense. Citing just one example, we announced Lockheed Martin will work with Intel to support the simulated transition for Advanced Microelectronics Packaging or STAMP program for the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. This CHIPS Act related collaboration will provide a revolutionary leap in defense systems capabilities using high performance U.S. built semiconductors. Over the next 18 months, we'll integrate our latest sensor open system architecture technology with Intel semiconductors with the intent to ultimately implement, test and complete production through the U.S. Navy's Lockheed Martin MH-60 Romeo helicopter program. I'll now turn it over to Jay for more highlights and some additional commentary on our financial results. Jay?
Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim. I'll cover the consolidated results and touch on some additional highlights before handing it off to Maria, who will discuss the quarterly financials by business area, and then I'll come back to discuss the outlook and close out the remarks. Starting with chart four, we had a strong start to the year. First quarter sales of $17.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year, led by MFC and RMS. While the results benefited from an extra calendar week compared to 2023, normalized year-over-year sales growth was a solid 5%. We saw strong labor and material throughput indicative of an improving supply chain. We'll continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to enhance quality and performance proactively and, as needed, expand the breadth and depth of our engagement at supplier locations. Segment operating profit of $1.7 billion was up 4% year-over-year with margins of 10.1%, and included the anticipated $100 million reach-forward loss associated with the classified missile program at MFC. Excluding this charge, Lockheed Martin segment margins were 10.7%, primarily reflecting year-over-year lower profit adjustments. GAAP earnings per share of $6.39 were down 3% as year-over-year benefits from higher profit and lower share count were more than offset by higher interest expense, lower pension income, and mark-to-market gains. Book-to-bill in the first quarter was just below one. Notably, space booked several large national security orders in the quarter, including SDA tracking layer and other significant classified awards, contributing to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.8 and record backlog of $33 billion at space. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter after investing $360 million in research and development and $380 million in capital expenditures. Share repurchases were $1 billion and we returned $780 million through our dividend. Shifting over to additional highlights in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress we are making on the F-16 program. The first three F-16 Block 70 jets varied from Greenville, South Carolina to Bahrain in March. To-date, Lockheed Martin has produced five F-16 Block 70 jets for Bahrain with additional 11 in various stages of production and testing. We also presented the first two F-16 Block 70 aircraft to Slovakia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, underscoring the deepening partnership between the two countries. In addition, the State Department notified Congress of authorization of the sale of 40 F-16s and related upgrades and support to Turkey. The latest deal builds on our long relationship and history with the Turkish Air Force. We are confident the F-16 Block 70 and Viper upgrade package provide advanced 21st Century security capabilities with affordable operating and lifecycle costs for Turkey. We also continue to upgrade our weapon systems for longer range standoff capability. In February in the U.S., the extended range ER variant of GMLRS guided multiple launch rocket system achieved success in its first operational test. The U.S. army fired two unitary warhead ER GMLRS variants with a HIMARS launcher, demonstrating precision and advancing this capability closer to production. The U.S. army almost awarded Lockheed Martin the fourth production contract for early operating capability precision strike missiles known as PrSM. This award will allow for a significant increase in production quantities to meet army demand for long range surface missiles. And the hypersonics, following the recent end-to-end flight test, we completed the test program of the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon or ARRW with full confidence in its revolutionary capabilities. We have demonstrated successful all up round end-to-end performance on multiple occasions. ARRW provides the U.S. with the earliest air launch fully qualified production ready supersonic solution -- hypersonic solution, I'm sorry. And Lockheed Martin is prepared to quickly deliver additional tactical, operational and leave behind hypersonic strike assets that can be rapidly deployed to the U.S. military. We also continue to advance hypersonic strike capability in the land and sea domains through the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon and Conventional Prompt Strike programs. Both solutions have a full year milestones ahead as we progress towards operational capability. Shifting the integrated air and missile defense arena the AEGIS Weapon System successfully executed one of the most complicated ballistic missile defense tests in the first quarter. When the system tracked and intercepted a medium range ballistic missile amidst multiple decoys. The test employed the latest updates to the system and demonstrates the reliability of AEGIS to operate in a dynamic threat environment and we're constantly evolving the AEGIS system. This quarter, we made further progress on our efforts to integrate with PAC-3 to enable an affordable, combat proven IAMD capability for maritime engagements and expand the mission capability of our systems. I'll pause here and let me turn it over to Maria to cover the business areas.
Maria Ricciardone: Okay. Thanks, Jay. Today, I will discuss first quarter year-over-year results for the business areas. Starting with aeronautics on chart five. First quarter sales at Aero were over $6.8 billion up 9% year-over-year, and that's 1% normalized for the extra week in 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes across F-35 and Skunk Works and the continued production ramp on the F-16 program. Segment operating profit is comparable year-over-year with higher volume being offset by lower margin development contract mix and lower net profit adjustments, mainly on the F-35. Aeronautics backlog remains at a healthy $57 billion, which includes 373 F-35s and 80 C-130Js, and 132 F-16s, supporting growth into 2025 and beyond. Turning to Missiles and Fire Control on Chart 6, sales increased 25% from the prior year, 16% normalized for the extra week driven by production ramps on tactical and strike missile programs, primarily GMLRS, HIMARS and JASSM, LRASM. Integrated air and missile defense also saw higher volume on PAC-3 and THAAD. As expected, segment operating profit decreased 18% year-over-year, primarily due to the $100 million loss on the classified program Jay mentioned previously. Normalizing for the loss, MFC's margins would have been 13.7%. Now, I'd like to provide a quick update on our annual production capacity plans for key programs. PAC-3 is currently at 500 missiles, growing to 550 in 2025, and 650 by 2027. GMLRS currently is at 10,000 missiles, growing to 14,000 by 2025. JASSM, LRASM currently at about 650 missiles, growing to 1,100 by 2026, and HIMARS currently at 72 launchers, growing to 96 next year. Shifting to rotary emission systems on Chart 7. Sales increased 16% in the quarter, 8% normalized for the extra week, driven by higher volume across the entire portfolio, including radar and laser programs within integrated warfare systems and sensors, various programs within C6ISR and the CH-53K and Seahawk programs within Sikorsky. Operating profit increased 23% due to higher volume and favorable contract mix, partially offset by lower profit adjustments. Finally, with space on Chart 8, sales increased 10% year-over-year, 2% normalized for the extra week to approximately $3.3 billion. The growth was driven by higher volume on the fleet ballistic missile program and ramp ups on hypersonic and next-generation interceptor programs within strategic and missile defense, as well as higher volume on space development agency transport and tracking layer programs within national security space. Operating profit increased 16% compared to Q1 2023, driven by higher volume and ULA equity earnings, partially offset by lower net profit adjustments, primarily on the Next-Gen OPIR program. Now, I'll turn it back to Jay to wrap up our prepared remarks.
Jay Malave: Thanks, Maria. Let's turn to the outlook on Chart 9. Our expectations for Lockheed Martin’s 2024 financial outlook remain unchanged from what we said in January. With the strong first quarter results positioning us well to achieve the consolidated full year outlook, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion, including over $3 billion of independent research and development and capital investments. While the dividend, along with the expected $4 billion of share repurchases, support our returns to shareholders, targeting a mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth over the longer-term. All right. To close out and summarize on Chart 10, we're off to a solid start in 2024 and remain laser-focused on execution to our customer and programmatic commitments while building momentum towards delivering our full year guidance. Through our 1LMX transformation, we are reengineering our internal processes by providing the automations and capabilities needed to drive efficiency, increase velocity and enhance key captures and programs. 1LMX will enable us to combine the depth and breadth of our portfolio with the expertise and dedication of our people to drive 21st Century Security solutions for our customers and continue to create value for our shareholders. With that Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: I'd like to start to make sure we have a good understanding of the F-35 right now with TR-3. As you said, the Air Force has talked about this as well, and it looks like that timeline has moved back to some point in Q3. And there's just been a great deal of slippage in the timeline over the last few years. Block 4 has been delayed, and the new budget has cut deliveries in 2025 and 2026, ostensibly to avoid having to do later Block 4 upgrades. Now, you've been able to keep production and revenues up, although deliveries and cash payments are off. But how can we get confident in the trajectory? And perhaps, Jim, maybe you could talk about what a positive or more negative scenario might look like for production and deliveries over the next two years? And what it would mean for the revenue and cash trajectory?
Jim Taiclet: Sure, Doug. So I think it's important to understand that we're doing, as I said earlier, concurrent development and production and then advancing the sustainment capability as well, all at the same time. Most of these complex programs go through a period of development and then a production run largely off of that design base or that engineered base of what the aircraft supposed to look like and how it's going to perform. The F-35 is different in a sense that development has been going on since the day the program started years and years ago, and it's going on today. Now, the good news about that is you have step function increases in capability every few years, and as a result of the F-35's capacity to do that, the government just came out and extended the expected service life of the aircraft another decade or two, I think it was. So this is a good thing, but it's also an extremely difficult thing to do and even to predict schedule, right? It's our responsibility to hold cost and schedule, but we're -- we don't control all the variables let me just say. And that's okay, we're still the OEM, we're still responsible. And so what we run into on TR-3 is just a level of complexity and executing the step function increase, that's pretty, I'd say, novel or dramatic. What the team is doing at our company is we're integrating a series of components, devices, software, and managing and integrating all of that. And so what's happening now is we are ringing out all of the software through all of the new hardware and integrating it into all the aircraft other systems. And that's taken longer than our team predicted. The way we're going to get at that is if you think of it as a release one and a release two, and we've got a lot of confidence in this stage. So release one, if you think of it that way is what we're calling along with the U.S. government, a combat training capable aircraft, meaning we can get these jets in the hands of squadron, wing, and regional commanders so that they can start training their pilots on them and training their maintenance organizations and also getting their bases and infrastructure, spare parts, pools and everything else sort of in operational shape, if you will. Once we get the final software load for the fully combat capable version of TR-3, sometime in the next few months, then those aircraft could be deployed into actual combat operations and you'll have the training, the maintenance, the ringing out, the operational patterns and procedures on how to actually fly the jet in combat. So we'd like to be able to do it sooner, but this is the schedule we're on. And I'd say for the combat training cable aircraft, we're highly confident, based on the test results so far, that those will be deliverable in the third quarter. Jay, you want to say anything else about cash flow and --
Jay Malave: Yes, sure. Doug, I'll just add, as Jim mentioned, this combat training capable -- capability and configuration, as Jim mentioned, supports the training of the squadrons standing up to new squadrons and decreasing the amount of time of the aircraft are parked. All that, what that does is really avoids any type of significant disruption. And so what this does is really keep our production on track here in 2024 and then beyond as well. As Jim mentioned, in 2025, we'll have further capability inserted and we'll actually start delivering on the inserting Block 4 type of capability as well. And you may have heard, you referenced comments made from the U.S. military and they discussed a Block 4 reimagined, and what that would entail is an insertion schedule that's really tied to an executable plan that can be provided by industry, so we can avoid these types of disruptions. And so when you look at it in the short-term, could there be pressure on the last 15 through 17 contract profitability and potential movement around in cash flow? Yes. But I think over the longer-term and the medium-term, I think we're working in coordination with our customer to make sure that we can deliver the capabilities the customer wants, but on an executable schedule. And if we're able to do that, then we should be able to keep the program on track from a production standpoint.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. I'm sorry, David. Okay, great.
David Strauss: Good morning. Yes, thanks.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning, David.
David Strauss: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So since Q4, we have a 2024 budget, looks like we're going to get a very large supplemental. You won NGI. How might all those things together change how you're thinking about where you kind of fall in, in the revenue guide this year and the potential for revenue growth in 2025 to accelerate kind of off this low-single-digit level?
Jim Taiclet: So David, as we mentioned, for this quarter, we started off pretty solid, just on an apples-to-apples basis 5% growth in the first quarter lines up pretty well with a mid-point guidance range, which is 2% to 2.5% and the high end of that range being, say, around 3.5%. So we're well-positioned to deliver on that expectation. It is possible somewhere to last year that we could see some upside towards the higher end of the sales guide range there. So again really good start that enables that. As we think about 2025, what you saw in the budget, what we're seeing here in supplemental, give us higher confidence that we'll continue to grow. We talked about growth in -- starting in 2023, a year earlier than we had originally anticipated, accelerating in 2024, and then giving us more confidence that we'll see at least a same if not more growth in 2025. We'll give you -- it later in the year, we'll give you a much better update in terms of what we're seeing. But right now all this bodes well to our sustained growth in terms of what we've been driving to, not only in 2025, but beyond 2025 as well.
Operator: And the next question is from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: On missiles from fire control, can you talk maybe about the confidence in your margins -- margin guidance for the year? Just given the 1Q margin performance was certainly the lowest that we've seen in many years. And we know the classified losses are supposed to expect it to continue, but you've got kind of this reflecting top-line. I think Maria called out all the production increases and just do the losses just get smaller on the class side, or are we going to see some offsets just because of the higher volume? Maybe you just give more color on kind of your expectations on the margin performance profile going forward. Thanks.
Jay Malave: Sure. Peter, MFC was a little light because of two factors. First, as we mentioned, we did have the $100 million loss provision that we recorded. In addition to that, their profit adjustments were lighter year-over-year by about $20 million. And so that's a function really of calendarization. We'll see profit adjustments in throughout the rest of the year improve. And so getting us back to what we had guided to. Just as a reminder, we're anticipating, and that was fully anticipated in our guidance for MFC, that we would have additional or could have additional losses in the back half of the year associated with this classified program. And so what our guide, what it implies from where we are today, we reported $100 million is in a range of another $225 million in the back half of the year, which would be provided for in this expectation. Now, going beyond that, we've talked about this, and I'll just deal with the question upfront in terms of can timing change? And it's possible that we could record additional losses here in 2024 depending on other factors as the year goes on, there's factors such as technical milestone achievement through the balance of the year, discussions with our customers, visibility to funding. So all of those factors go into the determination and whether you have to recognize a loss earlier. You'll see coming out in our 10-Q that we've actually ranged the potential losses on this program, which would be in excess, additional losses in excess of $1 billion. So at least you could have an opportunity to size it. The timing of which is still to be determined. We've got about $225 million at least embedded in our guide for the balance of the year. Going back to MFC for the year, if you really take apart their expectation, the impact of this at $325 million of losses in the year anticipated, they're offsetting a fair amount of that in their guide. I mean, the impact of that is 270 basis points alone. And their total full year guide is down about 210. And so you're seeing offsetting improvement within MFC, it's not entirely one-for-one, but their underlying performance has been solid and we expect that to continue.
Jim Taiclet: And Peter, it's Jim. I used to fly these aircraft for the USAF and I can assure you that the capability that's being developed here at MFC in the classified program will have very, very long legs. There's going to be many, many years, we believe, of orders to follow. So, yes, for a quarter, for the year, maybe for a couple of years, we're going to absorb the loss provisions that Jay described. But I think if you look under the curve for the lifecycle is going to be significantly positive. And so we want to get there as efficiently as we can. This is a long run franchise program that I think the U.S. government is going to support for a very long time.
Jay Malave: Right. I think it's important to keep that in mind that, we spend a lot of time talking about timing of losses and things like that and the magnitude of it, but we also spend a lot of time internally going through just where we are in the progress of the program as well as the business case. And I can assure you the business case is accretive to it at a above our cost of capital. And as Jim mentioned, it's going to provide strong returns for many years to come.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Matt Akers: Yes. Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the question.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Matt Akers: I want to ask a couple on the Next-Gen Interceptor win, I guess one just how you were able to win. I think ahead of when the original down flight was expected and also whenever there's sort of a big contract like this, and we always get questions on potential charges because we've seen some of that happen in the industry. So just your confidence that you've got the cost there sort of size correctly.
Jim Taiclet: So the company made a beta about three years ago to say, okay, we've got a digital transformation program that is going to take the whole company to this model-based engineering system. And that's all the way from requirements acceptance from the government to sustainment years and years down the road. And we spoke this before; it's about a $6 billion, 8 to 10-year program to convert the entire company to a model-based engineering production sustainment operation. NGI was one of the pathfinder programs picked to implement this because there's no legacy to convert, right. There's no old blueprints to try to figure out how to make three dimensional, which is something, by the way, we are doing for C-130 and other programs right now. But we could get off to the fast start on NGI because it was in this born digital category. Right from the proposal, we were using these digital technologies, 3D, CAD and everything else, and sharing data with the government in that fashion, and they were able to receive it. And we could thereby accelerate the schedule and contain the cost of the development and ultimately of the production too, by using these tools. There were three original players in this. One dropped out fairly early. The second was in kind of this final phase, if you will, of down select. And we were -- we just ready to go and provided our proposal ahead of schedule. The other player, to my knowledge, provided a proposal also. And then the government was able to make a decision based on that. But I think because of our speed and our ability to demonstrate manageable cost over time, we won, and kind of won early, if you will. I'll let Jay talk more about financials, but what I can assure you is the process of this bid did not require us to dive to the bottom on cost. So Jay, do you want to take it from there?
Jay Malave: Sure. Just a -- we're currently performing already under a contract, and that contract will continue. We've talked about this before. We've completed a preliminary design review in September of 2023. And we're on track for critical design review in 2025 and under the current contract as well as building test assets. So that will just continue under this down select. As far as pricing and costs, the current contract, because of development contracts, cost plus contract, it's low margin as you would expect, but nothing again abnormal. As far as future bidding that we provided for future types of contracts, there were various elements or different types of contract structures that the customer asked for. We provided those to the customer, none of which was based on aggressive pricing or bidding, as Jim mentioned. We've talked about this in the past, and we've taken a middle-of-the-road approach to our pricing, and this is no different.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: With FARA off the table, and it looks like the flyer program has decent support, how are you thinking about the outlook for the vertical lift business? Where could we see some upside? What other competitions are out there? And how should we think about that?
Jim Taiclet: Yes. So Ron, this is Jim here. As we kind of roll into the 21st Century, what our company is trying to do is not just look at things through the programmatic lens or I'll call it vertical kind of column but also horizontally through the actual mission and figure out what technologies can accomplish the mission that will enable our core basic platforms to be successful as well. And that's how we're looking at the rotary business. It's not just at Sikorsky anymore. It is Sikorsky plus all of Lockheed Martin, right? And that's one of the reasons we're able to work with U.S. Army, Congress and the broader U.S. government to increase support for, let's say, Black Hawk, for example, in spite of the fact that FARA is being canceled and there's another vertical lift program in the form of FLRAA, which is going to be a tilt rotor. So there are missions that the Black Hawk will be extremely well suited for in the rotary lower -- it's really the lower air domain. It's not just for rotorcraft. So how do we pair those rotorcraft, a traditional Black Hawk, let's call it, by modernizing the Black Hawk with digital technology to do what the Air Force would call CCA, collaborative combat aircraft, meaning you can in the lower air domain tie drones and unmanned, uncrewed aircraft to a Black Hawk using digital technology, and we've demonstrated that already. You can actually make the Black Hawk itself autonomous with no pilots in it being flown from a command center to do high-risk missions. So we're looking at the mission and saying, what can we do all across Lockheed Martin, whether it's through sensor fusion, AI, 5G, space-based sensor assets to make the Black Hawk, for example, a much longer lived platform, a much more relevant platform and actually a very efficient platform compared to, say, the FARA aircraft that won't be able to do some of the missions anyway. So we have a strong confidence then in Sikorsky itself and the platforms that it does produce. And that includes CH-53K, which I mentioned the Seahawk, which is a Black Hawk that's configured for maritime operations that is pretty high tech as well. And so we feel really solid, as I think Jay said in his remarks, on Sikorsky's future with a backlog of $20 billion and the ability to modernize these really reliable in production aircraft to do new things and with missions in digital technology and other -- and integrate with other parts of LM and our partners to make those platforms relevant in the future. So I'll stop there. Jay, you have anything else you want to say?
Jay Malave: Sure. Just a couple of things, as Jim mentioned. A stable outlook is the best way to describe it. As Jim mentioned, CH-53K is really the pillar. And those revenues between now and 2027 and 2028 are going to double. And so while we will see declines in other programs such as combat rescue helicopter, some declines on Black Hawk and others, the CH-53K will really offset all of those declines. We do have to go through a rebalance, a little bit of a rebalance of the workforce because the mix of development work versus production work is different than what we had originally anticipated. So we'll go through that. But I think the business, as I mentioned, will be -- is pretty stable. We're also, as Jim mentioned, continue to have dialogue and just investments in Black Hawk modernization, which will maintain its relevancy particularly in the JADC2 environment. And so, of course, you continue to see opportunities for not only the base missions that Black Hawk performs but other missions as well. Those dialogues are ongoing with the army to determine what would be the best fit for those. And so as I mentioned, from a revenue standpoint over the next five years, it will actually go up over the next few years a little bit, come back down, but pretty much flat to where it is today. And so stability, I think, is the best way to describe it.
Operator: The next question is from Rob Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Spingarn: If we put the impact of TR-3 to the side, on the last call, you underscored the importance of the supply chain in producing F-35s at a rate of 156. And one of the things that's made the F-35 program so well supported by Congress and international countries is the breadth of the supply chain. But is the complexity and scale of the supply chain limiting the potential and affordability of the program? And on future fighter aircraft programs, whether it be NGAT or FAXX, might we expect Lockheed to do more of the work in-house, the production work in-house when compared to F-35?
Jim Taiclet: So it's a great topic, Rob. And so let's start with the origination of the F-35 program. It was intended, as you said, to be a wide-based Allied program. I think it was seven literally partners, essentially treaty partners that we all get together and contribute their industrial capacity and their financial capacity to this program, given its importance and complexity and the scale that people are contemplating. So yes, we have a pretty broad supply chain. There were a couple of times when that's gotten a little tough for the program. COVID was one of those. So we had delayed deliveries out of the UK, because the factories there weren't open, although ours were. So we will be mitigating any future programs that we have. And we're eager to have international production and sustainment partners, and we're going to expand that. But we're also going to apply some anti-fragility methodologies to those initiatives going forward. No one really thought of COVID, of course. But now that we've had that example, we need to know -- we know we need to have second and maybe third sources. And geographic diversity would be a positive thing from that perspective. So we'll just be a little more broadly thoughtful about how we do this. Having single sources outside the U.S. is probably not the best idea. There's an affordability issue around that too. So we're just going to have to balance everything out. So based on its origination and essentially the commitment of the countries to the program, we do have that sort of spread out supply chain with a couple of weak spots in it. Look, another weak spot's canopies, right? How hard is it to make a glass canopy? Well, with this kind of stress and the kind of precision that's needed and put in an F-35 canopy together versus an F-4, which I used to look out a little bit. Highly complex, hard to produce, single source, one of the big degraders that we have. So again, we're going to learn from that, whether it's a domestic or an international supplier going forward. In addition, as you pointed out, we are heavily in-sourcing when we can, and Lockheed Martin has the best technology. We're looking hard at making sure that we can control as much of the supply chain that is feasible and reasonable based on whatever program it is. And so, for example, on NGI, that was at MFC, Lockheed Martin Space collaboration to make sure that the most critical sensor components that we could produce in the company effectively and efficiently were the ones that were selected, okay? And so your topic is a really great one. We intend to actually geographically further diversify our supply chain but really based on this anti-fragility concept of having two or three sources, either different parts of the world, different companies, different logistical chains, things like that where we won't run into some supply chain issues as much as we have on some prior programs, including F-35, honestly, so.
Operator: Next question is from Rob Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Jim, last quarter, you had some comments on contract structures and the way perhaps your customers have been dealing with defense industry in recent years. I was wondering if there's been any sort of resonance from your commentary and any willingness, early willingness from the customer to look at this in a fresh way.
Jim Taiclet: So let me focus on digital service contracting because I think that's a really ripe opportunity area for the DoD to work with industry, not just the traditional defense fronts, if you will, but broader industry too. We want to play on subscription basis ourselves. We want to bring in partners that will only be our suppliers on a subscription basis. So in terms of, say, 5G, connectivity services, backhaul, those kinds of things, AI, which needs constant refreshing and modeling. We will do a lot of the AI in-house, but we're not going to be possible to do all of it. We want to bring in partners. We announced a couple of them like NVIDIA and IBM. They want to work with us. So I do think we're starting to get interest inside government on how to do this. We proposed, frankly, ourselves, which will open up opportunity for a lot of other companies in different sectors an adjacent acquisition process within the DoD for digital services alongside the traditional DoD acquisition process for largely physical goods like aircraft, ships, et cetera. There's interest in that. We haven't gotten it over the line, so to speak. But I think there's a lot of advocacy across broad industry to do that and starting to be in Congress and other places in DoD as well. Along with that, we want to drive an open architecture system so that U.S. government has a lot of diversity in its potential suppliers because we're all working off of the same standards base as far as APIs, interfaces, frequencies, use and those kinds of things and synchronize that as much as we can with commercial industry so we can use more of their IP and more of their resources and more of their people. So I think that there's a lot of opportunity here, and we're getting -- starting to get some traction on it. But it's going to take a little bit of time to get those processes and those standards bodies put in place. But we're actually on it, and we have some partners and teammates agree with those.
Jay Malave: I'll just add, Rob, we have seen some changes where the contract structure is more closely aligned with the capability that's being requested and the assessment of the technology maturation of that capability. And so you're not seeing as many of these kind of high-risk fixed-price development contracts that really don't work well for anybody because they don't optimize a solution, and they typically end up poorly for the contractor. And so we have seen those changes. Again, they're case-by-case. But I can tell you that at least what we're seeing, particularly in the higher risk, higher technology-type risk arenas, we are seeing a shift in contracting to contracting vehicles that are just more relevant to those circumstances.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. And Rob, maybe to support just another minute what Jay is speaking about in a more direct way here. I have a view, as you may have heard, that having a -- even a cost-based development project or program with a fixed price set of early production options is a tough thing to intellectually get at least my arms around, which is committing to cost and price on an object that really hasn't been fully invented yet. And we're looking really, really hard if that's -- in any opportunity that's presented to us in that context as a company. So that is one area where to, again, highlight what Jay is speaking about, more of an alignment of what can industry deliver on a reasonable risk basis. And so the government can get a successful program out of it, frankly, and not have massive write-offs in industry or cost overruns or long schedule delays. We think it's constructive to get some more of that alignment that Jay described.
Operator: Our next question is from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Good morning. A couple of quick one's for you, Jay. If the first quarter normalized growth was 5%, and even at the high end, you're looking for 3.5%. So will this be the fastest-growing quarter? And what slows down and obviously normalizing for the fourth quarter? And then, the second question is the guide for other net was $400 million. First quarter is only negative 61. So I was expecting you might lower that number for the year. And so what was the reason why you didn't lower it? Thanks.
Jim Taiclet: Jay?
Jay Malave: All right, George. Thank you. On the quarterly profile for sales, as you mentioned, on a normalized basis, 5% growth here in the first quarter. I'd see it will slow down to low-single-digit in the second and third. And we're thinking that the fourth quarter probably flattish to maybe slightly down. You might recall that the fourth quarter of 2023 ended up being stronger than we were originally expecting. And so our compare in the fourth quarter of this year would be a little bit tougher. And so you're talking in second and third quarters probably 2% to 3% type of growth numbers with a flattish year-over-year in the fourth quarter. As far as other net, George, you got me there. There's probably some opportunity in there. We'll calibrate that, and we'll update the guide in the second quarter for the full year. But it's probably more prudent to just wait till we're halfway through the year and just make an assessment of the entire outlook, and we'll just leave it there.
Operator: And our next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: You talked about Pentagon terms of trade and contract structure here, and you mentioned NGI as cost plus development. But you also mentioned they asked for -- to kind of see multiple contract structures. Curious what they asked to see, where you landed on those maybe interim windows between development and production. And then, Jay, the loss-making classified program in MFC, what year do you expect that to be profitable on an annual basis? And just to confirm, there's one program in that position, correct, not more than one?
Jay Malave: Yes, that's correct, Noah, just one program. And I think right now, our outlook would say probably in -- if you're -- probably 2028 is where we would expect that to flip to positive. Again, it's a question of the timing of the recognition of the losses, but if you assume kind of more linear approach from here on out to be about 2028. As far as NGI, just again, the different contracting vehicles are ranging anywhere from cost plus to fixed price incentive. There is no -- the customer hasn't selected exactly which vehicle wants to pursue. So there's nothing actually under contract for the next phase or phases. Right now, we're going to continue to perform under the current contract, as I mentioned. We got critical design review in 2025. We also, as part of this contract, we have to provide some test assets. And between now and then, I'm sure we'll have discussions in terms of getting future phases on contract.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. And Noah, the principle behind what Jay and I are speaking to here is that we want to be agnostic ultimately from a risk-adjusted basis on whatever contract format that the government would like to employ in these matters. So if it's going to be any kind of, I'll say, a highest risk would be again, fixed price production on something that's not been designed yet. We will put a high risk premium in the future and have on those kinds of requests of the government. And what's interesting is they're asking for multiple types on NGI. And that's going to give them an opportunity to see what contract risk transfer to industry is now going to cost, at least in Lockheed Martin's case because we will reply on that basis to say, if you want us to have this kind of contract, we have to have a risk premium that's significantly higher than, let's just say, a pure cost-based contract to give you the greatest contrast. And that's just the principle we're going to use from now on. So if you want a certain price point as government, we will provide you a contract format that will get you that price. But if you want to shift more risk to industry, you'll see a higher risk premium come back in our proposal, if you will. So that's the principle we're using and that we'll continue to use.
Maria Ricciardone: Lois, I think we have time for one more question since we're close to the top of the hour. So let's take one more, and then we'll be done.
Operator: Thank you. And next question will come from Rich Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Rich Safran: Good morning, thanks. Two-part -- quick two-part question on C2BMC. I want to know if you could discuss the P&L impact in terms of timing and margins. Second and more broadly, I thought you might discuss a bit about how this fits with the -- with your strategy for pulling in mission-centric programs and what the opportunity set there is?
Jay Malave: Okay. For timing, we're -- we've been under contract. This is a follow-on for us. And what I could do, Rich is I don't recall off-hand exactly what the annual revenues are, but I got Maria follow-up on you. But this is, again, just a continuation of those activities there. And so no significant change I don't think from a revenue standpoint or margin expectation at RMS for this.
Jim Taiclet: And so from the mission-centric approach, this is actually a pretty good example of that, Rich, in pulling through or extending existing programs, right? And so we're trying to show is that you can map data flows through a full mission, right, which generally includes and now cyber, by the way, upfront. So you have a cyber-track, then you have to have a sensing capability. You then have to have a way to get sensor data, whether it comes from a satellite or a submarine back into the command and control system. Along with that, you have to have targeting and tracking quality data that comes from beyond just the sensing of an object that's a target. You have to be able to track the target in a way that you can then guide a projectile to it and take it out or put a cyber-attack against it or laser or whatever the effector will be. And so the term of art for that is not pretty. It's called a kill chain. We want to put these chains together in diverse ways that are, again, anti-fragile, which means if you take out one link in that chain, you don't eliminate your ability to complete the mission. And so that's where we're looking at data flows in addition to physical flows, if you will, right? And if we can help create an open architecture system that can provide multiple routes of data flows that can affect missions, then we will be able to have a head start on our platforms and designing to those. And that's what we're doing with Black Hawk for example. That's what we're doing using the C2BMC system. The LRDR radar and ultimately, the NGI missile will be based on a similar architecture. We'd like that architecture to be common outside of Lockheed Martin as well as inside because that will open up more suppliers to us and also provide the government more competitive options. So this is all coming together, and I'm kind of glad you asked the question here at the end because it's very intentional.
Jim Taiclet: Okay. Thanks, Maria. Thanks, everybody, on the call. I want to also express my appreciation to everybody at Lockheed Martin for their relentless focus on this operational execution I mentioned, driving innovation and excellence. And we're all doing this in support of our customers. That's the reason. We have a vision for 21st Century security that we think will keep deterrence high in an increasingly complex and threatening global environment. As a company, we have a strong backlog, as you heard. We're driving operating discipline across the whole organization and this continuous improvement mindset we have. So all that's designed to position our company for U.S. shareholders for future growth and attractive and reliable returns to shareholders over a long period of time. So thank you all again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. Lois that concludes our call. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-23 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. In 2023, the 122,000 men and women of Lockheed Martin, working closely with our customers, made excellent progress advancing our 21st Century security strategy and delivered strong financial results for our shareholders. Turning to Chart 3. Robust demand for our broad portfolio of aircraft, helicopters, satellites, radar systems and other products, services and advanced digital technologies boosted backlog to a record $161 billion. Full-year sales of $67.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year and came in stronger than anticipated, as did earnings per share of $27.55. To position the company to take full advantage of these future growth opportunities, we invested more than $3 billion across research and development and capital in 2023. We generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, as expected, which resulted in year-over-year free cash flow per share percentage growth in the mid-single digits. We returned approximately 145% of free cash flow to shareholders over $9 billion through dividends and share repurchases combined. Our expectation for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook, include low single-digit growth in sales off of the higher 2023 base and a range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion of free cash flow. Our ongoing dividend and expectation for $4 billion of share repurchases will sustain our focus on returns to shareholders in 2024. We also plan to further advance our vision for 21st Century security in the year as we believe that it is our responsibility at Lockheed Martin to bring the best of U.S. and allied technology and industrial capability to help maintain an effective deterrent to arm conflict and to provide our armed forces with the capabilities to win should we need to. First, we work closely with our supply chain to apply anti-fragility measures and increased resilience. Through teaming arrangements to expand sources of supply and by making strategic investments in start-ups with cutting-edge technologies. For example, we are collaborating with a supplier in which we have a minority investment, to accelerate our additive manufacturing progress, reducing material and process dependencies and complex thermal management applications such as heat exchangers. We also stood up a wholly owned subsidiary called ForwardEdge ASIC to work with major semiconductor fabs to design and manufacture the cutting-edge microprocessors that we need. Second, we led the industry to broaden and strengthen the defense industrial base by making significant progress with our commercial technology collaborators to bring their innovations into the service and national defense. For example, in the fourth quarter, Lockheed Martin worked together with a team, including Intel, Verizon, Microsoft, Juniper Networks, Keysight and Radisys to successfully demonstrate a secure, resilient, hybrid 5G and military datalink network in a live field demonstration in Colorado. Our 5G.MIL unified network solutions performed as a tactical and commercial multi-node hybrid network for integrating land, air and space operations. Together, we demonstrated absolutely cutting-edge system capabilities, performance and operation for customers in a field setting by combining the best of our technology with those of our commercial teammates. Third, we deepened relationships internationally with partners and allies to ensure that the U.S. can drive maximum interoperability in both industry and in military operations. We are making progress towards a mission-centric approach that uses the latest digital technologies to network aircraft, satellites, command centers and other key elements together to vastly improve their effectiveness and deterrent value across our U.S. and allied customers. One example from 2023 is work with Australia to develop Phase 1 of AIR6500, that's a joint battle management system and the first of its kind in terms of situational awareness and interoperability. This increases collaboration with trusted allies and partners can also help reduce the fragility and increase the capacity of the defense production system. Last week, Lockheed Martin was awarded the guided weapons production capability Risk Reduction Activity contract, which will provide a mechanism for swift knowledge and technology transfer and serve as a path finder to manufacturing our suite of guided munitions in Australia with their workforce and with contributions from their society and their economy. Turning briefly now to the status of the U.S. defense budget. The current proposed agreement being discussed with the administration in Congress would support an $886 billion top line budget, 3% higher than 2023. We will continue to monitor the status of the U.S. budget process and strongly believe that Lockheed Martin programs will continue to be well supported as the process unfolds. I'll now review a few notable highlights from our operations. Starting with Aeronautics and the F-35. We delivered 18 F-35 aircraft in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR-2 configuration in the fourth quarter, bringing the 2023 total to 98 [Indiscernible]. We are making continued progress towards delivering the first TR-3 configured aircraft. Today, over 90% of the TR-3 functionality is currently in flight test, and we are further advancing the software integration to include additional aircraft and mission subsystems. While this system maturation process continues to advance, it is taking somewhat more time than we originally anticipated. A second quarter customer acceptance of delivery software remains our target. However, we now believe that the third quarter may be more likely scenario for a TR-3 software acceptance. We are taking the time and attention to get this technology insertion right the first time because it will be absolutely worth it. The step function technological advances of TR-3 will provide our customers with the onboard digital infrastructure of data storage, data processing and pilot user interface to provide unmatched capabilities for many years to come. These include increased types of capability for air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, advanced sensing, jamming and cybersecurity capabilities and more accurate target recognition. To achieve this level of reliable capability for the long run, the resulting aircraft delivery range for 2024 is between 75 and 110 and requires the TR-3 hardware suppliers to keep pace with production demands both this year and in the future. Given the increasing operational capability and digital connectivity of the aircraft is a cornerstone of all domain operations, international demand for the F-35 remains very strong. In December, the Republic of Korea made a decision to procure 20 additional F-35 aircraft. Also in December, we presented the first F-35A to the Belgian government, which will be one of more than 600 F-35 that will be stationed in Europe across NATO member bases by the 2030s. Aero also continued to advance the F-16 as the first European F-16 training center in Romania was inaugurated in November and a partnership with Romania and the Netherlands. This center will provide world-class training to enhance mission readiness and ensure safety of flying and operating F-16 fighter jets. In addition, we delivered the first two Slovakian F-16 Block 70 jets in the fourth quarter. Deliveries for Slovakia totaling 14 aircraft will continue through 2025. Aero Skunk Works continues to pioneer groundbreaking innovation as well. And for a change, I can actually tell you about one. The X59 experimental supersonic aircraft built by Skunk Works and NASA Aeronautics was selected as one of Time Magazine's best inventions of 2023. The X59 is expected to transform the future of commercial supersonic flight over land by quieting the sonic boom, one of aviation's most persistent challenges. The X59 was unveiled at a rollout ceremony earlier this month and is expected to take first flight later this year. Our MFC business continued to push technological advancements forward as well through modernization of air and missile defense and precision strike capabilities. In the fourth quarter, we delivered the first Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, to the U.S. Army and conducted system qualification test for an extended range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System or GMLRS, which will extend the range of the HIMARS system that many of you are familiar with. MFC also delivered the 800th THAAD, that's a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense interceptor to the U.S. government in October. And also, we successfully integrated the PAC-3 Patriot Missile with the U.S. Army's new air and missile defense radar system to defend against cruise missiles, tactical ballistic missiles as well as hypersonics. International demand for the PAC-3 remains strong too. This year, Switzerland and Romania each signed Letters of Offer and Acceptance for PAC-3 MFCs, marking 15 partner nations for this program. RMS also saw strong international interest in the fourth quarter. The U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Martin contract to produce eight MH-60 Romeo SEAHAWK helicopters for the Spanish Navy and six of them for the Norwegian government as well. To date, Sikorsky has delivered 330 MH-60 Romeo aircraft to five countries, including the United States, 67 more are on order or in production for India, Greece, South Korea, Australia and now Spain and Norway. Also in the quarter, Sikorsky installed the U.S. Army's improved turbine engine on our RAIDER X, designed for the Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft or FARA program. This final phase of the RAIDER X build brings us one step closer to completing the system that will support the Army's high-tech future missions requirements, and we anticipate the first flight of RAIDER X in late 2024. Finally, turning to space. United Launch Alliance successfully launched The Vulcan Centaur Rocket earlier in January. This launch was the first of two flights required to complete National Security Space Certification and the second planned mission could happen as soon as April. The U.S. Air Force awarded space a nearly $1 billion contract to develop a new reentry vehicle for the Sentinel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. The reentry vehicle or Mk21A will be mounted on top to Sentinel. The award follows a technology maturation and risk reduction contract and the ICBM recapitalization contributes to modernizing strategic deterrents and reinforcing Lockheed Martin's critical technological contributions to the nuclear triad. And last week, the Space Development Agency announced Lockheed Martin was awarded an almost $900 million contract for Tranche 2 Tracking Layer to provide 18 small sats, 16 of those space vehicles are for missile warning and tracking and two space vehicles are for missile defense infrared sensors to be on board. The first group of nine satellites is expected to launch in April of 2027. A lot going on at Lockheed Martin, all of our operations. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions.
Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will recap our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results and provide our initial guidance for 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. On Chart 4, we'll start with the fourth quarter results for consolidated sales and segment operating profit. We had a better-than-expected close to the year, nearly matching last year's record fourth quarter. Sales exceeded internal expectations by close to $1 billion, with the improvement largely due to material throughput, leading to a less than 1% year-over-year decline in the quarter and a sign of improving synchronization between Lockheed Martin's demand signals and supply chain fulfillment. The strong finish led to about 2.5% sales growth for the year, which was about $2 billion stronger on an absolute basis than originally expected last January. Overall segment operating profit in the quarter was also better than expected on the higher sales volume and was down 1% year-over-year due to lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings. Book-to-bill was 1.15 for the year with strength across all four segments. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS grew 2% year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher interest expense more than offset by benefits from the lower share count and fewer mark-to-market losses. Excluding mark-to-market activity and other nonrecurring charges, adjusted EPS was up $0.11 year-over-year or 1%. For the year, adjusted EPS was $27.82, up 2% year-over-year and consistent with the sales growth. The steady improvement this year resulted in higher adjusted EPS by about $1 per share from our original expectations last January. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $6.2 billion for the full-year, helped by approximately $625 million in working capital reductions in the fourth quarter from strong and timely conversion of operational milestone achievement to billings and collections. We maintained our commitment to shareholders by returning $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases this quarter and over $9 billion for the year or 145% of our free cash flow. Before getting into the segments, let me pause here to put the numbers in perspective. The key takeaway is that industry growth is crystallizing based on three converging demand cycles. First, to meet support requirements of the near and midterm security environment; second, to strengthen the effectiveness of existing security platforms and systems with improved sensing, connectivity, interoperability and embedded intelligence. And lastly, to recapitalize platforms and systems that maintain technological superiority in deterrence over a longer time frame. We expect these demand trends to endure and drive requirements to closely match with Lockheed Martin's advanced technology and systems integration capabilities. The long-cycle nature of Lockheed Martin Systems has in part, led to slower growth, but the 2023 results show that it is materializing as evidenced by our 7% increase in ending backlog to a record $161 billion as well as our return to top line growth a year earlier than originally expected. And we demonstrated our confidence in the company's positioning amongst these demand cycles and multiyear outlook by again delivering strong shareholder returns. Over the past two years, we have repurchased about 12% of the current market capitalization. Okay, back to the segment details and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Fourth quarter sales at Aero were comparable year-over-year with higher volume at Skunk Works and the F-16 production ramp offset by lower volume on F-35 primarily production cost timing. As expected, operating profit decreased 7% from the prior year due to lower net profit adjustments. For the year, sales were up 2% as growth in Skunk Works and F-16 more than offset a low single-digit decline on F-35. Profit declined by 1%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.14, leading to 6% growth in the backlog to $60 billion, with nearly 600 aircraft across all production platforms in the backlog. Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales in the quarter decreased 4% year-over-year, driven by lower volume on PAC-3 due to supplier cost timing, partially offset by production ramps on JASSM and LRASM. Segment operating profit decreased 12% year-over-year as expected due to the lower volume and loss recognition related to a classified program. For the year, sales decreased 1% year-over-year as growth in tactical and strike missiles were offset by program transitions at Sensors and Global Sustainment and integrated air and missile defense supplier cost timing. Operating profit was down 6% due to lower profit adjustments and the classified program loss. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.3, leading to 12% growth in backlog to $32 billion, driven by strong demand for tactical and strike missiles. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales declined 2% in the quarter, driven by lower volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and training and logistics systems lines of business, partially offset by higher sales at Sikorsky from deliveries of International Blackhawks. Operating profit increased 2% mainly due to favorable contract mix within our IWSS portfolio. For the year, sales were up 1% as growth in IWSS from Radar and battle management system ramps, more than offset declines in the other lines of business. Operating profit declined 2%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 with backlog growing 8% to $38 billion based on strong order intake on Sikorsky platforms as well as radar and battle management systems. On Chart 10, as expected, space growth moderated in the quarter with sales increasing 3% year-over-year, driven by higher volume in strategic and missile defense, primarily from Next Gen Interceptor as that program advances from its successful completion of preliminary design review towards the critical design review milestone. Operating profit increased 31% compared to 2022 driven by higher net profit adjustments across the portfolio. For the year, sales increased 9% with growth across all lines of businesses. And profit grew by 10% as benefits from higher profit adjustments and volume more than offset lower ULA equity income. Space backlog grew again in fourth quarter and remains at a solid $30 billion or almost 2.5x sales. Now shifting to the outlook for 2024 on Page 11. Before discussing our expectations, I'd like to highlight a few key assumptions embedded within our guidance for the year. First, based on recent progress made in budget negotiations, we assume the U.S. government passes appropriations bills by March, consistent with the funding levels within the President's FY '24 budget request, equating to approximately 3% top line growth for the DoD. On F-35, as Jim stated, we're targeting between 75 to 110 deliveries commencing in the third quarter. In addition, we anticipate sufficient progress being made on the MFC classified program to result in the recognition of losses from two production lots, amounting to approximately 50 basis points of margin headwind against our consolidated results. With that framework in mind, we anticipate sales between $68.5 billion and $70 billion, with the midpoint that represents approximately 2.5% growth. At the midpoint, we expect growth in three of the four segments with MFC leading the way at 7% growth from a strong munitions backlog. At the high end, all four segments would grow. Segment operating profit is expected to be between $7.175 billion and $7.375 billion down at the midpoint as lower expected profit adjustments and the MFC classified losses more than offset volume benefits. Excluding the MFC classified program, 50 basis points impact, underlying margins in the balance of the portfolio are expected to be approximately 11%. Our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment declines around $400 million from last year to a little less than $1.7 billion for 2024 due primarily to lower FAS pension income. The pension headwind, along with lower segment profit and higher interest expense lead to lower expected EPS year-over-year to be between $25.65 and $26.35. For purposes of clarity, on Page 12, we've included an EPS walk at the midpoint of the range. Benefits from volume mix provide about $0.55, with the impact of the MFC classified program losses, netting down segment operating profit to a $0.35 decline. Total FAS/CAS pension is about $1.40 headwind with higher taxes and interest more than offset by the lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2024 has ranged between $6 billion and $6.3 billion. So bringing it all together, we expect continued sales growth in 2024 off the higher 2023 base, some profit and EPS pressure based on loss recognition timing, but with continued solid cash generation and capping it off with another year of capital deployment. So in summary, on Page 13. We closed out 2023 with record backlog and positive momentum that will carry us into 2024 with a line of sight to sustained out-year growth in sales, profit and free cash flow. Of course, we will continue to invest in 1LMX as part of our strategy to ensure our people, processes and systems remain the most advanced in the industry, and we remain committed to disciplined and dynamic capital returns to shareholders. With that, Luis, let's open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to lead off with Aero and F-35 in particular, in the margins, number one, that you're looking for in '24 are down about 40 basis points. Is that primarily on lower incentives as a result of the delays in delivery. And then more broadly, for the supply chain on the F-35, given the absence of deliveries, can you continue to simply build inventory, or is there a point at which you'd actually have to slow down the supply chain? Thanks.
Jay Malave: Okay. Thanks, Myles. On the margins for F-35, what we're seeing in 2024 are lower favorable profit adjustments, and so it's really twofold. One of it is the F-35, where as we make progress on the TR-3 program as well as getting ourselves into production, it's difficult to take risk and rely on risk retirements as we're still facing this program and the progress we're making there. And so we assume that the profit adjustments slowdown in 2024 on the F-35 program. There's also some headwinds on C-130 program, where we're seeing the effects of inflation and also some disruption related to supply chain, some pressures that we've had there. And so when you look at that decline year-over-year, you're talking about 30 basis points, say, half and half between C-130 and F-35. On the production cadence for F-35, yes, we feel pretty confident in where we are through the third quarter. To the extent that there were any delays beyond that, we would have to revisit our production cadence at that point in time. But right now, all signs are pointing to our production and delivery restart here in the third quarter.
Myles Walton: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Scott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Jay Malave: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Deuschle: Jay, here to ask on 2025, but at a high level, is the 10.5% total company margin guide for '24, is that the right jumping off point for thinking about 25%, or is it the 11% underlying margin, or is it the 10.8% margin you did in '23, just in terms of identifying jumping off point for thinking about '25? Thank you.
Jay Malave: Yes, I think you do have to start at the 10.5% to jump off. And we do have a line of sight and a path to get overall back to 11%, including the absorption of these losses on the MFC classified program, but it's going to be a gradual march back up. And so I wouldn't expect it to snap back in 2025. I would expect there to be in the range of, say, 10 to 20 basis points of improvement starting in '25, and that to continue to grow at that rate until we get back up to 11.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question is from Gavin Parsons from UBS Equity Research. Please go ahead.
Gavin Parsons: Hey, good morning.
Jay Malave: Good morning.
Gavin Parsons: Jay, what does the pension contribution schedule look like beyond 2024? And do you have any opportunity to pull that forward or use the balance sheet to offset that?
Jay Malave: Yes, a good question. That's something that we've contemplated. Just where we are from a baseline perspective, zero contributions required in 2024. 2025, we're looking at in the range of about $1 billion of required contributions there. And so we're always looking at whether or not there's an opportunity to pull forward. As you mentioned, the utilization of our strong balance sheet to potentially do that. We haven't made any firm decisions on that, but that's definitely an opportunity that's under consideration for us.
Gavin Parsons: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning guys.
Jay Malave: Good morning.
Pete Skibitski: Jim or Jay, can you give us a sense for how much the '24 guide is impacted by what looks like on the order of a six-month delay here to the government's budget and still a little bit of lack of clarity in the supplementals?
Jay Malave: Yes, for the most part, Pete, it's not really impacted significantly. In our case, we're able to build up inventories. And then as we get the funding, we're able to take that to sales. And so for the most part, we've kept all of our processes intact up. That becomes more difficult if the process extends beyond March. And that's why I was very clear in my comments that we’re dependent on this happening that the budget getting clarity and finalization in March. Because going beyond that makes it very -- just makes it difficult for things to get on contract and you run out of runway in the year to convert those into sales.
Pete Skibitski: Okay. Appreciate it. And then anything on big awards you're expecting in '24 and maybe the timing of NGAD?
Jay Malave: Well, just some key things that we're talking about from sales perspective. Lot '18, '19 is a big one for the F-35 program. We also have some long lead F-35 awards that we would be expecting as well. We've got things -- there are some classified contracts across the portfolio. I can't really get into any beyond that. But you're talking multi-billions of dollars there that we have in our order plan for this year. There are things like PAC-3 orders, which is multiple billions of dollars there for FY '24 requirements. And also, I would say hypersonics space, particularly on CPS is another one that can approach $2 billion. So there are a number there. As those get clicked off in the year, we'll certainly report on those and keep you appraised on the progress.
Peter Skibitski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi Research. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky: Yes, hey, Jay, just a quick clarification then one for Jim and sorry if I missed this, but the deliveries that you're expecting for the F-35 this year with the acceptance on T-3 happening potentially in the third quarter. Can you discuss a little bit about the cadence throughout the year? Do you expect to deliver some F-35s throughout the year and maybe the older version of it in the first half of the year? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you're truly doing 75 to 100 aircraft in the second half of the year? And what does that tell us about the potential for deliveries in 2025. Can you get to 200 in that year as a bit of a catch-up? And then, Jim, for you, just overall expectations on bookings, book-to-bill for this next year based on the pipeline that you're seeing and maybe just kind of update us on your current thoughts on the competitive environments and fixed price versus cost plus, and how you -- how the industry and you all specifically are kind of reacting to the contracting environment and what's being asked of you and whether you're toggling back more towards less risky programs? Thanks.
Jay Malave: So let me get into the deliveries. Jason, we do have a handful of deliveries we expect in the first half. But for the most part, you're talking 90% of the anticipated deliveries actually will happen in the back half of the year. And so I think that's just the way to think about just a handful, really in the first half. Maybe I'll kind of give a little bit of color and then hand it over to Jim. For the year, we still expect there to be strong demand, and we have a pretty solid line of sight to a book-to-bill that would be above one yet again in 2024. And so obviously, these things have to materialize. The budget has to be approved and all these things have to happen. But the line of sight is there for continued growth in orders as well as in our backlog. A couple of things, too, and you've just done the question about cost plus. The interesting thing is that part of the margin pressure that we saw in 2023 was due to mix. Our percent of sales of cost type contracts went from 38% in 2022 to 41% in 2023. That in itself caused some margin pressure of about 20 basis points relative to what we were anticipating in the year. And so we're actually seeing an uptick in cost plus contracts, which we think kind of bodes well from terms of risk tolerance in the way some of these stronger technological types of programs will be contracted for. And so I think that is, generally speaking, a favorable trend. Well, the other thing that we're -- just to talk about what we're thinking about contractually, and Jim has really led the way here is that we just are employing a lot more pricing discipline than we have more recently. And we're looking at things and ensuring that there's just a more analytical support for the way we approach pricing. Do we capture any types of technological advantages that we may have also that as we make an assessment of risk, a, the contracting vehicle is appropriate to that risk, but that our pricing accounts for that risk as well. And so that's the way we've been approaching things for really this year going into 2024. And I'll hand it over to Jim.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. Sure, Jay. So look, there's a near-term and a long-term approach that we're taking to government contracting with industry. And the near-term piece of it is a lot of what Jay just described, really matching the pricing and the risk profile within our company, I'll say. Now I don't know what other companies doing and how they're making their decisions. But what we've recognized and I've said to our senior customer base, look, we're in a monopsony environment here, meaning there's a single buyer for the most part, for almost everything that we make or Boeing Defense makes or Gel Dynamics makes. And so I guess, the government's credit in a way, they've been taking advantage of that monopsony power, if you will, over the industry. And what's happened as a result of that over the last number of years or even decades is you have lots of programs which are over cost, cost overruns, right, whether fixed price or cost plus and you have scheduled delays because what that monopsony environment can do is give so much power to the buyer that some of the competitors feel that there are must-win programs for them that they will take tremendous risk on cost and pricing and tremendous cost on the ability to technically deliver these capabilities. So when you multiply those two risks together, you get a lot of cost overruns, a lot of schedule delays, programs reviewed by Congress, et cetera. So I've been advocating in the near term and certainly implementing with our company, we don't have any must-win programs at Lockheed Martin anymore. If we have a good business opportunity with a balanced price risk profile, we will bid. If not, we will not bid. If we hit our limit parameters, we won't go beyond those, a competitor may win, so be it. And so that's our near-term approach to this. The longer-term approach is in addition to delivering products that we and our cohorts in the traditional defense industry do so well, we need to start migrating towards delivering capabilities, right? So capability would include either products that are already fielded and/or new products, but especially digital technologies, which is why we are collaborating with so much effort with commercial tech companies large and small, because we can value price capabilities, right? If we sell products, and that's all we do as an industry, we are kind of locked into the far, the federal acquisition regulation as it is written today, which means even a fixed price contract, you've got to provide all your cost information, right? And you have to do it often every year even with a multi-year fixed price, and there can be adjustments. So we want to move as briskly as we can as an industry with our commercial partners to their kind of pricing, which is value-based subscription. That's going to take time. It's going to take changes in government. It's going to probably take literally act of Congress to do it. But that will be the thing that will make our industry healthier on one hand, the traditional defense and aerospace industry, but it will also invite in the commercial tech companies who are basically, if you look at the broad scope investing 10x what we are in R&D. And we want to bring a lot of that 10x R&D and all that talent over into the defense department as part of their supply chain, but it's really tough under the bar for those companies to put time and attention and effort into DoD. So that's the long-term -- a long-term solution, but the near-term solution will also continue.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Douglas Harned: As you look at Tech Refresh 3, this delay and then going longer, as you really want to build out the full kind of Block 4 capabilities, which continue to seem to expand. First, as Tech Refresh 3 takes longer. And then as you look toward the kind of multi-year trajectory on Block 4 implementation, how do you see delays here affecting your production rate, knowing that you've been trying to produce sort of at the full 156 type rate. But can that continue as you look at these challenges if they get more difficult?
Jim Taiclet: Look Doug, it's Jim. I think we can continue at this rate. Demand from the U.S. services and our international customers, Air Forces, Navy's, et cetera, around the world is they need the aircraft, right? They've got to recapitalize the planes that they're still flying that I was trying to get when I went to pilot training in 1983, right? So this is essential that this production line keep up, it's the -- basically, it's the recapitalization of the Allied fighter aircraft for us is the F-35. And so I think the key to that is full transparency and realizing the reality of the situation. When you're trying to drive this much technology into an air vehicle, you've got to be honest about the schedule. What can industry do, what can the test and evaluation community handle in the various military to accept that technology and what's the supply chain capacity. And we're being brutally honest with our services and our joint program offices to what we think industry can do with us and our airplane. And industry is who makes the radar. Industry is who makes the EOT, the electrical optical system. The industry is who makes the electronic warfare suite. It's not us. So we have to be brutally honest as an industry and with our suppliers' inputs to that with the government and say what is feasible to keep the production rate up. I think that's starting to get traction. I hope it gets more traction, because we cannot afford to be overoptimistic in the ability to deliver these technologies as rapidly as one might like. There are real technical and physical challenges to doing this. And well our commitment to the government, meeting the service chiefs and our allies is I will tell you honestly, what we think industry can do with the jet. And if you want to push it beyond that, I'll tell you what the risks are and what the cost might be to do it. But let's agree on a feasible executable plan for exactly Doug, what you talked about.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Jim, I don't want to talk about what happened in 1983, but in terms of the puts and takes for MSC, if you could just talk about the 7% top line growth you guys have what are the biggest program drivers there between missile defense and tactical, and just on the margins, you've already highlighted the 50 bps from the classified programs. Are there any offsets? And I really appreciate your commentary about the government and how you plan to sell to them. So I was just thinking, where do you think that will manifest itself in its portfolio in your portfolio, the fact is, is it MFC? And specifically, can you give any specifics?
Jay Malave: Yes. Sure. I'll start with the growth drivers. And for MFC, you would expect, tactical and strike missiles. So the guided weapons, the HIMARS, JASSM, LRASM, all those will continue towards their march through these ramps by 2025 and in certain cases, 2026 and 2027. So that is the largest driver of the growth. And that's followed by Integrated Air and Missile Defense really on the back of PAC-3. So we'll start seeing a more significant spike in PAC-3 activity and deliveries over the next few years here as we get to 550 by 2025, and then ultimately 650 by 2027. So those are the two -- really the two businesses, the lines of business within MFC that are going to be driving it, which is really should be no surprise.
Jim Taiclet: And then when it gets to moving towards a value pricing model, Sheila. The first place that's already starting to happen is in command and control, command situational awareness, information advantages our customers would call it. So those are largely digital services, right? You've got sensors on satellites, aircraft, ships, radars out scanning the sky, infrared sensors in space looking for looms of heat when a missile is launched, things like that. That's data, right? So how do we gathered all the data from our sensors, whatever domain they happen to be in land airspace, et cetera. How do we make intelligent data fusion, and then present commanders and decision makers with options using AI and other digital services. So this will be probably the first place where we can value price because my goal is to bring in commercial technology to do that digital, digital data fusion, evaluation, AI application, et cetera. As I said a minute ago, commercial industry is investing 10x what our aerospace and defense industry could invest in these areas, and we need to take advantage of that. The only way they're going to participate in a material fashion in that industry is value pricing. They're not going to provide cost information. It's just not how their industry works. They're not delivering an airplane that you can add up all the costs that it took to make that airplane and give it to the government, so they can give you the margin on top. So these command and control systems, and they're real programs, by the way, defensive Blohm is a program like this, AIR6500 is one dimension. And also something called Joint Fires Network, which will be deployed in the Indo Paycom Command of the U.S. So this is where I think it will start. And then as we look at mission road maps that we've established and drawn out inside of Lockheed Martin, and we're now sharing and have been sharing with the U.S. services and VOD. We're looking for capability gaps where digital technology can really make a difference, right? So I'll give you one really quick one. So if we could get a direct feed from an orbiting satellite scanning a wide swath of the Pacific to find ships and actually directly provide that data link and that information to aircraft flying in the area, then those aircraft can vector towards those targets and turn on their radars and get a much more precise location and maybe even a tracking solution to sync the ship if that's what's needed. And so that's a mission gap, a capability gap that we would have in an antiship mission. And so how do we value price that because that's basically a data management exercise, which requires what we call 5G.MIL. It requires an artificial intelligence solution within it, and it requires the management of that data at various classifications, which is something not many companies can do besides those in our industry. So we can value price something like that. And I think it'd be a capability gap that would be interesting to the Department of Defense, and they might accept value pricing, but not to take too much time on this topic. But one of the things that we're really advocating for at Lockheed Martin, and we've got some friends of the court trying to work with us on this is, how do we set up an adjacent acquisition process in the Department of Defense to its traditional acquisition process, designed and reconstituted and originated to purchase digital services versus platforms and products, which is what the traditional acquisition system is built to do. That is a heavy lift. It is very complicated. It's what I've kind of referenced earlier, where you're literally going to need to act the contrast to do this. But if we want to value price as an industry, bringing commercial partners at scale, I think the government needs to consider and actually go do this with us.
Jay Malave: Let me just circle back, Sheila, on the margins in your question. I'll use MFC as an example in 2024. When you look at their headwind, the headwind is about 200 basis points of margin compression in the year 2024. The MSC classified program is actually accounted for 230. And so the rest of their business is actually expanding by 30 basis points. And so they're doing everything we would expect them to do in their core business. In general, across all of Lockheed Martin, the way we're approaching these headwinds is really threefold. First, we're just keeping a tight lid on overhead and indirect costs and streamlining that cost structure where the opportunities exist. The second is we're driving cost reduction in our direct cost base through supply chain optimization, factory productivity and also on 1LMX driven efficiencies. And then lastly, we talked about a little bit earlier in the call, is just making sure that we're employing pricing discipline across our bid and proposals. And so those three together will help us drive to a better result in the future and give us confidence that we'll be able to expand margins even with these headwinds.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Thanks very much. And good morning, everyone. Maybe one clarification and one question. Jay, on F-35, at the end of '24, should we think about there being maybe 120 undelivered aircraft in inventory based on the production rate of 150 plus and the deliveries you've told us, that's the clarification, and that inventory will have to be worked out over the subsequent year or two. And then as far as the question goes, I think you talked about 10 to 20 basis points of segment margin expansion in '25. If we thought about only one lot exercised on classified missile, that's probably 25 basis points. The margin in aeronautics seems pretty depressed in '24. So you think there may be some potential for expansion there. And you just talked about the efforts that you're making across the company to support margins. Are there other discrete headwinds that we're not aware of that wouldn't allow -- that would prevent more than that kind of 10 to 20 basis points that you outlined?
Jay Malave: Yes. Let me start with that question first, and I'll come back to the F-35. Just on the 2025 margins going forward, yes, it would be essentially one lot versus two. However, you got to take into account the volumes that are in that lot versus the volumes that we're in these first two lots. And so you really -- you think about it from a gross headwind, it doesn't necessarily change all that much, because you're -- there's more in there. And so that's what's keeping the pressure. There's not just an automatic lift, because we're going from two lots to one lot in a subsequent year. On the F-35, I mean, I think the way you've talked about it Seth is right, anywhere between 100 to 120 aircraft is in terms of undelivered -- against the 156 type of expected delivery rate is the right way to think about it, yes.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: [indiscernible] question.
Jim Taiclet: Hey, Ron.
Ronald Epstein: I'll do the question first. What are you thinking about the opportunity for the Black Hawk going forward, meaning I don't know, we've kind of heard there's some challenges on future vertical lift. And what opportunities does that open to you for the Black Hawk?
Jim Taiclet: Ron, it's Jim. Look, the Black Hawk, and I've gotten a flight autonomously and by hand actually. I think has a lot of potential. There's interesting Congress for modernization of the Black Hawk. There's a huge fleet out there. And by adding some of these digital capabilities like autonomy and AI to the Black Hawk, which is a really reliable platform that's offline in units today in great numbers and across our allies. That's a real, I think, value opportunity for the Army's in ring cores and others that use the helicopter. So I do think there's a lot of upside there. I don't want to comment on anybody else's programs or how well or not they may be doing, but this is a proven scaled vehicle with digital technology upgrade and insertion can be very, very versatile. And that can be done much more rapidly than new production of new aircraft. So I do think that there is upside there. Now the services and Congress have to agree. And to that and fund those modernizations and keep those units flying. And that will be up to them. But we are trying to provide them every opportunity to make that decision by inserting digital and other technologies like autonomy that will really make the aircraft much more capable in doing missions like air evacuation, resupply of the hot landing zone, things like that, that when you put it into the entire equation, of completing a mission, it will be a good value to consider it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: Hey, Jay, Jim, I mean, there's been discussion in the public markets about the depletion of U.S. missiles ammunitions and a potential shortage mean that side from your commentary today, it sounds like supply chain issues continue to linger, weighing on the company's ability to convert the demand into revenue. So can you talk more about the additional actions you're taking to improve the supply chain's ability to get products through the system? And what metrics are you monitoring? And how much upside could you see in 2024 if things improve?
Jim Taiclet: I'll make a couple of comments and ask Jay to follow. The steps that we're taking to take the fragility out of the missile production system are varied. One of them is -- and it's very specific, we are endeavoring to stand up a third solid rocket motor supplier in the United States that can be additive to the industry supply chain we have today, which hasn't been performing well, right? That's one piece. More broadly, we're using additive manufacturing, and we're bringing in more varied suppliers into the supply chain, so that we can get the materials we need from a more diverse set of group of suppliers outside of solid rocket motors. And also, we're looking at international opportunities to build this equipment including in Australia and in Poland, U.K. and others are kind of on tap for coproduction or joint ventures with us to do these things, in Germany, I should mention as well. So these are some of the approaches we're taking. And it really comes down to these three areas, which is how can we on one hand take basic steps in anti-fragility to more suppliers, more diversity on the supply chain, different labor pools, better training, those kinds of things where it's just basic. Secondly, how can we insert technology to make this more reliable production system, which we just mentioned. And then thirdly is how do we get international countries and take advantage of their labor forces, their supply to sub-supply chains, et cetera, and get them into the production system. So we look at this in all three areas of our core company strategy and apply it to missile production. Jay, anything you want to add?
Jay Malave: Yes. I'll just say over the last year, Kristine, we've deployed resources. So we haven't just sat back and waiting for improvement. Depending on the supplier, depending on the issues, we have deployed manufacturing engineering resources. We've deployed quality engineering resources and program management resources as well as, in certain cases, we've actually deployed hourly workers to support suppliers in certain cases. And so we've taken an all-hands on deck approach, where we've seen the issues become more significant. And we've done everything we can to support these suppliers and help them get through. I would expect that to continue where we see these bottlenecks. But as I mentioned earlier, we did see some general improvement. We are expecting that improvement to continue. And in terms of potential upside, what I would point you to is that if we're able to unlock and see a little bit better performance and that what drives to the high end of our sales profit and EPS range.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Matthew Akers: Hey, good morning. Thanks guys. Could you touch on F-16 real quick, just latest thoughts on the ramp rate here and also just margins on that program that compares to the segment now? And then sort of do they get better over time as you kind of come back down learning curve?
Jay Malave: Yes. So we delivered five aircrafts in 2023. We would expect that to triple potentially quadruple here in 2024. And so we're -- the ramp is certainly in full force. We've got over 30 aircraft there in WIP as we ended the year. And so that is, I think, from a delivery standpoint, increasing the production cadence is all trending well. From a profitability standpoint, you may recall, we've had some pressure because it's taken us longer to get to this point. And so that puts some pressure on our initial contracts. Here, as we fully deliver those out and deliver on the subsequent contracts, we will see profitability improve on the F-16 over the next few years.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes, hello.
Jim Taiclet: Hey, George.
George Shapiro: I'm talking at a longer-term perspective here. If I look at the margins like from 10 years ago, MFC made 18%, aeronautics made 11%, space made 13%. And so we're obviously down in all of those categories overall, maybe 200 basis points in 10 years ago. So my question is, was this due to a lot of the fixed price development, more aggressive bidding. And now you're trying to change that. So when we look towards 2025, we actually could see margins go up from where they'd be in 2024 for kind of -- are they just lower margins overall that we expect to see from what we used to see?
Jim Taiclet: George, hey, it's Jim here. I think the story, I told a little bit earlier today is what caused that. There was margin compression in the whole industry here, driven by the [indiscernible] [1:00:20] customer, if you will. So they got pretty good at figuring out how to use their position in the quarter analysis of how they should negotiate contracts. And what I think you're seeing is boards and management of companies in our traditional space, I'll call it, are understanding this now, the management tends to not necessarily -- senior management tends not to necessarily be historically wedded to this business model and looking at other ways to run these companies. And so we are taking the shareholders' interest into account and all the things we talked about, which should help improve our margins, even though it may result in some difficult discussions with some of the customer base. We're prepared to do that. But I think over the last 10 years, as you said, there's been a decline and it needs to reverse to have a healthy industry.
Maria Ricciardone: Okay. Luis, I think we're at the top of the hour. So I'm just going to turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.
Jim Taiclet: Okay. Thanks, Maria. So over the past 12 months, again, I mentioned the people of Lockheed Martin have worked relentlessly to advance this vision we have for 21st Century security and transform our company internally, and they created produced and delivered cutting-edge capabilities that are focused on what the defense department says as its own strategy that they call integrated deterrence. And we're trying to maintain our company values along the way, and that's to do what's right, respect others and perform with excellence. And all this yields positive results for our employees at work here, our customers and our suppliers and especially our shareholders. So thanks again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. Luis, that concludes the call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-17 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Maria Ricciardone Lee: Thank you, Lois, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer.

These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us on our third quarter 2023 earnings call. All of us on the line today are well aware that since our last call, the world is now seeing yet another terrible conflict. Everyone in our company remains dedicated to fully supporting the United States government's policy and efforts to deter aggression, restore security and achieve peace. Today, I will first highlight our third quarter results as we pursue our vision of 21st Century Security, designed to support the U.S. Department of Defense Strategy of Integrated deterrents and then I'll turn it over to Jay to provide additional detail before taking your questions. Starting on Page 3 of the slides. Sales increased 2% year-over-year to $16.9 billion and backlog remains at historically high levels at $156 million. EPS of $6.73 exceeded prior year and free cash flow was a strong $2.5 billion. We returned approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Earlier in October, we announced a $0.15 increase in our dividend which reflects 5% growth and is the 21st consecutive year of dividend increases for Lockheed Martin. At the same time, our Board also approved a $6 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $13 billion, reconfirming our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We are also reaffirming our full year 2023 financial outlook for sales, profit, EPS and free cash flow. Given the current status of the 2024 U.S. defense budget, global geopolitical tensions and the macroeconomic environment, we will provide our expectations for our 2024 financial outlook during our full year 2023 earnings call in January. On the U.S. budget, though the specific trajectory of the future U.S. defense budget is still in process between the administration and Congress, the global threat landscape is increasingly elevated. Our robust backlog reflects the relevance and importance of the Lockheed Martin portfolio and elevating deterrence to great power conflict involving the United States and its allies and the solid positioning of our business to serve our domestic and international customers. From a process standpoint and government, the current continuing resolution or CR is in place through November 17. At that point, one of the following could occur. FY '24 appropriations bills will be enacted, Congress will enact another partial or whole CR or there could be a partial or full government shutdown. In any of these scenarios, there continues to be the option also for supplemental requests related to support Ukraine, Israel and potentially Taiwan. As Congress continues to work through the FY '24 appropriations bills, we are optimistic that there will be consistent support for the National Defense strategy and funding for its priorities. In the meantime, we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions due to the process. And we will press on with executing our 21st Century security strategy of building capacity, efficiency and resilience into our production operations, driving advanced digital technologies to enhance integrated deterrents and expanding our international business and operations. Turning to the F-35 program. We delivered 30 F-35 aircraft in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 80 jets. Consistent with our announcement in September, we continue to expect to deliver a total of 97 aircraft this year, all in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR2 configuration. We are producing F-35s at a rate of 156 per year, and expect to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR3 software development testing. And we recently began flight test evaluations of the next software release that encompasses major systems upgrades such as improved RADAR, next-gen distributed aperture system and weapons capability. As previously announced, we continue to expect to deliver the first TR3 configured aircraft between April and June of 2024. The superior technological capabilities of the F-35 continue to generate strong interest both domestically and internationally. In September, Denmark's first four locally based F-35 aircraft arrived on their home soil. Denmark's program of record calls for 27 F-35A aircraft. Also in September, the Czech Republic chose to become part of the global F-35 Lightning II program, and the U.S. State Department approved a possible $5 billion foreign military sale to South Korea for up to 25 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Earlier in the quarter, Israel announced that we'll buy an additional 25 F-35, which will add a third squadron and increased its F-35 fleet to 75 aircraft. Additionally, in August, Lockheed Martin was selected by the Australian Department of Defense, as their strategic partner for their Air 6500 program Phase 1. This transformational Pathfinder program will deliver the broadest scope of Joint All Domain Operations, JADO in the free world, and will completely revolutionize the way the Australian defense force operates. By connecting Australian systems and platforms that operate across air, space, land, sea and cyber domains, we expect that Air 6500 will set the blueprint for future military operations worldwide. This proven technology will provide greater situational awareness and defense against increasingly advanced air and missile threats and enables significantly greater interoperability between Australia and allied nations. Lockheed Martin will lead this first phase which will provide the core architecture and multi-domain integration for the program. This is just one recent win that demonstrates the business success of our 21st Century security cornerstone, trusted and reliable battle management and command and control systems that integrate across multiple domains, military services and allied forces. Late last year, Lockheed Martin also won the $500 million Defense of Guam award. And in late September, we were also awarded a potential seven-year, over $1 billion contract for systems engineering and software integration to the integrated combat system across the surface force portfolio of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. This will link together systems and software across the services and a JADO construct and it not only enables faster decision-making and better capabilities but also serves as a much more effective global deterrent strategy. Beyond these awards, we continue to develop 21st Century security technologies to advance interoperability between Lockheed Martin product lines. The 5G.MIL hybrid base station that our engineers invented is the 1 LM initiative that includes teams at MFC and Aeronautics. We recently transferred data from a sniper targeting pod that was set up in Orlando, Florida to the Tactical Missile Simulation Lab in Grand Prairie, Texas to provide real-time updates to a simulated missile in-flight. This event significantly advanced efforts towards upcoming live fire demonstrations across the main platforms operating in a joint environment that will use data from multiple sources across an open architecture. Also, Skunk Works partnered with the University of Iowa's Operator Performance Laboratory to demonstrate an AI commanded jamming capability. In this, we successfully used artificial intelligence on two air systems to provide jamming support to a simulated strike against enemy air defenses. This demonstration showed how AI agents with high performance and reliable behavior can operate in close coordination with and be controlled by human crude aircraft. We also conducted a successful test of the prototype radio for the PAC-3 MSC missile that will enable communications with the SPY-1 radar, the key sensor in the Aegis Weapon System. This test performed by a 1 LM team across MFC and RMS paves the way for the design of a multifrequency radio data link for PAC-3 MSC. In turn, that will enable the U.S. Navy for the first time to have the ability to integrate the state-of-the-art PAC-3 missile onto its warships and open up another opportunity for Lockheed Martin in the future. International interest in PAC-3 also remains strong. As demonstrated by our deepening partnership with Poland, which signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 644 PAC-3 MSCs and related equipment in the quarter. In our RMS business, Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter is expected to grow meaningfully also over the coming years. In August, we won a $2.7 billion contract to build and deliver 35 additional CH-53K helicopters and it's the largest procurement to date for this multi-mission aircraft. Another longstanding major Lockheed Martin program, this one is space is also poised for significant growth ramp. In late September, the Fleet Ballistic Missile program won a $1.2 billion contract for the Navy's Trident II D5 life extension. For nearly seven decades, Lockheed Martin has supported the U.S. Navy as a critical partner for its mission to provide sea-based strategic deterrents. The TRIDENT II D5 LE missile will be in service through the 2040s, maintaining the proven performance of the D5 system for significantly less cost to the government than of designing a new missile. Also in our Space business, Lockheed Martin's Next Generation Interceptor or NGI program, executed its digital preliminary design review in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency customer. That happened on September 29. During this review, the MDA assessed the NGI program's readiness and maturity to continue into the detailed design phase, confirming that our solution continues to meet the requirements for this crucial and demanding mission. Finally, the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule touched down in the Utah Desert on September 24, returning NASA's first ever sample from an asteroid. After a seven-year mission traveling approximately, I believe is 4 billion miles in space. The capsule holds material from Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid and scientists hope it will teach us more about the origins of organics that led to life on earth, plus the mechanics behind overall planet formation After release of the capsule, the spacecraft was set on a new course to investigate the asteroid Apophis under the mission name OSIRIS-REx. So with that interesting and exciting news, I'll turn it over the call to Jay and join you later for questions. Jay?
Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter 2023 financial results. I'll also provide an update to our full year 2023 guidance, and offer a few comments on 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Starting on Chart 4, with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Third quarter sales increased 2% year-over-year with three of the four business areas delivering growth. Segment operating profit was down 6% year-over-year due to lower net favorable profit adjustments and lower equity earnings, resulting in segment margins of 10.7%. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS was comparable year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher net interest expense offset by favorable below-the-line items, including lower share count, lower tax rate and fewer mark-to-market losses. On an adjusted basis, EPS was down $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to the lower profit. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. Our free cash flow was strong at over $2.5 billion in the quarter or 150% of net income, helped in part by our focus on working capital, primarily due to better collections at the end of the government fiscal year. Once again, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning 99% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've returned almost $5.3 billion or 116% of free cash flow. As Jim mentioned, our Board approved a 5% increase to the quarterly dividend and an additional $6 billion in share repurchase authorization. These tools remain a key part of our total shareholder return strategy. Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Third quarter sales at Aero decreased 5% driven by lower volume on F-35, partially offset by higher volume at Skunk Works. F-35 production was down due to the previously mentioned Lot 15 through 17 sales catch up in the third quarter of 2022, and an overall more linear throughput this year. Both development and sustainment saw solid year-over-year growth in the quarter. Operating profit decreased 12% from the prior year due to the lower volume and lower net profit adjustments. On the F-16 program, international interest remains strong. We delivered the second Block 70 aircraft to Bahrain in July and in September, the first Block 70 aircraft for the Slovak Republic was unveiled at our facility in Greenville, South Carolina. The Slovak Republic will be the first European country to receive this newest and most capable version of the Fighting Falcon. Today's latest version, the Block 772 will be flown by six countries and counting. With a backlog of 126 aircraft as of the third quarter, the F-16 program continues to play a crucial role in 21st Century security missions for international allies. It will be a key contributor to growth over the coming years. Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales increased 4% year-over-year driven by higher sales volumes on munitions programs within tactical strike missiles, partially offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit also increased 4% year-over-year due to the higher net profit adjustments. Margins were comparable at 13.5%. MSC has built a strong backlog and we continue to see strong demand for our missiles and munitions with allied nations seeking to improve the security posture amidst today's complex threat environment. This backlog provides a foundation for growth over the coming years across several of our product lines, including PAC-3, GMLRS, HIMARS, Javelin and JASSM and LRASM. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and C6ISR lines of business. Operating profit increased 2% due to higher sales volume and was partially offset by lower net profit adjustments. RMS backlog increased in the quarter, primarily due to the $2.7 billion CH-53K award, which is pictured for Lot 7 and 8, the first full rate production launch as part of the U.S. Marine Corps 200 aircraft program of record. This significant contract bolsters Sikorsky and its partners creates additional production efficiencies and provides the U.S. Marine Corps with transformative capabilities. On Chart 10, we continue to see strong growth across our space portfolio with sales increasing 8% year-over-year driven by higher volume on NGI, fleet ballistic missile, GPS and Orion programs. Operating profit decreased 15%, as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Space backlog grew slightly to over $30 billion at the end of the third quarter helped by the $800 million transport layer tranche two award for 36 beta satellites. Transport Layer is part of the proliferated space architecture and will strengthen deterrents with more resilient space architectures for beyond line of sight targeting, data transport and advanced missile detection and tracking. With this award, we will build and deliver a total of 88 data communication satellites to the Space Development Agency in support of their low-earth orbit constellations. Okay, now shifting to our 2023 expectations on Page 11. For the full year, we're holding the outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We've successfully driven and delivered more linear results in 2023 than prior years, which enables more efficient use of our capacity, but sets up for a difficult compares to last year's fourth quarter. In conjunction with our recent announcement of increased share repurchase authorization, we're increasing our share repurchase forecast for 2023 to $6 billion, provided there is not an extended shutdown scenario. These repurchases along with dividends, are expected to return nearly 150% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. And between 2022 and 2023, we are on track to repurchase nearly 13% of our current market cap. We're also set to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth in 2023, and we're positioning the company to continue that level of growth in the future. Okay. A few comments on 2024. While we don't have a formal outlook to share, I'll provide a few directional markers as we see them today, barring any environmental setbacks. We still anticipate low single-digit sales growth as we convert our strong backlog position. As I previously mentioned, the backlog supports a higher growth rate, but the value chain remains constrained by extended lead times that have yet to compress. On segment margins, we expect the underlying business to be relatively flat year-over-year, but anticipate variability caused by the timing of impacts from the MFC classified program. And at free cash flow, we're following the budget process to determine whether it will have an impact on the timing of our program schedules and milestones but are continuing to set internal targets that deliver mid-single-digit growth and free cash flow per share. Okay. Let's wrap it up. Results through the first three quarters have been solid with a long-term demand environment that is favorable to Lockheed Martin's 21st Century security capabilities. Our focus on linearity and working capital is helping to drive more consistent sales and improved cash flow. We're maintaining our full year outlook while increasing our planned share repurchases, further demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. And finally, we're executing our 21st Century security strategy through improving capacity and resilience in the defense enterprise, accelerating the adoption and insertion of 21st Century digital technologies, and collaborating more closely with international partners and allies to improve security solutions. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned: I wanted to see if - just could I understand the F-35 situation a little bit more. Now the TR3 deliveries of F-35, those are now expected at some point in Q2 next year. But I think it's difficult for us to have like total confidence in that time frame. And what I'm trying to understand is as you continue to produce F-35s, which will need software upgrades before delivery, you're recognizing revenues on percent completion, so revenue should continue to be solid. But when you look at, say, a June delivery date, what's the impact on your production recognition of revenues, earnings and cash flow, should that date move around, how should we think about the timing here?
Jay Malave: So Doug, the timing on sales and the profits associated with the sales, the booking margin, I really shouldn't expect much variability with that. As we've mentioned, that really doesn't get impacted. What you could see and what we are seeing today is that our risk retirements are obviously dependent upon successful completion of the test program. And so that will - could limit our ability to take profit adjustments on a Lot 15 to 17 program. But as I've said in the past, we are performing and expect to continue to perform profitability stronger on Lot 15 to 17 than we did on Lot 12 through 14. And so we might see some short-term limitations on our ability to take profit rate adjustments, we still expect and have confidence will drive higher profitability on this contract lot than the prior one.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai Von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So Jay, I think recently, you made a comment about gravity on margins, and you haven't provided a guide for '24. But I think one of the issues that kind of you mentioned has been the classified missile program at MFC, where you have some LRIP options coming up. Could you maybe give us some color in terms of the status of that and how that impacts could impact next year? And any other items we should be watchful of that might exert gravity on margins? Thank you.
Jay Malave: Sure, Cai. Thanks. So yes, I mean, that's the question we've talked about. It's been a headwind. It's something that we've talked about for the upcoming number of years, including next year. And in fact, we are seeing some of the headwind this year, and it really - it's dependent upon an analysis really the timing of recognition of these losses. And there are certain things that need to be met from a performance standpoint on the program. And then it becomes an assessment on the probability of an option being exercised. And so there's just variability in that timing. It could be as early as, frankly, as this quarter, or into next quarter. What we could find ourselves in a situation is that we're recording multiple lots in 2024, which would put some downward pressure on next year's margins. So we'll have a better feel for that next year, and it could be in the range of anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points of headwind from where we are and where we end today or this year from a margin perspective. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color on the impact of that program. Is that - as far as any others, look, we - if you look at this year, we had lower profit adjustments this year. We expect there to be in the low 20s in 2023. We're evaluating what that means for 2024 in general. But again, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting the underlying business to be pretty much flattish, which would include recurring margins as well as profit rate adjustments in 2024.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. And Cai, it's Jim. Just to add on the classified program. First of all, given my Air Force filed experience, I can tell you that this is a really important capability for the country. It should continue on as an important capability for many, many years and even decades, assuming the program is successful, which we think we're on track to be and it will be massively NPV positive over that longer time frame. So we're working our way through the schedule and the performance in the early phases of the contract, but at the end of the day, it will be worth it for the country and the company. But we will keep you all updated as Jay just did on the path to get there.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So maybe an F-35 question. We've seen a lot of new countries express interest in the F-35 and current partners like Israel, have indicated plans to add to existing orders. What are your thoughts on expanding capacity to meet all the international demand? And is there demand from the customers to potentially bring forward their deliveries? And should you increase capacity, what level of investments?
Jim Taiclet: So Kristine, it's Jim. I'll start off and Jay can maybe speak to the required investment level. We're in sync with our Joint Program Office customer, which represents the international cohort indirectly of the F-35 customer base and directly the U.S. services. We've all settled on the 156 per year rate as the joint investment that we're all willing to make, given the demand that's out there. There is the annual sort of slotting priorities discussion that happens within the Joint Program Office and the international partners, and that will keep the line full for many, many years. If we were to get significantly more international orders that might motivate us jointly, and I mean us meaning the government and industry, including our suppliers, by the way to make an incremental investment. But I think that, that would have to be a significant increase in the order book above what we see today. So Jay, any other...
Jay Malave: Yes. I mean, the investments, it's probably in the low hundreds of millions. It's manageable. But again, to Jim's point, it needs to be coordinated with the customer.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Jay, on the F-35, can you discuss a little bit where we stood in the quarter in terms of sustainment revenue versus production because the decremental margin on the production was pretty high at 22%? And I'll sneak in one other one, which is in RMS, the implication is that you'd have a 14% margin in Q4 to meet your guide, yet revenues would be relatively flat. So if you can just kind of tell us what's going on to cause that to occur? Thanks.
Jay Malave: Okay. I'll start with the second one first on RMS margins and then come back on the F-35. On the margins for RMS, you're right, George, we're expecting an increase in profitability there. It's really a twofold function of higher profit adjustments. And there are - and I think I've talked about this in the past, we do have some mix benefits through some delivery - program deliveries here in the fourth quarter, which will give them some lift. As far as the F-35, just really from a sales perspective in the quarter, production was down pretty substantially, really close to 20%. Development was up quite substantially and sustainment was up in the high teens. So with solid there on sustainment, that's been strong all year long. We expect that to grow for the year around 10%.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein.
Jim Taiclet: Lois, are you still there?
Operator: Yes. One moment. We're opening his line. I'm sorry, the next person that we will go to is David Straus from Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning, David.
David Strauss: Jay, I think the IRS came up with some recent updated guidance around Section 174. I want to see what your interpretation of that was, whether it's supported your position or your peers that are taking, I think, higher levels of - or a higher associated with Section 174. And then any updated thoughts on where pension might come out for you guys next year given what appears to be much higher discount rates and weak asset returns? Thanks.
Jay Malave: Sure. Thank you, David. The first one on the R&D capitalization, the draft guidelines that came out, we view those as promising. We believe that they support our position of continuing to deduct the costs associated with cost plus contracts. And just as you remember, we treat that and view it as a cost of sale, not really as an R&D activity. The risk is really borne by the acquirer of those services. The rights are short-lived and they're also restricted. And so we believe the draft language is, at least thus far, appears to be consistent with our approach. And so we view it positively. As far as pension, a couple of things going on with pension, I'll go on the P&L. FAS pension will see a significant reduction next year. We're going to go from about $375 million of income in '23 to about $50 million of loss in 2024. It's a function of two things. One is the returns. And the second is essentially the expiration of benefits that we're amortizing since - from the 2014 salary plan freeze. And so those run out, and so we'll see a significant increase. As you know, that's pretty much noncash, but it will affect EPS. On the cash side of it, we'll see a little bit of a slight reduction anywhere between $25 million to $50 million reduction. But again, the biggest piece there is on FAS. From a cash contribution, we talked about anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion of contributions required starting in 2025. Right now, given where things are, we would expect that to be in the higher range, if not higher for 2025. And if we stay where we are, it could trigger some contributions in 2024. But I will say, when you think about cash contribution to pension and what that means, we've got an enviable position in our balance sheet. We've demonstrated that we're willing to use it. And so I wouldn't view that higher pension contributions as limiting, otherwise limiting our ability to continue our cash deployment strategies, and that's the key point.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ken Herbert: Yes, hi. Good morning, Jay and Jim. Maybe, Jay, just to follow up on a comment you made in the prepared remarks. I think you made a comment around the buyback activity in the fourth quarter sort of dependent upon timing of the fiscal '24 budget and whether or not there is a shutdown potentially. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the timing of the '24 budget, but very specifically, if there's any sort of shutdown, how much does that put at risk sort of the buyback activity expected in the fourth quarter? Or if it's very short, does that not impact me? Maybe you can walk through how you're viewing sort of the risks around that and impact on the fourth quarter cash deployment?
Jay Malave: Sure. So year-to-date, 0we've done $3 billion with this new guide at $6 billion, that's $3 billion in the fourth quarter. We're monitoring the status of the budget discussions and resolution of that. If we do find ourselves in a shutdown scenario, would cause us to take a pause in another relook at that share repurchase. And what we would probably do is just defer it, so it would be more of an issue of timing versus anything else until such time that the budget gets clarified. So history tells us, these things are fairly short-lived. We believe that we'll be able to get through it here in the fourth quarter. If not, then it would just push probably into the first quarter and the like and really won't see a meaningful impact there. But again, in a shutdown scenario, you just take a look at what does that mean. It does - you can't have new starts. It could be disrupted to programs. It could also put us in a situation where we're doing some self-funding to keep programs on track. And to the extent that occurs, it could be a limiting factor on share repurchase.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila's line did drop from the Q&A. So we'll move to Rob Stallard, and he's from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning, Rob.
Rob Stallard: A question for Jim or Jay. On the balance sheet, you noted that you're returning more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders at the moment. But we do have this ongoing U.S. budget uncertainty and you're going to put more money into the pension fund. So how sustainable do you think it is to be returning more than 100% to shareholders going forward?
Jay Malave: It's a good question. If you look at just the profile with this incremental authorization that we have, the way we're looking at it is $6 billion here in 2023, $4 billion in 2024 and then essentially $3 billion in '25 and $3 billion in '26, which puts us equal to free cash flow in that ballpark, assuming kind of a $6 billion placeholder offer free cash flow in those given years. And so that's the way we're viewing it, Rob. So over time, over the next few years, it will revert back to more of a 100% of free cash flow. But again, we'll look at it year-by-year. As you've seen in the last two years, we did increase it here in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they present themselves, the reality of what happens with actual pension funding, what progress we make in our working capital reduction initiatives and all those will go into the mix master and provide the inform what we formally do in any given year.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Thanks. Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning. How are you?
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Richard Safran: So if we take an optimistic scenario here on what happens with the budget outlook, I wanted to know if you could discuss the 2024 bookings and the opportunity set both classified and unclassified. Again, if we assume no shutdown and we assume to get funding, I'm interested in what the major competitions are next year is, what was - how you see backlog growth and the book-to-bill is better than 1?
Jay Malave: Richard, we've got a pretty decent line of sight to continuing growth in our backlog. There's a lot of activity happening in classified, which I can't speak to specifics about, but we do see some award decisions next year there. We'll continue to see orders strength in MFC over this time period. And we've talked about orders between 2023 and 2027 of $10 billion. We have not seen all of those orders come to fruition yet. So we would expect those to be continued opportunities for us. We'll continue to have F-35, so Lot 18 next year is probably something that we should probably consider coming into the backlog in 2024. In addition to the performance-based logistics program on the F-35 program, we've submitted our proposal to the customer. We continue to have dialogue. And we're cautiously optimistic that we can get under contract in the first half of next year. So those are some key awards to think about for 2024.
Richard Safran: Thanks.
Jay Malave: Welcome.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Can you guys hear me?
Jim Taiclet: Yes. We can hear you fine, Sheila. Good morning.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask Jim and Jay, you're a pretty confident management team just given your big backlog, $150 billion. You're returning 150% to shareholders, which is a big number. So you've talked about low single-digit growth and 11% margins for some time. So I just kind of wanted to know what's changed given the backdrop is seemingly better, is it just a budget uncertainty? Is it supply chain? Is it F-35? Maybe if you can just comment on that.
Jay Malave: Well, not much has really changed, to be honest, we talked about low single digits for a while now. We - I talked about that in my prepared remarks. On the margins, underlying margin is generally flattish because we could be in a situation next year where we have multiple lots of the classified program, that could cause some variability. But that doesn't fundamentally alter what we've been really talking about. Same thing with free cash flow. We've been targeting mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth. And we still see a path there. We know there are some headwinds, whether it's pension and the like, but we still believe that that we have a line of sight to be able to do that. And that's what we're going to be working through on a year-by-year basis since starting with 2024 over the next couple of months. We'll work through, solidify our plans, and we'll present them formally to you in January.
Jim Taiclet: In the longer term, there are some things that are changing significantly. One is the global threat environment and the geopolitical situations getting more concerning and challenging. That's refocusing the U.S. and certainly our allies around the world on national defense in increasing manner. The second big trend that's going on is the continued evolution of both physical and digital technology at a rate never seen before serving human history, frankly. And so the opportunity for our company to take the leadership role in integrating those technologies, whether they're hypersonics, hypersonic defense, space technologies that are advanced as well as 5G, distributed cloud, artificial intelligence, we're investing in all those technologies to try to drive them in and pull through using this 21st Century concept, the technology driving concept we have is to pull through our platforms and enable them quickly on the open architecture that we're advocating for that will be quickly and widely adoptable, making our platforms more compelling as we go forward in time. And then the third thing is the notion that we have international defense strategy, and I think our allies are increasingly embracing is international cooperation, which drives interoperability and also linking command and control systems, all of which comport with our strategy. So I think there are some megatrends that are going on over a longer term that won't necessarily affect us quarter-to-quarter as Jay was stating, but will give us opportunities that I think the company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of over that long term.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hi. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Jay Malave: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: Maybe, Jay, one quick housekeeping question and then one broader question for both of you. The mid-single-digit growth you talked about for free cash flow per share next year, did that assume any kind of pension contribution next year? And how big might that be or not? And then just more broadly, when you guys talk about seeking out additional suppliers of solid rocket motors, is that something for maybe developing hypersonics programs for late in the decade and into the 2030s? Or is that about replacing your suppliers on kind of today's existing programs? Thanks.
Jim Taiclet: I'll talk to solid rocket motors and Jay can take the free cash flow per share part of your question there. So our objective is to bring antifragility into our own supply chain first and to broadly apply that to the DoD in partnership with them as well. And so when it comes to solid rocket motors, I mean we're actually starting with GMLRS, for example, a legacy technology where we want to augment our existing supplier and have a dual source, frankly. And then that will extend into other systems, large and small and legacy in advance. So this is not a onetime objective. This is a broad, in a way, campaign like approach to strengthening our own supply chain and enabling multiple sources really for even beyond our company for our industry, which I think is important. So I do think that this is not a one-shot deal. We're in negotiations and discussions with a counterparty. We think we can start us off with on this journey, but it's going to be a long journey, and we'll probably have additional participants and programs as the years and even decades roll on.
Jay Malave: On the question of the free cash flow per share for 2024, Seth, what I mentioned is that we're setting up internal targeting and internal actions to be able to arrive at that incremental. Pension contribution would obviously put pressure on that. And we'll go through that over the next coming months and determine what the art of what's possible and what our plans would be, and again we'll present that in January.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Jay, a quick clarification and then a question for Jim. The clarification on the margins for next year, 25 to 50 basis points of risk, I guess, is what you're seeing on the MFC. Should we anticipate that there's a way around that? Or is that the base case? And then, Jim, in the press release, you talked about digital services revenue over time. And I'm just curious, maybe you could touch on your vision of what digital services revenue is today and where you want to take it over the next several years?
Jim Taiclet: So digital services will be a wide range, but we're starting with this notion of trusted, reliable mission systems engineering for command and control and battle management systems. That is a business we're already in, actually. It is largely digital already. And it's these kind of programs like Defense of Guam. We have a program in the UAE that's based on this technology as well called DIAMONDShield. We're using that core technology to then expand into other programs like AIR6500. So we're already in that business. It's in, I think, the mid-low to mid-single-digit billions at this point. And we're going to try to ramp that up in and of itself, add other technologies to that for networking, connecting again our platforms as well as other platforms from other OEMs to provide mission solutions for the DoD. So the digital and the physical technologies will ultimately come together in a way that can advance mission capability for our customers in, say, air-to-air combat, surface warfare, et cetera, and air and missile defense integration. Those kinds of missions, we want to advance every three to six months of the combination of digital and physical technologies of our own and from others, partners, etc., that we will work with. So this is, again, long-term broad approach, but we've already got a very, very good starting point that's material in the command and control and battle management systems that we have today and how we're augmenting them and modernizing those for the future.
Jay Malave: Okay. Going back to the question on margins for next year. Just as I mentioned, underlying margins, and let me for sake of clarity, margins, excluding the impact of the MFC program, we expect to be flattish. The MFC programs, it will provide a drag on the margins next year, and it's a question of timing. So it could be anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points. And again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we close out the year.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hello, everyone.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Jay Malave: Hi.
Noah Poponak: Jay, I guess I also wanted to ask about margins, and you sort of did there, but I don't know if you would just state where you expect the MFC margin to shake out for the year next year or what it looks like in the quarters with the more concentrated losses? And then I just wondered if you could talk about how - a little bit more about how this got here. I know you've talked about having the fixed price LRIPs here with prices fixed a little while ago. Was - is that something that's been going on longer than I realized? I know you - my understanding is you also no bid missile program that was awarded recently because it had fixed price development. Is the customer shifting the risk a little bit towards the contractor? Or am I overreading what I'm seeing out there?
Jay Malave: Well, let me maybe take the second part of it and then circle back. There are really two different programs. I think you're referring to the standard Stand-in Attack Weapon award, and that was a fixed price development program that we decided not to pursue because of the risk posture over there. And each program and pursuit really stands on its own, and we review those individually. In this case, we thought the risk profile was just too much. And so we backed off. On this particular program, on the classified program, that was a cost-plus development program. So there really was not much risk associated what the development cycle. There are these production low rate initial production lots that were priced pretty aggressively. And hence, we're starting - we're going to start to see the headwinds associated with that. As Jim mentioned, these are - this would be a long-term program. And we know what it takes to make sure that we provide accretive NPV on these types of programs. And so we track that and monitoring that, and we're confident over the long term, we'll be able to deliver that. So again, these are case-by-case type of situations that we pursue. On the - we'll probably have to get back to you on the specific MFC margins for next year. I think we can back into 25 to 50 on the total company, you can back into what that impact is for MFC. But I just don't have it in front of me.
Jim Taiclet: And Noah, just to give you context here, the approach we're taking no matter what the customer's initiative is on risk balancing or imbalancing, the approach that Jay and I are taking here, as we look at programs going forward and opportunities is really a holistic one where we do take the long-term total program value into account, but we also take - we'll take into account seriously short and midterm risk management. And especially when it comes to fixed price either development or initial rate production because if you look at the concept of fixed price initial rate production on a program, this technology is not settled in the first place yet because the development hasn't been done. We would ascribe a higher risk factor to that I think, going forward here based on both experience and just our own perspectives on these kinds of things.
Maria Ricciardone Lee: Okay. And Lois, I think we have time for one more as we approach the top of the hour.
Operator: Thank you so much. And that question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky: Yes. Good morning, everybody. Jim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the idea of a supplemental for Taiwan. I'm wondering if you would do us a favor, just kind of remind us of what you're shipping into Taiwan today. And in the context of a supplemental, what kinds of things do you think are going to be in high demand and would lead to more revenue for you all? And then Jay, related to international here, I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on the margin profile of your international business, kind of writ large today outside the F-35 program. If international is growing faster, is the expectation here that we would, all else be equal, see margin expansion in light of international historically being higher margin than domestic business? Thanks.
Jim Taiclet: Jason, on Taiwan, I think the signature program that everybody is aware of is F-16 in both production and modernization. So that's ongoing. But we also provided a kind of comprehensive defensive Taiwan, like Defense of Guam award we won last year, approach to integrating these digital technologies with the aircraft available that we provide and others, the missile systems that we provide and others and integrate them into sort of this porcupine approach to defending Taiwan just like we're designing for Guam. So there could be a wide range of digital and physical products that would come with this over time. The U.S. government will help define with the Taiwanese government, what, when if any of those will be procured and released for export to Taiwan to the FMS program and other vehicles. So I can't speak for the government as to what that will look like. But I think it's, again, a possibility that given the rising tensions there could be supplementals for Taiwan in addition to, as we said, Israel and Ukraine.
Jay Malave: And on the international margins, historically, the margins have been higher than they are for U.S. government customers. But in this case, it's so what I would expect the base business to continue this higher margin. But a lot of the incremental opportunities that we've been talking about are really going through foreign military sales contracting which are more like U.S. DoD-type margins. And so while we will see kind of a net blended margin profile that's probably higher than the kind of base U.S. DoD, it will be limited - at least the incremental business is going to be limited because they are FMS.
Maria Ricciardone Lee: All right. Great. Thanks, everybody. So I think we're at the top of the hour. I'll turn the call back over to Jim for some final thoughts.
Jim Taiclet: Sure. Thanks, Maria. I think before we conclude today, I do want to thank all of our employees around the world and across the country for their continued dedication. They're supporting our signature programs. They're going after new pursuits, advancing these digital technologies. And all that together will really enhance deterrents globally, especially in the more sort of dangerous world we live in. I want to really congratulate and thank our teams for everything they're doing. We also want to make sure that the shareholders are reminded yet again that everything we're doing here is designed to deliver a compelling value to you all for many years to come. Jay and I really focus on free cash flow per share, along with the dividend to make sure that you're getting an interesting return over time, and we're trying to expand the business as we go as well. So thank you again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you on our next earnings call in January. And Lois, that concludes the call for this morning. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conference, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-18 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Maria Ricciardone Lee: Thank you, Lois, and good morning. I’d like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today’s call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today’s press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today’s call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I’d begin today with a few key strategic and operational highlights and then Jay will discuss our quarterly financial results and full-year 2023 outlook. Starting on page 3 of this slide our Q2 financial results were strong, with sales of $16.7 billion up 8% year-over-year and double-digit growth at both aeronautics and space. Backlog reached a record level of $158 billion, up $8 billion from year-end resulting from a book-to-bill of $1.7 in the quarter. Orders included an approximately $8 billion option of [Indiscernible] for the 126 F-35 for production lot 17 as well as significant awards to ramp up emissions [Ph] at MSC. This highest ever backlog gives us visibility into multiyear sales of our key programs and enables our suppliers to be better positioned to meet growing demand. Segment operating profit of $1.9 million in the quarter reflected an operating margin of 11.1%. Free cash flow was $771 million and we remain committed to advancing technology and expanding production capacity. So in Q2, we invested $356 million of company funded R&D and $329 million of capital expenditures to address our customer’s needs and requirements. Meanwhile, we returned almost two times free cash flow to the shareholders. Given the strong results in the first half of this year, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 financial outlook. For sales we’re raising the midpoint of our range by $1 billion to revise expectation of between $66.25 billion to $66.75 billion and free EPS we are raising the midpoint of our range by $0.35, to revise the expectation of between $27 to $27.20 per share. We are confident in our ability to achieve these higher expectations and return to growth sooner than previously anticipated. Turning to the state of the defense budget, the outcome of the debt ceiling negotiations preserve top line defense spending at the President’s budget request for FY 2024. It also stipulated defense budget growth in FY 2025 while allowing for additional support through supplemental funding. The Embedded 3% growth in the proposed FY 2024 defense budget included funding for 83 F-35 aircraft with supplemental funding to support munitions investment that will enable us to ramp up production rates under new multiyear contracting authorities. While there are still numerous steps to reach final approval and funding for the FY 2024 budget, we’re encouraged by the strong support for our programs so far, and we look forward to the completion of committee reviews in the full appropriations process. On the F-35 program, we continue to see strengthening customer demand both domestically and internationally. The Czech Republic has expressed interest in the aircraft and Israel has formally decided to add 25 More F-35s, expanding their fleet by 50%. We delivered 50 F-35s in the first half of 2023, all of which were delivered and the technology refresh to or TR2 configuration. During the first quarter earnings call we indicated that in anticipated reduction to 2023 deliveries from what we initially thought last year, due to software maturation, acceptance and certification related to the Technology Refresh Three or TR3 configuration and hardware delivery timing. Our current view is we expected to deliver 100 to 120 F-35 aircraft in 2023. Importantly, there is no change to our longer term delivery outlook of 156 aircraft in 2025 in the foreseeable future, and the supply chain and production system continues to execute at a rate to support these future delivery targets. Our team remains fully dedicated to delivering the first TR3 aircraft in 2023. We have completed 58 flight tests on four different aircraft in the TR3 configuration, including a successful flight test for the most recent software release that happened in May. That software update brought in the next set of critical capabilities, such as upgraded data links, the new electro optical targeting system and radar. In the coming weeks and months, we will begin testing multi shift missions, sensor fusion, and additional weapons among other capabilities as part of the next software release. TR3 significantly updates core processing power and memory capacity, as well as modernizes the computational core of the F-35 to enable block four capabilities. It is a significant hardware and software upgrade that will greatly enhance the mission capability of the aircraft, which is on track to be the free world’s predominant fighter for many decades into the future. Meanwhile, we are continuing the long tradition of leading the development of the next generation of military aviation in this time, with both piloted and unpiloted aircraft and our Skunk Works operation in California's high desert. Skunk Works just celebrated its 80th year anniversary in June. That’s 80 years of pushing the innovation envelope from the year [Ph] to in the 1950s that continues to fly today to the Mach three plus SR-71 to pioneering stealth aircraft, and beyond by advancing hypersonic artificial intelligence and other revolutionary technologies. Skunk Works continues to create exciting feats of engineering and goes beyond the edge of known science for our customers. A prime example today that we can discuss is our partnership with NASA to develop and build the X-59, the prototype that will quiet the supersonic boom and lead someday perhaps to supersonic commercial flights over land. This elegant and amazing airplane is advancing a pace towards its first test flight. And our company’s pioneering spirit has lived even longer in the world of rotorcraft and helicopters. At the Paris Air Show, Sikorsky celebrated its 100th anniversary. Yes, 100 years ago, Igor founded Sikorsky aero engineering company on a chicken farm in Long Island, New York, with a small team of engineers and craftsmen, many of whom were immigrants like himself, who fled the Russian Revolution. In 1939, he brought his dream to reality when he piloted the first practical helicopter, the VS-300 as it left the ground for all 10 seconds. His passion for innovation and perseverance to achieve his vision carry on in the Sikorsky culture today and throughout Lockheed Martin. Sikorsky signature product line the H-60 Black Hawk family of military helicopters, also perseveres around the world. The U.S. State Department is approved a possible foreign military sale to Norway for 6 MH-60 Romeo multimission, helicopters and related equipment and Spain signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 8 MH-60R Seahawk aircraft as well. We achieve several milestones in the quarter in support of other NATO allies as well. The German air force successfully launched a PAC-3 missiles segment enhancement or MSC interceptor from a German modified launcher. This flight test was the last step before delivering PAC-3 MSC to Germany later this year. We also entered into an agreement with Rheinmetall Defence to collaborate on a unique rocket artillery system to be produced in Germany. And earlier in July, Rheinmetall selected a site in Germany to build a factory to manufacture F-35A center fuselages. This partnership, which was first announced in February between Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Rheinmetall expand supply chain capacity for the F-35. Production is expected to start with our new German partner in 2025. In addition, our relationship with Poland continues to progress with the first F-35 Lightning II for the Polish Air Force formerly entering production and the initial shipment of HIMARS launchers to Poland. The U.S. State Department also approved the multibillion dollar potential foreign military sale to Poland for PAC-3 with modernized sensors and components. On top of that, our partnership with Australia continues to advance as well. In April, as mentioned on our last earnings call, the Commonwealth of Australia selected Lockheed Martin as a preferred bidder for Project 9102, a sovereign military satellite communication system for the Australian Defence Force, we’re excited at the prospect of deepening our relationship with a diverse team of Australian companies and helping establish Victoria as the engineering and technical hub for Australian Defence. Also in space, Lockheed Martin will be taking on a major role in Blue Origin’s national team to develop and demonstrate a human lunar landing system for the Artemis program. Our Space Operations will be building humanity’s first Cislunar Transporter, which will enable recurring astronaut expeditions to the moon surface and back from NASA’s gateway space station. Finally, we continue to advance our integrated 21st century security digital technology architecture during the quarter. In May, as part of the U.S. Indo Pacific commands joint fires network, we successfully demonstrated Digital Command Control or C-2 to synchronize joint all domain operations during the northern edge exercise near Alaska. The exercise demonstrated the ability to successfully integrate with both Lockheed Martin and third party platforms and aircraft, including F-35s. The system performed C-2 functions across all the military services, all levels of operation and across multiple domains from space to air to surface. This is the first time Joint Force synchronization has been demonstrated at this scale. It was a major milestone for all joint all domain command and control interoperability, and our company’s vision for 21st century security. The results of this demonstration will help shape future JADC2 capabilities and continue Igor Sikorsky and Skunk Works pioneering legacy into the digital world. Also, as part of the northern edge exercise, the Lockheed Martin aeronautics and RMS teams demonstrated the first use of artificial intelligence capabilities on a stocker unmanned aircraft system for recognition and tracking of ships at sea. This capability showcase the value of using relatively cheap drones to greatly enhance the capability of and improve the survivability of much more valuable manned aircraft and ships. All these types of digital technology enhancements require reliable access to advanced semiconductors. In support of this crucial priority, I recently had the opportunity to join Global Foundries CEO Tom Caulfield and Senate Majority Leader Schumer to announce a collaboration that will advance us semiconductor manufacturing and strengthen resiliency within America supply chain. This partnership enables us to more quickly and affordably produce 21st century security technologies that increase deterrence for the United States and its allies, alongside Senator Schumer and other leaders and industry, Congress and the administration, we remain strongly supportive of the bipartisan chips and Science Act signed into law last year. The Lockheed Martin team will work closely with Global Foundries as we expand our critical manufacturing line in New York and with our semiconductor, other semiconductor and tech industry partners across the country to ensure access to made in America microelectronics for our platforms and systems. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions.
Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I’ll walk you through our consolidated results and business area performance for the second quarter of 2023. I’ll also provide an update to our full year guidance. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings released today. Beginning at chart 4, let’s take a closer look at second quarter results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Second quarter sales increased 8% year-over-year driven by aeronautics and space, both with double digit growth in the quarter. This growth partly benefited from last year’s $325 million impact from unrecognized F-35. sales. Excluding that benefit sales were up 6% year-over-year, with Arrow still up 12%. Segment operating profit was up 5% year-over-year, driven by the sales growth, which more than offset lower net favorable profit adjustments aligned to risk retirement timing. As expected, segment margins are 11.1%. Moving to earnings per share, on chart 5, on an adjusted basis, EPS was up 6.5% driven by higher profit and a lower share count partially offset by increased interest expense. Moving to cash flow on chart 6, we generated $771 million of free cash flow in the quarter with nearly $330 million of capital expenditures. On a year-over-year basis, our free cash flow included $330 million of higher tax payments from the R&D capitalization legislation. Once again, dividends and share repurchases exceeded free cash flow in the quarter, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. For the first half of 2023, we returned almost $2.8 billion or 137% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter we issued $2 billion of debt across three tranches for a weighted coupon of 4.8%. We had intended to raise the debt early in 2024 to support share repurchases, but accelerated the issuance to give us flexibility in coverage going into the debt ceiling negotiations. Okay, let's turn over to moving to the segment results. And starting with aeronautics on chart 7, second quarter sales at Arrow increased $1 billion driven by higher volume on the F-35, C-130 and classified programs. On F-35 we saw strong year-over-year growth in production and sustainment with some of the favourability due to the previously mentioned impact in the second quarter of 2022 to the lot 15 to 17 funding timing. Excluding that benefit aeronautics was up 12%. Operating profit increased 17% over the prior year based on the higher sales. As Jim mentioned, we were pleased that the joint program office exercise the next option, Lot 17 on the F-35 contract in the quarter. F-35 backlog now stands at 421 aircraft at the end of the quarter and offers longer term clarity for our production operations and provide stability to our supply chain partners. Looking at missiles and fire control on page 8, sales were comparable to last year as higher sales volume on tactical strike missile programs were offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. As expected, segment operating profit and margins were down year-over-year, driven by lower net profit adjustments. MFC increased the backlog by $6.5 billion in the second quarter reflecting a record $9 billion of orders in the quarter and a 3.3 book-to-bill ratio. The orders were increases were broad based across several of our key programs, including PAC-3, GMLRS. HIMARS, JASSM LRASM, and Javelin. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page 9, sales declined 3% in the quarter driven by lower volume on Black Hawk as the program continues to transition from multi-year nine to multi-year 10. This decline was partially offset by favorable volume across several radar programs within integrated warfare systems and sensors. Operating profit decreased slightly to the lower sales volume and net profit adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings. There were a few significant offsetting items that drove net profit adjustments down $40 million year-over-year. We recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $100 million in the Canadian maritime helicopter program, due to updated forecasts partially offset by a $65 million benefit on an International Airborne Surveillance Program. Turning to chart 10. In our space business area, sales were up 12% year-over-year, driven by continued development activity on a Next-Gen Interceptor and classified programs, with additional upside coming from Orion. Operating profit increased 15% and margins were up 30 basis points driven by the increased volume and higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance year-over-year. Now shifting to the outlook for 2023 on page 11. For the full year, we’ve increased our sales segment operating profit and earnings per share outlook, while also tightening the ranges based on our strong year-to-date performance. At a consolidated levels, sales are up $1 billion at the midpoint to $66.5 billion, allowing us to return a growth in 2023 earlier than previously anticipated, and segment operating profit is up $45 million at the midpoint to $7.35 billion. At the business area level, we’ve increased Arrow’s outlook for sales by $250 million, with profit of $25 million based on higher volume on F-35, sustainment and classified work at Skunk Works. As we’ve mentioned previously, we expect minimal impact to our cost throughput in 2023 as a result of the lower F-35 aircraft deliveries. And while we expect there to be some pressure on cash collections we are driving offset opportunities to make up any shortfalls. At space, we’re raising the sales midpoint by $750 million on higher development volume and the profit midpoint by $20 million, as the benefit from higher sales is partially offset by a lower ULA earning earnings outlook. Lastly, we’re maintaining our free cash flow guidance at or above $6.2 billion and remained committed to $4 billion of share repurchases with $2.7 billion in the back half of the year. We continue to expect that these repurchases along with dividends will generate a return more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. Looking at the 2023 earnings per share expectation changes on page 12 we’ve increased the EPS midpoint by $0.35, with the largest portion $0.14 coming from improved business area profit. We expect $0.11 benefit from a lower share count and we also expect the $0.06 benefit from a lower tax rate to 15% of or about 20 basis points. The remaining $0.04 comes from mix of miscellaneous offsetting items. Finally on page 13, and to summarize and close out our comments. Our first half [Ph] results were strong driving our return to growth a year earlier than anticipated, and leading to the increased outlook for sales, profit and EPS. Our backlog gives us confidence in our expected growth acceleration in 2024 and beyond. In addition, we remain committed to reward shareholders through industry leading dividends, and robust share repurchases. And finally, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives 21st century security and 1LMX in order to transform a business and extend our industry leadership, while delivering consistent and reliable shareholder returns. With that, Lois let’s open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] And that first question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Robert Spingarn: So, Jim and Jay, you both talked a bit about the strong backlog expansion at MFC and how that helps the second half of this year, perhaps a bit earlier than expected. I wanted to see if you could get into a little more color on how that drives 24 and beyond. And how sustainable this is? And then lastly, Jay, can the rising volumes on some of these legacy programs mitigate that margin pressure from the classified work at MFC?
Jay Malave: Sure, if you look at where we are, and maybe take us back to I think it was the fourth quarter call in January. I was asked about our outlook for 2024 growth and at the time, what I said was to expect a low single digit growth. And I think that that’s just right now we’re going to park there, although that’ll be on a higher base here in 2023 because 2023 is better. But we still need to go through and get a feel for what the site supply chain performance clearly with the backlog? It's not a question of demand; it’ll be a question of supply. And we need to go through that analysis over the next few months. And determine to what extent our growth outlook will change, if anything from this baseline of low single digit. And so if anything, what I would say the backlog gives us a lot of confidence that we are going to return to growth. The demand signal itself would indicate a higher rate than low single digit. But we need to wait and watch the supplies part of it to make sure that that can catch up to that demand. As far as the margin profile at MFC, we do expect there to be continued pressure over the next number of years. I would agree that some of the upside that we’ve seen in this incremental demand are from higher margin products and should provide some level of mitigation, but we will really get a feel for exactly what that means until again, as we go through this over the next few months as we understand specifically, what type what contribution each of these different programs will have in 2024 and beyond and what their timing will be and what that mixed benefit may be.
Jim Taiclet: And Rob, I can give you some long-term context here. So first, from a process perspective with the U.S. government. There’s multiyear procurement authority now for a whole set of sort of Lockheed Martin products, and I’ll just run through them really quick. It’s joint air ground missile, HIMARS, ATACMS, which is a longer range GMLRS for the HIMARS. PAC-3 MSC, the GMLRS itself, which is the you, get the HIMARS primary munition, Javelin, and LRASM and JASSM. So all of those programs have multiyear procurement authorities. And so far the GMLRS PAC-3 LRASM and JASSM are in pursuit of multiyear contracts with us currently already. And then, if you look at the corpus, the Ukraine supplemental, and what they’re targeted for, the overall amount has been $62 billion in four bills, the DoD regarding the Ukraine support, about two thirds of that or 44 billion is for the purpose of restoring the Presidential drawdown, for the train to security assistance initiative, essentially meaning the restocking of U.S. munitions. Now a lot of those munitions are going to be upgraded from what was in the stockpile, to the capability that we can produce today. So that’s another motivation for the U.S. to go through with that. And we’ve kind of derived at about 7 billion of those funds can be allocated at some of that Lockheed Martin programs that I just talked about. So there are significant long-term upside opportunities for our MFC business. And as Jay said, they’re fairly high margin and there’s increasing international demand for a lot of those products too. So I think it’s a really good long-term foundation for growth for the company.
Robert Spingarn: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Matthew Akers: Yes. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow up on the commentary on Tech Refresh 3. Can you just touch on the cash impact of that? How big was that, how were you able to offset that and kind of hold this year’s guidance? And then I guess is it fair to assume sort of additional deliveries above the 150 level for 2024 and sort of cash and benefits associated with that next year?
Jim Taiclet: Yes Matt so the impact on a per aircraft basis, around $7 million per aircraft. So if you go to, when we came into the year we were expecting between our range was 147 to 153. So you go for the midpoint there off for 150. 30 aircraft would be a $210 million impact and all the way down to 100 would be 50, about 350. So you’re talking between 200 and $350 million impact to this year. As I mentioned, we’re diligently working to manage that and offset it with tailwinds elsewhere in the portfolio. And to your point, to the extent that that does slip into next year, it’s really a matter of timing. So yes, it would as we deliver aircraft, to for those who slip into next year will recover those remaining payments that are upon acceptance of the aircraft in 2024.
Jay Malave: Yes, and just as a kind of to, again put it all in context, we can actually deliver more than 156 aircraft in 2024, because the factory is going to be producing at the rate of 156. So there’s some carryover, we might actually deliver more in 2024, then what the on-going run rate will be because the factory will still be performing, right while those aircraft are waiting to be accepted. I just want to make sure that everybody knows what we’re applying to this problem to make sure that we minimize it. And this is the same conversation that I’m having with the senior seniors in military and civilian roles in government. So first of all, we are not suppliers are applying all the needed resources to this, it’s a top priority for our company and few others as well. We’re running extra shifts, and we’re deploying subject matter experts into other companies or suppliers, operations to make sure this stays on track, flight test programs on schedule. And we’ve got the sufficient pilots, both in the company and in the Department of Defense, for acceptance, as we move forward on all of that. And then finally, the purpose of the flight test program is to base continuously narrow the funnel of testing of all the aircraft functions and mission capabilities in a really methodical fashion sort of narrowing a funnel. And so we’re just moving through that and methodical way. Our latest estimate is that’ll all be completed by the end of the fourth quarter this year. Could it move a little bit into early 2024? Yes, it could. But we think we’re on track to really get all the dimensions of resources, commitment, and schedule to give that option for the December delivery everything we can.
Matthew Akers: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yes, good morning, Jim and Jay. Hey Jay, thanks for all the color on the F-35. I was wondering just regarding like when we think about all the backlog growth you have now you’ve got a pretty big step up in CapEx this year, mid-teens growth? How are we thinking about just kind of supporting the backlog? Are you expecting kind of the CapEx profile to kind of level off here? Or are you expect that to increase and maybe also related to how you’re thinking about working capital in the same context? Thanks.
Jay Malave: Yes, on CapEx, I would definitely expect it to increase in the back half of the year. We’re still holding our forecast of $1.95 billion for the year. And we’re going to that’s going to essentially stay elevated for the next few years. So a lot of that is investment in capacity and production capability, as Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks. And so we expect that to return kind of remained fairly level. On the working capital side, that for us is a is a source of opportunity. We expect that to really to what we’re trying to do is take it back down to what we performed, from a day’s perspective over the past, say 2020 2021, and some period of 2022. And so, while we’re increasing volumes, you would expect working capital to increase as well. We believe there’s efficiency opportunities to perform at levels we’ve been able to perform in the past and make that at a minimum, not a use of cash. And if we’re fully successful, make it a source of cash in spite of growth. And so that’s our view, particularly the back half of the year as well as over the next few years.
Peter Arment: Appreciate that. Thanks Jay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Jim and Jay. Thank you. So maybe just some space given it drove your guidance raise. You know what drove the improved outlook, you called out 700 million of higher revenues related to development in space. Can you just give us a little bit of color there was that competitive win or any more detail on what was driving that?
Jay Malave: Yes, it’s just in many cases Sheila it’s earlier than anticipated ramps on some of the programs. So the first half, we ran higher than we expected. And we were expecting to run at those levels in the back half of the year. This includes classified programs, also protected communications, international security space business, as well as an NGINS [Ph] in our strategic and missile defense business within space. We’ve also had a little bit of growth in the Next Gen OPIR Program. And so all of those together, really drove the increase versus where we were coming into the year. And much of that we’ve really realized in the first half of the year with a little bit to come in the back half, but we had already planned ramping up those programs in the back half.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, great. Thank you.
Jay Malave: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rich Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Jim, Jay, Maria. Good morning. So there’s been a lot of press around the F-35. And an engine upgrade both during and after Paris. I just want to know if you could clarify your remarks a bit discuss where you stand on the new engine program. But also, I’d like to know what this kind of means for Lockheed and for the F-35. In general, since the engine as I thought was government furnished equipment.
Jim Taiclet: You’re absolutely right, Rich. This is Jim here. It’s government first equipments, a decision of the U.S. government as to what engine is selected for every block of aircraft and what modernization program goes along with that engine. So Lockheed Martin’s role and responsibility in this is simply to receive the engine performance data from the manufacturers, and their anticipated performance improvements, whether it’s a modernization or replacement option for the future. And then we translate that data to aircraft performance data and information that we then supply to our U.S. government customers. And then we are available to answer questions for their decision making process. So we’re not involved in that decision making process. And therefore, Lockheed Martin does not have a formal company position on engine selection or modernization. We implement that this U.S. government decision. And that’s what we’re doing now. So that is very clearly our role and responsibility. And anything outside of that is not an official company position.
Richard Safran: Thanks. Got it.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Jay Malave: Morning.
Noah Poponak: Jay. We’ve talked about this dynamic where the outlays have lagged the authorization. In the second quarter, outlays finally grew a decent amount, your revenue then grew at the fastest rate in a while organically year-over-year. I know in the back half, you have tougher comps. But the updated guidance and the revenue would have to be down in the back half organically. So I guess I’m curious to hear you talk about is the outlay to authorization gap going to keep closing, is supply chain or whatever else was impacting that resolved? And are you building guidance assuming that continues to close? Or would that create upside if it were to play out that way?
Jay Malave: We think no, the outlays will continue to increase it is just a function of us, we always have a back half is still higher than the first half. And that’s still the case here. When you look at our overall sales in the back half sequentially versus the first half, it’s about a billion dollars higher. And a lot of that is in aeronautics is going to be driving that. And so I would expect the outlays to continue to increase on an absolute basis over that period of time. The compares, it’s a function where our this year sales are more level loaded than they were last year. So we yes, we are having will have a step up and sales. But it won’t be as significant as it was a year later, or sorry, to last year. And part of that is if you recall last year, we had the $325 million in the second quarter that slipped into the third quarter in 2022. We also had a late award on the F-35 program that we weren’t anticipating in the fourth quarter. We were expecting that in the first quarter. And we’re able to convert pre contract inventory to sales immediately in the quarter. And so when you combine those that in of itself last year was about $500 million So when you normalize those for those things on much of a memorial level load here in 2023 versus 2022, it drives you to this. The compare just is going to be more difficult because on a year-over-year basis last year in the fourth quarter, partly for these reasons, we had 7% growth in the fourth quarter. So we won’t see that we will see the back half of the year organically declined, relative to the from a year-over-year perspective, but again, still putting us in a position to deliver growth a year earlier than we expected. It’s also just a function of our program timing. Yes, it’s still higher, but just we’re just not at the at the ramp up rate that we had in 2022.
Noah Poponak: Got it. And Jay pension on the cash flow statement, I think it’s been a bit since you’ve updated the beyond 2023 contribution and cash recovery. Could you give us updated numbers for that?
Jay Malave: Sure. For cash for cash contributions, we’re right now we’re anticipating that we would have a required cash contribution in 2025, anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion. As I noted earlier in the call, our objective is to really offset that really through three things. More net income, cash base net income and contribution. We’re going to see a tailwind in terms of dissipation of the R&D capitalization headwinds that we’ve seen. And it will also be driving working capital performance to a higher productivity level. So we can offset that our goal over this period of time is to continue to deliver a low single digit free cash flow growth on an absolute basis. And that combined with our share repurchase program, should result in a mid-single digit free cash flow per share growth. So that’s our objective, not over the next few years, really over a longer period of time as well. But that’s really where we stand right now on pension contributions, and how we’re planning for it.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Back in April, the DoD said the center fuselage production was the limiter to higher production on the F-35 above 156 per year. So with Rheinmetall, excuse me, now it’s signed up for fuselage is starting in 2025. Can you talk about the upside towards the end of the decade above the 156 level as Rheinmetall steps up to maybe 10% capacity?
Jay Malave: Well, that’s one important element miles of being able to expand past 156. But there are a lot of other elements that would have to be essentially funded between our suppliers, ourselves and the U.S. government to build the rate in the entire supply chain above the 156 level that we’ve all agreed on so far with the government. So if the demand continues for the aircraft, which it seems to be re-joining [Ph] continuously, and the U.S. authorizes export of the aircraft to either more countries or more in more in more numbers to existing countries, there might be a business case for the government and industry to go beyond the 156. The Rheinmetall center fuselage expansion will definitely be constructive to that, let’s say.
Myles Walton: And just a clarification, despite the lower deliveries, you haven’t slowed the production system on the F-35 on this TR3 issue, correct?
Jay Malave: No, we haven’t. So the whole production system, especially the long lead time parts, are tracking through the supply chain, as if we’re, going on our ramp up of between, 100, mean 140s, and ultimately to 156. The deliveries will be that of their delays, if there are delays of aircraft will be fully completed aircraft on the ramp waiting for not just not even the software load. But the confirmation that the software load they have for TR3 passed all the flight test points. And that’s really what they’ll be caught waiting for. There won’t be a production lag. There’ll be just a delivery lag based on the completion of the software integration testing that has to be done in the air on not only on the aircraft, but among numerous aircraft flying together at the same time. That’s they’ll be waiting for.
Myles Walton: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ken Herbert: Yes, hi, good morning, Jim and Jay. A two part question, if I could on the back hog. Is there any well, can you first help us understand how much of the backlog growth is maybe directly Ukraine related and is there any risk to this based on either sort of timing of the war or funding ultimately, going to allied partners and put in place for the obviously for the restocking. And then as part of the long-term agreement, you have in place on munitions and around a lot of this, how should we think about the potential margin positive margin impact from these longer term agreements?
Jay Malave: Let me Ken go to the with the backlog, much of the backlog particularly here, what we saw in the second quarter, were 20%, only 23 contracting requirements. There was something there was also GMLRS, which, which also included some 24 requirements. But, as Jim mentioned, we’re working towards multiyear contracting, but are not yet under any multiyear contracting agreements yet. And so, what we put into the backlog is pretty high confidence, it’s going to convert to sales. And so we’re continue to do it. As Jim mentioned, having a dialogue with a customer to the dry multiyear requirements beyond that. As far as the marginal in terms of long-term agreements, we essentially, many cases will enter into agreements with our supply chain, with over that period of time of these requirements, so we’ll go back to back with our customer. So as we enter into agreements with our customer, that will cover multi years, we will also get into contracts with our suppliers for those same multi year. So any benefits that we get from that probably is going to drop through to our customer in favorable terms and pricing. So I wouldn’t expect there to be any type of margin upside from where we are today. So I would expect consistent margins from those. But again, those are pretty solid.
Ken Herbert: Great, thanks, Jay.
Jay Malave: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky: Good morning, everybody. Jay, Jim, give you an opportunity to maybe offer up some comments on the other segments. Jay you’ve talked a little bit about low single digits, expectation and MFC. I mean if you could walk us through the other segments as we move out into 2024 and beyond and kind of your baseline assumptions for those at this point. And then also, maybe talk a little bit about margins, you made some comments during the quarter about the 1LMX initiative that you have going on, particularly around supply chain, and consolidating your purchasing and maybe getting some better purchasing power and pricing, and just kind of how that's informing your outlook for margins in the future.
Jay Malave: Okay, so just start with the growth rates and 24 and beyond. Just to make sure, I was clear, when I said low single digit, I meant for the entire company, total consolidated sales. MFC should be significantly better than that. And we would expect them to be our highest growth segment. And I’ll go from there. The others will see some growth from the remainders, but really, the driver will be MFC over the next few years, given this demand, incremental demand that we’ve seen. On 1LMX, on the margins, we’ve been, this is a initiative for us, which is very significant, it’s more than an ERP upgrade. It’s our engineering tools, product lifecycle tools, it’s our manufacturing execution system tools, it’s our customer relationship management tools, our HR system tools, and it’s intended to make or make us a more competitive company. Many of those benefits that we’re going to obtain, we will pass those through in pricing and our forward pricing rates to our customer. And so we won’t necessarily see some more our margin benefit from it. But it will make us more competitive to capture more business and stay in front of the industry and maintain our leadership. And so that’s the way we’re approaching 1LMX and a really more of a financial view of it.
Jason Gursky: So fair to say then, that margin outcomes will depend largely on mix going forward between development work and fixed.
Jay Malave: Yes, that’s I would say that’s, that’s accurate. The mix will definitely be a factor in, in future margins.
Jason Gursky: Okay, thanks.
Jay Malave: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks, good morning.
Jay Malave: Good morning, David.
David Strauss: Once we get an update on your position on section 174, see if anything’s changed there, based on feedback you might have gotten from any of the tax authorities. And then the second one, Aerojet Lockheed L-3s potential acquisition there of Aerojet I think recently you’ve been out to with some comments around just reviewing whether LHX has been able to or where they are in terms of being able to satisfy your concerns around that deal. Thanks.
Jay Malave: Sure. I’ll take the sections 174 question. In over the past, I’d say probably six months, the IRS has acknowledged that this is an issue they need to provide guidance to, we’re hopeful that we’ll see some guidance by the end of the year from them related to our position, there’s been no change in our position there. And so, what we eagerly await any type of guidance that they may have and still feel confident in the position that we’ve taken. And I’ve laid out in the past of why we’ve taken our position that we have today. There has been some legislation proposed that could defer the implementation of section 174 to 2026, it would be retroactive to 2022. So we’ve we’re optimistic, of course, we believe that it should be repealed. But at least a deferral would be a good start. And so we'll monitor that legislation. Obviously, we’re supportive of that. And we’ll see how it works through Congress. And then when it comes to Aerojet Rocketdyne, we have two interests and only two. And those are the reliable access to propulsion, especially solid rocket motors is critical of critical importance to the entire aerospace and defense industry. And so the two sided benefit that we need to preserve of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s current structure is that it’s a merchant supplier of propulsion to the industry. And that means it treats all of the -- I’ll call them prime contractors for the end products, the OEMs equally. And that’s what we feel we need to preserve, even if AJRD goes into the ownership hands of another company. Secondly, the performance of AJRD has been improving, but it needs to get significantly better nonetheless. And so whether it’s on its own or part of another company, it’s really important that resources be applied to AJRD’s operations, so that it becomes a more capable supplier for on time, deliveries, quality, etcetera. So those are our two interests, maintaining the merchant supplier status, and also having higher performance of the operations of that company. So we have not received any commitments from L3Harris at this time, that would assure us that they are going to keep AJRD as a merchant supplier. And that’s the one thing we really are looking for.
David Strauss: Right, thank you. That’s very helpful.
Jay Malave: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: Yes, hey, good morning guys. Maybe a broader big picture question here. As we as we look out to the fiscal 2024 budget, and what so what was in fiscal 2023? And the trajectory, maybe even, fiscal 2025. And 2024, it looks like there's going to be maybe 6 billion or so of spending on classified aircraft programs, everything from NGAD, F/A-XX. Now there’s been chatter about replacing U-2 with the hypersonic platform. I know you’re limited in what you can say, but can you just give us a feel for what kind of what that means for Lockheed Martin? How you think about it? And as outsiders kind of model this and think about it, how would you guide us to think about it?
Jim Taiclet: Well, I’d start with there Ron is that, we’re got and our experiencing significant growth in our classified portfolio already. It’s a bright spot for the company. I think recently, we’ve been when we aggregate all of our classified programs together sort of a 7% growth rate. So it is a place where because of Skunk Works, our space operations, some segments of RMS and MSC even where we have significant talent and capability to work in those kinds of really advanced spaces. I’d basically said in the prepared remarks, there are areas of this company where we are endeavoring to move into areas beyond known science to address what our customers kind of challenges are that they are facing. And so we have the capability to take advantage of a larger classified program growth rate on the part of government spending if that’s what happens. So we’re in good shape to do that. There are missions that you need to differentiate though when it comes to aircraft, right. There’s the reconnaissance and surveillance mission, right, which can a lot of it can be done with unmanned system. And that’s one of the strengths of Skunk Works for example. So that mission we have a real strength in unmanned surveillance ISR systems are called. Then you’ve got the air superiority type of aircraft, right? So you can think about F-15, for example, F-22. NGAD is the next generation air dominance aircraft that is classified. It’s the Air Force recently said that there is competition. Now beginning for that are in train for that air dominance aircraft that it was very old aircraft. And then there’s the kind of all-purpose strike aircraft, right, so that's F-16, F-35. Those kind of airplanes, again, where we have the advantage in F-35 is volume, right. We’ve got the committed volume for the strike mission. And basically all three variants, right, so it’s Air Force, which is a land base, long runway solution, it’s for the Marines, which is the B model, which is a land base, short runway, so a solution [Indiscernible] take-off and landing or carrier take-off or landing solution. And then you’ve got the C-model, which is the pure Navy, big carrier, tail hook type of landing aircraft. So the capacity for the strike mission, can and will be pursued through the F-35 and large part for the near future. So those are the ways to think about aircraft. So the classified programs are going to be largely in air superiority and ISR for the most part, and then there’s the bomber mission, which is largely going to be carried out by the B-21 Going forward. So hopefully, that’s a bit helpful to your question there.
Jay Malave: And just running. Overall, the over the entire portfolio, the classified business for us is around $8 billion. And if you recall, we talked about it being one of the four pillars of our growth projection all the way through 2027. And our highest probably will be our programs of record, given what we’ve seen, particularly with MFC. But that will be our second highest grow or anywhere between mid to high single digit growth through 2027.
Ronald Epstein: Got it? All right. Thank you.
Jay Malave: You’re welcome.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Yes, good morning. Can you can you just talk about labor availability and cost, just incrementally from last quarter. Has hiring become easier, just in terms of hiring people? And then also wage rates? Have you seen improvement there? Thanks.
Jim Taiclet: Yes, so we’ve actually, over the past six months, our labor availability has improved significantly. We have closed a lot of our key critical skill gaps over this period of time. And that partly has enabled the sales growth, the incremental sales growth that we’ve seen here in our change outlook, because part of that is just our own internal labor. And so we’re in a much better position than we were even six months ago. We’ve seen some lower attrition rates, as well as better hiring rates as well. And so we’re fairly confident that that will stick and that also bodes well for the rest of the industry, particularly supply chain. So we’re encouraged by that.
Pete Skibitski: Okay, that’s great. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you. If I want to go back to missiles and fire control in Ukraine for a minute, because if we think back to the early days of the Russia, Ukraine conflict, there were things like Javelin for you there was of course, stingers, everything looks like it would be kind of a short term need, potentially building out some capacity for replenishment of weapons. And so now we are more than a year later into this. And you’ve gotten some very big awards in this last quarter, that appear to be related to Ukraine, either directly or other European needs. We’re seeing NATO spending go up. Can you talk about how you view the opportunity and missiles and fire control for revenue and, and backlog? I had, depending on how things may play out in Ukraine, from if we saw, the conflict come to a resolution or if we had increasing NATO involvement, how do you think about that in your planning?
Jim Taiclet: So I would say qualitatively and maybe turn it over to Jay for some quantification around it is that the tragedy of Ukraine has unveiled some issues and weaknesses for our national defense enterprise more broadly, right. And so I’m not convinced Doug that the duration of the Ukraine war which we hope is very short, will affect our long-term prospects for MFC. But the lessons from this conflict will, will remain for many years. And that’s what I think is most important. And the lessons are that great power conflict, first and foremost, unfortunately, is not gone from the world at this point in history. Russia’s decision to invoke a major power land war on the European continent was pretty risky, and demonstrates that they may take other risks in the future to mate, sustain its regime or to expand its power, whatever the case, and the motivation may be. So NATO then, and when you talk to the defense ministers of countries like Poland and Lithuania, they are taking this extremely seriously, not for the short term, but for the long term. And so they are expanding their defense budgets not because of what’s going on necessarily in the on the ground in Ukraine right now. It’s for the elevated risks that they perceive to their own countries for some foreseeable future. Sadly, when it comes to the United States, the lesson, among others of this situation in Ukraine, unfortunately, is the expenditure rates of munitions is much higher than most of our existing war gaming models would imply. And therefore, there’s a replenishment need for what’s been used and what’s been shipped to Ukraine. But beyond that, is the planning and hopefully, deterrence of future conflicts where the U.S. and its allies are going to need to, first of all demonstrate to a potential adversary that they have the stockpiles, to defend themselves for a long period of time if need be. And that the rates of munitions usage will be supportable from their stockpiles and from their industry. So we think this is a longer term, essentially, sea change in national defense strategy for the U.S. and for our Western allies, including Japan and the Philippines and others. So we hope the conflict in Ukraine ends quickly. But the lessons and the future demand for these kinds of products is going to stay elevated for a very long time, we think.
Jay Malave: And that appears consistent with the nature of these recent orders you’ve gotten that are large quantities extend over work over a longer period of time than we might have thought.
Douglas Harned: Right.
Maria Ricciardone Lee: This is Maria. I think we’ve come to the top of the hour here. So I’ll turn it back to Jim for some final thoughts.
Jim Taiclet: Just a couple of things. I wanted to make sure everybody understands that we’re up to what I now think is a great start after three years of launching our 21st century security, concept and strategy. It was really originally around include proving and increasing deterrence to conflict by accelerating the adoption of digital technologies like 5G, distributed cloud, AI, international defense. And I think we’re making huge progress on that. We’ve got a great set of partnerships with tech companies large and small to help us do that, and the customer starting to adopt it. And as I talked about the repair to prepared remarks, remarks, we’re showing the major exercises, and we’re getting some actual revenue and Program Awards around that. But we’re going to expand that concept into two arenas based on this experiences we’ve had in the last two or three years. The first one is to build and strengthen the defense production supply chain based on some of the things you just talked about. We’re going to have to have a more resilient defense production system and one that can scale quickly if we have to. And then the other dimension is to make international production and sustainment operations a part of at least Lockheed Martin’s future. And you see, you hear us talk about investments in Australia, the U.K., potentially, Poland, Germany is new in this for us. So we’re going to continue to expand internationally to make sure we have resilient supply chain, and we have sustainment operations where our customers can use them to deter future conflict around the world. So those are some of the things I think is really important for you all to understand where we’re headed. But before concluding the call, I really would like to thank all my Lockheed Martin teammates, for their many important contributions to strengthening our national security and increasing deterrence. And the strong financial and operational performance that we’ve been experiencing in this quarter was a result of their dedication, hard work and look, whether it’s on the factory floor or classified engineering facility or customer flight line our people showed up every day during the pandemic to do the job and they continue to show up every day to do the job to provide for national security. So I want to thank them and also thank you all for joining us on our call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next call in October. Lois, that concludes the call.
Operator: Thank you and ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-18 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Ricciardone Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Maria Ricciardone Lee: Thank you, Lois, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to Lockheed Martin’s first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'd like to begin today with a few highlights from the quarter, as well as an overview of the Presidential Budget Request and then Jay will discuss our financial results and full-year 2023 outlook in detail. We had a solid start to the year with first quarter sales of $15.1 billion led by 16% year-over-year growth at space. Segment operating margin was 11.1% led by MFC at 15.8%. Free cash flow grew 11% to $1.3 billion and combined with the lower share count contributed to a strong free cash flow for share growth year-over-year. We remain on track to meet our financial expectations for the full-year and the return to growth in 2024 as we laid out in January. In terms of capital deployment, we returned $1.3 billion or 101% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the quarter. We remain focused on our long-term strategy of growing free cash flow per share and continue to plan to deliver approximately 110% of our free cash flow to stockholders in 2023 through dividends and buybacks. Turning to the budget. The administration released preliminary details of the FY ‘24 President's Budget Request or PBR in early March. This budget proposal reflects a heightened emphasis on defense and security cooperation with allies. The FY ‘24 DoD budget request is $842 billion an increase of $25 billion or 3% over the FY ‘23 enacted funding. The near peer threats posed by China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is driving the national defense strategy and has created added demand for Lockheed Martin's advanced effective solutions. Key highlights include the procurement of 83 F-35 aircraft continued expansion in classified programs and an increase in requested funding for munitions. The PBR also includes facilitation investment and advanced funding for long lead time parts in support of multi-year procurement of JASSM and LRASM. We're also engaged with DoD on multi-year procurement proposals for PAC-3 MSE and guided multiple launch rocket systems. These proposals are subject to congressional approval during course of the FY ’24 defense authorization and appropriations process. The PBR also includes continued investments in key technology development efforts such as conventional prompt strike, long range Hypersonic weapon, next generation interceptor, Hypersonic defense, bomb defense system and other space programs. Furthermore, key technology areas aligned with Lockheed Martin investment priorities received increased funding to include microelectronics, 5G technologies and joint all domain operations. We are encouraged by this initial request and look forward to its progression through the authorization and appropriations process. We also anticipate heightened emphasis on national security prioritization from Congress, supplemental spending requests including Ukraine and elevated demand from allies and partners. Turning to the F-35 program, the 83 F-35 Lightning II aircraft included in the PBR signaled strong support from the services and the administration. Moreover, the Canadian government's January announcement that it will procure 88 F-35s marks another milestone in continued international demand for the aircraft. As to production, deliveries of F-35 engines which are government furnished equipment resumed in February. And then flight operations and deliveries resumed in March. However, we do expect a fraction of total expected 2023 deliveries to be impacted later this year, due to both software maturation related to Technology Refresh 3 or TR3 and hardware delivery timing. However, we anticipate little to no revenue impact from any potential delivery delay and therefore no material adverse effect on our 2023 P&L. Jay will provide some more color on this in a moment. Also at Aeronautics, the first Greenville built F-16 Block 70 took flight and was delivered to Bahrain. In addition to the Bahrain customer six countries have selected Block 70 or 72 aircraft and Jordan and Bulgaria have signed letters of agreement for additional jets. Further related to the F-16 in the quarter, while I was at the U.S.-India CEO form in March, I had the privilege to announce the memorandum of understanding with the Tata Lockheed Martin Aero Structure Limited joint venture to produce F-16 wing structures in India demonstrating our commitment to India as an industry partner and customer, while bolstering our supply chain. Turning to Hypersonics, it is encouraging to see the continued investment outlined in the PBR for the conventional prompt strike weapon system or CPS. As it begins integration and testing for Zumwalt Class Ships recognizing our advancements in this critical technology. In February, the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Martin an initial contract for CPS, the first sea based hypersonic strike capability for the United States. Enabling long range missile flight at speeds greater than Mach 5. First delivery is expected by the mid-2020s. Regarding our Air launch rapid response weapon also known as Aero, we are continuing testing of the system at hypersonic speeds in order to advance technical maturation of the missile and the glide body and to ensure the final product is safe, reliable and supportive of our customers' missions and future plans. In January, we also completed the second flight test of hypersonic air breathing weapons concept also known as Hawk in partnership with DARPA and the Air Force Research Lab. We accomplished all the test objectives during the second flight test, including affordable rapid development and performance requirements. And in late March, the U.S. Navy announced its support of the hypersonic air launched offensive anti surface strike weapon or HALO. Lockheed Martin was down selected and awarded a contract for the first step to fielding a critical capability over the next decade and begin the design and development of a carrier based air breathing hypersonic strike capability for the Navy's fleet. As a company, we remain fully committed to developing hypersonic technology on accelerated timelines to meet this critical national security need and establish a solid deterrent posture in this area for the U.S. and its allies. The hypersonic solutions are just one element in our vision of 21st Century security. We advanced several additional aspects of this strategy during the quarter, including announcing a memorandum of understanding with Juniper Networks to jointly develop integrated hybrid software defined wide area network solutions and to demonstrate that with our customers in the future. This technology enables Mission Aware Dynamic Routing, a foundational capability for resilient joint all domain operations. This mission where dynamic routing shifts the movement of data and communications in real time across a mix of military and commercial infrastructure according to evolving conditions. Our solutions give customers the flexibility to rapidly adapt to maintain the flow of crucial data and information as their assets operate in contested environments. We also led simulations of technologies to the U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy to demonstrate the impacts of 5G communications and advanced analytics to significantly improve operations and maintenance performance for a variety of aircraft, as well as for unmanned platforms and operationally challenging environments. And at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, I had the opportunity to deliver a keynote address and meet with CEOs across the digital technology, mobile and networking industries to encourage us working together to promote innovative solutions to protect our countries and advance our space exploration capabilities. Another example of our leadership in accelerating advanced 21st Century technologies to improve national defense and deterrence to conflict is in the arena of directed energy. Recently, our RMS unit achieved success in our initial test of our demos. High energy laser, which verifies that the laser's optical performance meets the system's targeted design parameters. This 50 kilowatt class laser weapon system aligns with the Army's directed energy, short range air defense mission. In addition to delivering on absolutely cutting edge technologies, demand for many of our well-known and long-time high performing systems continues to be strong. For example, in January, the Australian government announced the purchase of 20 Lockheed Martin high mobility artillery rocket systems or the now familiar High Mars, providing Australian defense force with a reliable, well proven capability. And we continue to grow our significant partnership with Australia beyond High Mars. In February, an agreement was announced between the Australian and United States governments for a foreign military sale of 40 UH-60M Black Hawks for the Australian Army and deliveries are slated to begin early this year. The Black Hawk remains unmatched as an all-around, multi role durable military helicopter for Australia and for the 34 other countries around the globe that use it. Further, we're excited to work with the ADF and Australian industry to develop their sovereign satellite communications component, otherwise known there as joint Project 9102. The Commonwealth of Australia announced in April that Lockheed Martin was selected as the preferred bidder for JP-9102. This multibillion dollar project will provide the ADF with a robust solution for military satellite communications and defined by its versatility and its resilience. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions.
Jay Malave: Thanks Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated and business area results for the first quarter and cover our 2023 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart three and an overview of consolidated financial results. Overall, 2023 is off to a solid start, positioning us well to meet our commitments for the year. We delivered just over $15 billion in sales with $1.7 billion in segment operating profit, resulting in 11.1% segment operating margin. Earnings per share was $6.61 and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, enabling a solid shareholder return to share repurchases, and dividends. Our book-to-bill ratio for the first quarter was 0.7 as anticipated. With backlog expected to increase in the second quarter, from the upcoming order for F-35 Lot 17 production. And we continue to strategically invest in our growth strategy with $600 million of capital expenditures and independent research and development this quarter. These financial results are on track with our expectations for the year. Taking a closer look at the quarter's results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit on chart four, first quarter sales increased year-over-year by 1% as space led the way with 16% growth. Segment operating profit was down 2% as lower ULA equity earnings and contract mix more than offset the benefits from slightly higher volume and step ups. As expected, margins contracted mostly due to the lower equity earnings from ULA. Moving to earnings per share on chart five. GAAP earnings per share were up $0.17 or 3% over 2022. Adjusted for mark-to-market investment gains, EPS was flat. On an adjusted basis, the unfavorable year-over-year impacts from segment operating profit, interest expense and FAS/CAS pension income were offset by the lower share count. Moving to cash flow on chart six, we generated nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, including nearly $300 million of capital expenditures, as well as over $600 million of accelerated payments and continued support of the supply chain. Our cash deployment plan is on track, which we expect to accelerate throughout the year. In the quarter, we had $500 million of share repurchases and paid almost $800 million in quarterly dividends. Total cash return to shareholders in the quarter was 101% of free cash flow. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on chart seven. First quarter sales at Aero decreased 2% year-over-year. Lower F-35 production sales were partially offset by higher F-16 and classified program volumes. Operating profit was slightly lower than prior year as the impact from lower net profit adjustments and sales volume was partially offset by favorable contract mix. For the year, we expect F-35 deliveries to be lower than previously anticipated due to software maturation with the Tech Refresh 3 program and hardware delivery timing. We will refine the impact as the year progresses, but do not expect the change to Aero’s 2023 sales and profit ranges that we had previously communicated in January as we maintain our production cost throughput profile for the year. Looking at Missiles and Fire Control on page eight, sales decreased 3% as lower sales volume on sensors and global sustainment, as well as our tactical strike missile programs were partially offset by growth in integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit was down 2%, driven by lower sales volumes and net profit adjustments, partially offset by favorable contract mix. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page nine, sales were down 1% from 2022, driven by lower volume on Black Hawk production and our C6 ISR programs. These declines were partially offset by favorable volume on radar programs and integrated warfare systems and sensors. Including Defense of Guam, an important growth area for RMS that was won in 2022. Operating profit decreased 14%, due to lower sales volume and timing of net profit adjustments. Turning to chart 10 and our space business area. Sales were up 16% in the quarter driven by strong growth on the next gen interceptor and classified programs and further boosted by favorable program lifecycle timing on Orion, protective communications, and fleet ballistic missile programs. Operating profit was up 13%, driven by the increase in volume and favorable profit adjustments partially offset by the lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Okay. Now shifting to the outlook for 2023 on page 11. For the year, we are reaffirming guidance for all key metrics. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $65 billion to $66 billion with segment operating margin at 11.2% at the midpoint. We also still expect to deliver free cash flow at or above $6.2 billion, while repurchasing $4 billion of outstanding shares. We believe our first quarter results position us to achieve these expectations as we continue to add orders, we program execution commitments and pursue new opportunities throughout the year. Right, so let's close on page 12 to summarize with the comments. As noted, first quarter represents a solid start to 2023. We reaffirm key financial metrics as previously guided and continue to expect a return to growth in 2024 and beyond. With consistent free cash flow per share growth. Looking ahead, our strategic focus on 21st Century Security Solutions aligns with expected increases to defense and security spending. With our continued discipline and focus on execution, we are on track to meet our expectations for long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Seth, I'm sorry Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, I apologize and I'm losing my voice a little bit here. But Jay, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the GAO report would indicate that Sikorsky’s bid for FLRAA was about 45% of that of Bell? And so it seems like investors are, kind of, fortunate that Sikorsky did not win that competition. And I guess what can you say to investors, you talked about some of the classified missile profitability headwinds, I know there was a charge on CH-53K, some ULA development that, kind of, the bid process is consistent with generating adequate returns on new work?
Jay Malave: Great question, Seth. Let me just say on FLRAA. We're obviously disappointed. We believe that our offering was the best technology to support the multi-mission requirements at the best value. And while we'll acknowledge that the proposal did include aggressive pricing, a significant amount of our offering included efficiencies made possible by the benefits of 1LMX. And our adoption of 1LMX model-based and digital thread enhancements significantly improved our cost competitiveness and we expect that to continue in the future. The business case itself was favorable and that's what enabled the pricing that we were able to offer. As it relates to -- I think generally speaking, that's how we evaluate these proposals. We look at the NPV, we look at IRR, we looked at all different metrics, we look at current affordability. And as I mentioned at your conference Seth, I've said it, in a classified program at MFC, we have to take a little bit of short-term pain for some long-term gain. But the fact of the matter is the business case does provide that long-term gain for us. And so, we go through all of that as part of the management decision making, the technology that we can provide. As you would expect, we have the leverage, we have the capability of wherewithal to provide favorable pricing in outstanding technology offerings to our customer, and we don't do it at the expense of financial returns. Let me just add, just on the CH-53K, we did have something in the press release. There was a small adjustment related to a development contract -- an older development contract, there was no adjustments taken on the forward production agreements that we're working on currently.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: Thanks, good morning, Jim and Jay. On the F-35, the talk of the performance-based logistics deal has been ongoing for some time. But it seems like it's possible you would reach a deal this year? So, could you give us an update in terms of where you stand in transitioning over to a PBL contract in the program? And then assuming that PBL meets conditions set by the 2022 NDAA, how could this impact the sustainment work and the overall program profile over the coming years?
Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Kristine. It's an excellent question. We did estimate a proposal, we are expecting that to be decided by the end of the year and awarded. And we think this is the best solution for the customer, not only over the next five years, but frankly, over the -- this is the right program for the life of the program. And what this offers is really a win-win type of solution. It enables us to utilize our proprietary modeling for material requirements to most efficiently use inventory and provide real-time availability of material to our customers as they need it. And so, we're able to take that responsibility off their shoulders, being able to provide them the requirements when they need to maintain, obviously, the readiness levels that are necessary. And so overall, not just over the next five years, we think it's the right long-term solution for our customer. And we think again, it's just a win-win proposal for not just the joint -- the services, but also industry as a whole.
Jay Malave: And Kristine, we think we're on a path to establish a PBL with F-35 customer enterprise this year and that's what we're tracking too.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rob Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Rob Stallard: Jim or Jay, now that you actually mentioned supply chain issues or labor shortages or other things in your commentary, so I was just wondering if you could give us an update on that situation and whether things have improved?
Jay Malave: Yes, it's a good question. Rob, our visibility we’re going throughout the year, and I made a few comments -- I think the public comments in the quarter that we're looking at potentially at some shortfalls and partly that was due to the strong performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, the supply chain delivery, I think for the most part, there are still some pockets that we've seen particularly where it was impacting the most was at MFC and RMS, both of them had some continuing lingering issues that continue to plague us. On-time delivery performance really didn't get any better from Q4 and really what we saw in the back half of last year. So as we expected, really going back to when we reset expectations in the second quarter of 2022, we're really not expecting any type of significant recovery to the end of the year as we go into 2024. So, essentially more of the same in the first quarter from what we saw previously.
Jim Taiclet: And Rob, it's Jim. We're on the cusp of fully implementing really best practices in supply chain across this one Lockheed Martin concept that we have now, used to be that each business unit here or business areas, we call it, did its own supply chain management. And then within programs, it was even more narrowly managed. And so, we're now bringing all the aggregate demand together for each supplier across all of Lockheed Martin from space to MFC and everything in between. And then, we're also looking at components that programs are using in different parts of the company from mid-tier suppliers and aggregating that demand to actually synchronizing our requirements and so that we can have more and more bulk buys everything from raw materials up through mid-stage components, et cetera. So, we're implementing those, kind of, best practices that will be good for the supply base too. I don't have more reliable demand from our company in total and I think will lead -- I hope will lead the industry into that future, where we help strengthen the supply chain by our practices in addition to their improvements.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thanks so much. So, Jay, you had very strong profitability at MFC 15.8% was up and yet you talked of this classified missile program hitting, I think 50 bps to 100 bps on margins. Can you update us in terms of -- is that still what the number is given the strength in the first quarter and how far out into the future does that extend? And then maybe more broadly, Northrop also mentioned, maybe on B-21 that they have some fixed-price exposure looking out, do you have any other programs where we should be aware of potential, you know, LRIP or fixed price options on programs out in the future?
Jay Malave: Okay, thanks, Cai for the question. Let me just address specifically MFC they had -- did have a strong quarter. If you look throughout the year, where we go from here. In the quarter, they had essentially the highest profit adjustment quarter they're going to have, and so that's going to a step-down in the balance of the year. Secondly, we will see more of an impact from the dilutive margins associated with this classified program in the back half of the year as well. And so I would expect in a step-down in the 13% range in Q2, it will cycle down from there, we're still expecting the full-year to be in this 13.5% range really due to these two items. The step-up with profit adjustments will be lower for the balance of the year and the dilutive impact, it becomes more profound in the back half of the year. As far as other fixed-price production programs we’re really -- that's pretty much the large one that we're tracking. We've had the program at Aeronautics, that -- we took a charge in 2021 and we continue to monitor that program, it's fixed-price development. We still have multiple years of development on that program, and so and that's one that we continue to keep an eye on. But I think, Greg Ulmer and his team are really managing that and laser-focused on driving to the customer’s requirements in meeting their schedule and doing it when the cost objectives that we have currently laid out. Just going back to the MFC in terms of the outlook, we're going to be pressured on margins, probably for the next four to five years and predominantly from this program. It'll step up, it'll probably peak out in 2025 and then stabilize from there. The question -- other question I've been asked on MFC is whether they can grow absolute profit and the answer to that question is yes. And so while we may see some dilutive impact to margins, we may see profit maybe be flat from one year to another. Overall, over the next four to five years, we will see profit grow at MFC. And so, those are pretty much the answers to your questions. Thank you, Cai.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning, guys.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Ron Epstein: A question for you -- maybe a bigger-picture question. Now Secretary Kendall was out without talking about NGAD and kind of restructuring that program so that more of the IP is owned by the DoD and having the constant re-competition of contractors and so on and so forth? How does that factor and how you think about that business model, does that really change anything? And I don't know if you could, kind of, speak about that?
Jim Taiclet: Ron, it's Jim. If we're constantly and have over the years, the company's history worked with government on intellectual property, management rights, et cetera. We'll continue to do that and got itself is a concept in progress, I'll call it. The government services, DoD et cetera, they are formalizing and crafting with NGAD is going to look like and then what NGAD stands for is Next-Generation Air Dominance aircraft. So, think F-15, F-22, that kind of class airplanes [Indiscernible] win air-to-air combat. And so, there'll be a mix of -- may accrued and uncrude vehicles in that concept, that's still being formulated. We're working with government through our Skunk Works operation on what the options are there. We'll sort out the intellectual property rules as we go forward. But frankly, we're driving and advocating strongly for a more open architecture approach to the entire industry, unless proprietary standards and protocols and architectures and we just demonstrated one of those with the docking mechanism for spacecraft, which can be basically implemented on any -- a wide range of spacecraft to do future replenishment of either data fees or fuel et cetera to satellites inflate. So those are the kinds of things we're advocating for and we will always guard and protect our intellectual property rights for the IP that we develop and we'll work with customers to create the open architecture, so that we can continue to compete effectively.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, everyone. Jim, I was just wondering if you can add some more color on sort of where Lockheed stands with Hypersonics just in light of the changes made to Aero and your Hawk variant. Obviously, CPS looks good, I don't know how big that could be, but could you walk us through maybe where you're at today in Hypersonics and with the program changes where things could go? How big you could get? Thanks.
Jim Taiclet: Sure, I'll take the construct and then offer Jay, the opportunity to, kind of, give you some scoping of where the business side of it could go and revenue growth et cetera. But Hypersonics is a -- it's a complex endeavor. You can, kind of, build a matrix in your mind, right? There's two different kinds of propulsion technologies, right? One is air breathing, so think a cruise missile type of vehicle where the -- there's atmospheric provision of oxygen going through inlet docked and it's aiding the propulsion system to continue forward. The other technology for propulsion is called boost glide, it's more like a kind of space rocket almost, and the fact that it's got either solid fuel rocket or equivalent to that. It gets a big boost off the launch vehicle or the Launch Pad and then the vehicle ultimately separates the glide body, it's called with the warhead from the rocket and on it goes, by it's basically momentum, it's already been provided from the boost. So, everything is one whose glides another, those are the two propulsion technologies. And then there are notions about the source of the launch, right? So, you could have ship based which is CPS, you can have land-based off of Tell vehicle, Transport Director, a launcher vehicle that the Army calls long-range hypersonic weapon or you could launch this often aircraft. And that's the matrix you have to go on your head, what proportion are we talking about and what launch platform, we're speaking about? So, let's just go really quickly through each of those. So ground based right now, there's essentially the long range hypersonic weapon is the game in town, it’s very similar to the CPS, which is the ship-based vehicle. Its boost glide and it could be see it’s surface launch seer or ground. That is where the government is placing its bet is on that joint program CPS and long range hypersonic weapon. You pointed out that we have that contract right now or executing on that for both services. Then when you get to Air Launched, you have the two propulsion systems, so Hawk and HALO are the air breathing, air launched vehicle, right? That the air launched vehicles have a size concern that you have to take into account. So what airplanes can carry such a product or such a weapon. The boost glide is a heavier larger vehicle, which we have been testing through the Aero program, and it's going to be a matter of what aircraft, the air force and ultimately the Navy want to use to bring the hypersonic weapons that they will have into the battle. And that's the debate and discussion that’s going on in the services. That's the way to frame all this. Those are all government decisions. We're supporting really all of the matrix if you will at this point with either development program like Aero or production program like CPS. So I'll stop there and give Jay a chance to, kind of, give you some scope on what the growth for the company could be.
Jay Malave: Sure. It's -- today, it's about a $1.5 billion business for us in the aggregate, all of those programs that Jim mentioned. We expect that to continue to grow and be a contributor. It's one of our growth -- four growth pillars, it's not the largest because it's smaller than some of the other contributors. But it still provides healthy growth and there's upside to that related to hypersonic defense. And so when I talk about [$1.4 billion, $15 billion] (ph) going to with solid growth, it's embedded in our growth projection, it's really these weapons systems that Jim just mentioned.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Rich Safran from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Rich Safran: Thank you, Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Rich Safran: So I wanted to know if you could just expand on your opening remarks about international demand. Wanted to know if you could maybe discuss some of the timing of international award opportunities where you're seeing the most demand for what types of equipment? And finally here, are you seeing any more interest in direct commercial versus FMS in international orders that you're signing-up now? Thanks.
Jay Malave: Rich, good question on international. For us over the next five years or so, we expect international to be a significant contributor to our growth. It's embedded amongst each of our four pillars. But when you strip out international alone, you're talking high-single-digit growth there. As far as contracting most of that, particularly as you're dealing munitions is FMS, concluding it as well as F-35 program. So most of that right now that we've got embedded in our forecast, particularly on the growth side is FMS related. As Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're very excited about the Australian Military Satellite Communication program, it's a multi-billion dollar opportunity and that really expands the international footprint of our space business, which has historically been predominantly a domestic U.S.-based business. So these opportunities continue to present themselves, there was a lot more opportunity in front of us and that is absolutely a growth driver for us over the next five years.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. And I could add some more background to Jay's remarks there. As mentioned, space, there's like an incredible amount of upside, the notion of independent for sovereign satellite communication for military and national defense is catching on if you will. U.K. already has a system like this, but they want to replace and upgrade that. Australia is getting into that, a game as well and I think there'll be countries in the Middle-East and elsewhere that we'll look into these options for space. On the Aero side, the F-35 is been incredibly popular and I think on every competition. Meaningful competition over the last few years as far as fifth-generation fighter aircraft go. In addition to that F-16, we can build them fast enough with additional orders coming in. We're going to compete in India to try to get that order as well and it's a matter of us being able to get to the production rate that the international is demanding and requesting of us there. RMS is having a lot of success with the SEAHAWK helicopter for example and various versions of the Black Hawk. As we mentioned, Australia as part of that. Also the radar systems are becoming more exportable as we go forward and both in Europe and Asia there is demand for those. And then at MFC, obviously PAC-3 Javelin, GMLRS, ultimately potentially JASSM and LRASM for somewhere closer allies are going to be in the mix. So, there's a wide and broad range across all of our business areas, a significant international demand that we'll be seeing over the next few years. Contracting that through the FMS process does take some time. On the other hand, there are a few DCS programs and projects, but a lot of this is going to be -- continue to be export controlled by the U.S. government and there'll be largely FMS. But it's a broad range, it’s going to last for many years, and we'll continue to be updating you on other programs, let's start getting more international traction.
Operator: The next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning. Maybe on RMS, could you talk about the driver to the expansion in the margin implied in the guidance? I guess a couple of 100 basis points implied run-rate for the rest of the year. Is that something programmatic, was there extra R&D associated with FLRAA? And also on FLRAA now that, that decision is made. Anything you anticipate needing to do at Sikorsky to maintain competitiveness? Thanks.
Jay Malave: So, Myles, on your first question on RMS margins, you know, again the first quarter was 10%. We've got a guide of nearly 12% for the year. What happens is a little bit of the opposite of MFC. This was their lowest property adjustment quarter of the year. We expect that to grow based on the program schedules and the risk retirements that we foresee for the balance of the year and so that will step-up and just give you -- just to frame a reference. The first quarter their step-ups were about 20% of their profit. For the full-year, we're expecting that to be closer to 30% for profit adjustments for the full-year for RMS. So that will be a big contributor to the increase in profitability. The second element is that we have just some sales mix, we have some pass that attracts higher margin sales up in the second-half of the year, which will also give a boost to their margins. So that's fundamentally what's happening at RMS. As far as FLRAA, we had -- in any impacts related to Sikorsky, part of win announced a cost-reduction program in the fourth quarter had taken a few charges about $100 million of charges at RMS in the fourth quarter, about maybe half of that was related to Sikorsky and cost reduction and cost competitiveness. And so, we have just an interesting dynamic there that while we've got production, particularly in the Black Hawk stepping down here in 2023, it actually steps up slightly again in 2023 -- I'm sorry in 2024, and then we have significant growth on the CH-53 program in ‘24 where we're expecting to double our deliveries on that program. And so, we're just dealing with a one year-type of a trough I would say. I think the team, Stephanie Hill and her team have done a nice job of rightsizing the cost structure for where we are today, while at the same time maintaining the capability to provide us growth in the future.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Matt Akers from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt Akers: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about missiles and fire control, you made some comments in the opening remarks about some of the multi-year procurement programs going on now. When should we think about, sort of, transitioning from, kind of, flattish sales this year? I think you've talked about mid-single-digit. Growth and then also was there any investment needed to support that in terms of capacity scaling up your business there?
Jay Malave: Yes. So, when you look to get over the next five years at MFC, they're certainly our strongest grower, we'll lay out a little bit more specifics as we go through our strategic planning process in the summer and we give you, kind of, a first look on 2024 and maybe beyond when we do that in the October call. But I certainly are strongest grower. Yes, there are capacity investments. Jim mentioned some of the funding that is being proposed in the Presidential budget request for facilitation investments. We've also invested our own money’s and capability PAC-3 is a good example. I mean, a few other programs where we've got in front of funding to make sure that we can deliver to the requirements for capacity and delivery requirements that our customers asking for. And so, again, I think we've got a good beat there. We've talked about different capacity levels over the next few years. We reached some of these levels in ‘25, ‘26 and ‘27. And that investment really between now and over the next few years is going to help enable that capacity increase in growth as well.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. And it's Jim, Matt. I could give you some details on exactly what we're talking about here. So for PAC-3 capacity 2022 is 450 and we're planning to make the investments and working with government to coordinate with us on this to 550 by 2026. So just three years from now, we'll go from 450 to 550. And then similar with the Javelin, which has been pretty widely discussed in the past. Our 2022 capacity was about 2,000 a year and by 2026, we'll have 3,500 plus, and ultimately, we're going to get to 4,000. When it comes to GMLRS, which is the HIMARS munition, the original capacity last year was 10,000. We're taking that to 14,000 by 2026. So these are meaningful step-ups, I guess you could call them in capacity and we're doing those, because we think we have a really strong demand for that capacity to fill it. And we're now programing, which customers go where and what point in time and working with the U.S. government to do that with -- along with their own priorities. So, we've got a significant plan to grow the business at MFC. There's investment either through our own rates and our CapEx plan plus funds committed by the government, because we are making a pretty strong case, I think with them to drive an anti-fragility program into munitions and other sort of high-importance production facilities and production systems. We got asked to double or triple production of certain munitions and the answer came back, as you see, it's going to take three years to do a lot of that. We want to get the fragility out of the system. So if this ever happens again, it's six months instead of three years to get a meaningful improvement in capacity and that's how you see the government acting now with the long-lead time parts in the [Indiscernible] and the multi-years that they are now implementing.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky: Book keeping question for you and then Jim, a more strategic one. Book keeping question, Jay, what kind of book-to-bill do you need to have this year to support the commentary about return to growth in ‘24 and is the timing of those awards important? And then for Jim, I'm going to just have you double-click a little bit on the Evolve initiative and the announcement that you made here recently with the Crescent Organization and supporting later communications. Just kind of curious from a big picture perspective, what kind of capital you're anticipating, putting into an organization like Crescent and the capital that you're going to be putting into this Evolve initiative over time?
Jay Malave: So let me just start with a book-to-bill question. Jason, essentially, it's one. Last year, we ended the book -- the backlog at $150 billion. This year, we're planning for that to be around the case maybe it's down $1 billion or up $1 billion. But effectively, a one book-to-bill sets us up for the growth to resume in 2024. So, we don't need to necessarily see the backlog. There is opportunity for it to grow from where we are, and where we landed or ended in 2022. But right now, we're planning for that to be generally flattish and that's where we need to be to drive the growth resumption in 2024.
Jim Taiclet: And Jason, let me put the whole notion of Evolve and Crescent into the overall strategy that accompany for you and give provide context that way. We've got three main strategic initiatives that the company that we're driving. One I just mentioned, is just to take the fragility of the production system, not just for Lockheed Martin, but for U.S. government and our industry and we just describe some of the ways that we're endeavoring to do that with government and so, that's the first strategy. The second one is, you've heard us talk about before 21st Century Security and that is working beyond the five defense primes in our supply chains to bring the latest and most advanced Newtonian and Digital Technologies International Defense and that means we have to work at Lockheed Martin with a wider variety of companies from the tech sector to laser-guided weapons, supply chain companies that we may not be doing current business with and they can be startups to Microsoft sized corporations. So, we are structuring our company to be able to participate and cooperate and collaborate with that much broader range of partners to deliver this 21st Century Security concept. And so, Evolve is meant to complement what we already had. We have a ventures group, Lockheed Martin Ventures that deals with start-ups that have a type technology that are promising for our core business. On the other side, we have partnerships and agreements and arrangements with our big five defense prime, so to speak. So, Northrop Grumman, us and BA for example work together on the F-35 aircraft and there are many, many of those. But what we needed in the middle was something to work with mid-sized companies and companies in the technology sector to work with us in ways that really don't have a traditional history with companies like Lockheed Martin, our peer group. And so, Evolve is now meant to be able to do joint ventures, co-investments, commercial arrangements with mid-sized to large companies outside of our normal sphere so to speak, and deliver on new capabilities for space exploration and also for national defense. And so, present is the business that we’ll work with others outside of Lockheed Martin to figure out how to finance and then how to implement and how to sustain lunar service right for everything from transportation on the surface to basically the Uber for the moon, if you will at the end of the day, to the communications and positioning and navigation systems that you need to have on orbit around the moon, so that you can actually operate on the lunar surface with either robotics or with humans. So [Indiscernible] has designed to do that. The capital that we will deploy to build that type of business will be more creatively sourced, right? It will not just -- it will not come out of the disclosure statement that goes back to the DoD or NASA into our rates, right? It's going to be independently source, we may contribute, our partners may contribute directly, but they will be outside the rate structure and the federal acquisition regulations. So that we can get the full benefit of those investments overtime, and also creative -- more creatively finance them and partner with others to do that. So that's the concept that's why we're doing it and we intend to grow it without necessarily burdening the CapEx disclosure statement and ramifications of that to the company.
Jay Malave: And by breaking it out of the business area, business says structure enables these ideas in these pursuits to really operate at a speed and agility level. It probably wouldn't otherwise be available to them working within the bureaucratic structure that we have in our business areas with the multi -- all the policies and procedures that we have. And so, we give them a little bit more flexibility to operate with some speed. And as Jim mentioned, the ability to pursue co-investment by others as well.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Scott Deuschle: Hey, good morning. Jay, if I were to model Q2 through Q4 space systems sales based-off of Q1. And then just to adjust for increased number of weeks in those future reporting periods? And go get around $12.8 billion space segment sales for the year versus the guidance midpoint of $11.6 billion? So basically 10% higher than what you've guided. So, curious if you comment on what prevents that type of upside case from happening or to ask another way, what the volume headwinds are and the remainder of the year relative to the first quarter? Thank you.
Jay Malave: You know, it's a good question, Scott. And as I mentioned in my remarks, it's excellent growth from Next Gen Interceptor Classified programs and National Security Space, areas that you would expect. But they also had some growth and I mentioned that there was boosted, protect -- some protected comms programs Orion, fleet ballistic missiles. Those are programs we're expecting to be a little bit more steady state. And so they just were -- they just benefited from some program timing here in the quarter. And just to give you an example, protected comms is up 50% in the quarter. We're expecting that to generally be flat for the year. Orion was up 20% in the quarter. We're expecting that to generally be flat for the year. FBM was up about 20% in the quarter and that was pretty much the full-years’ worth of growth all in the first quarter. And so just these things all came together here in the first quarter, that really caused this growth of 16%. We expect this program that I just mentioned to really normalize in the balance of the year. We will continue to see some growth on some of these other programs. I will acknowledge there probably is some upside to their sales, but it's not $1 billion that you're nearly talking anywhere between $100 million to $200 million of probably upside to where we are today.
Operator: Next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Jay, I wanted to pursue some of these other income numbers, because they were actually a big part of the large beat this quarter relative to my expectation anyway. So if you look at the other net that's in operating income, it was $2 million. You kept the guide at minus $3.25 million for the year. So what happens in the subsequent quarters? It's all negative 100 plus or is there some quarter that it's abnormally high? And then somewhat less, but other non-operating income was $49 million. You disclosed $29 million of that was the venture stuff, what was the other $20 million. And I left out the $29 million in the other net number, which was for deferred compensation adjustment.
Jay Malave: Okay. Let me -- so George, a fair question. Just to -- you may tackle a big question, the big picture question in terms of what happens for the balance of the year. Just on the investment gains, obviously we saw that in the quarter. We talked about that being $0.18 imply, because we're not changing it implies that we're reversing the balance of the year, so we'll see. We'll give that an update in the second quarter, update more halfway through the year and make a call on that. The other element we just were speaking about a little bit in terms of our investment in LM Evolve, we have some of those investments increasing in the balance of the year as well. And then there's just residual corporate costs that we have flowing through. And so all those things are allocated. We'll monitor those throughout the rest of the year and see whether or not. Again, I think we'll just make an assessment halfway through the year on where we are those things to the extent there's upside, we'll make an update at that point in time.
Operator: The next question is from Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ken Herbert: Hi, good morning. Jay or Jim, I wanted to see if you can provide a little more granularity on the TR3 and the F-35 program. Specifically, it seems like that program is faced in ongoing delays and other headwinds in terms of adoption and implementation. But how is that impacting deliveries this year and how do you see that timing of that getting back on track?
Jim Taiclet: Yes, Ken, it’s Jim. In the round, we're in the very late innings of it fully implementing this Tech Refresh 3. The point of it is really critical and that is it gives us much, much greater capability to really make the F-35 a true edge compute node in an open architecture, Internet of Things construct a system. And so the three elements of a edge compute node in a 5G system are data storage onboard, the vehicle, data processing on board the vehicle, multipath ability to get back to the cloud, right, finding the cloud as to whatever you're enterprise is. And the TR3 upgrade provides all of that. It's coming together of a number of components I'll call them and subcomponents, which is pretty intricate, fairly leading edge for the aerospace industry to accomplish and it's being done. So there has been some delays in some of the hardware and software. But we're really in the very late innings of getting this all together. We're literally in flight test right now and will we wrap all that up by October or December or et cetera. We've got to see what the test results are. And work with the government to define exactly when everybody is ready to go and implement in our production system, in the factory, those software loads, and that's where we're at now. So I would consider this extremely high degree of difficulty dive and we're going to make sure that it's done right. And we can prove set rate in our Block 15, so that's what we're up to and we're working closely with the joint program office to define that and make that successful. And we are seeing the demand for the aircraft both from the U.S. and international customers really, kind of, blossom here lately. So I think we're in good shape on the program.
Maria Ricciardone Lee: All right. Lois, this is Maria. I think we've come to the top of the hour. So I'm just going to quickly turn it back to Jim for any final thoughts.
Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. As we conclude, I'd like to say thank you to our 116,000 employees here at Lockheed Martin for their commitment to providing our is the 21st Century Digital and Physical Technologies that will help them deter conflict and win if they have to. So thank you all again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. And Lois, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

Hope you've all had a good start to the new year, and I thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call as we review our results, key business area accomplishments and our outlook for 2023. I'd like to begin with a few highlights from the quarter and from the year, and then Jay will review the financials in a more detailed manner. Lockheed Martin had a strong close to 2022. All of our business areas met or exceeded our prior expectations, resulting in a 2022 full year sales of $66 billion, segment operating profit of $7.2 billion and earnings per share of $21.66. Our free cash flow for the year of $6.1 billion also came in above our prior expectation, while backlog for the year increased to $150 billion, driven by all-time record orders for Lockheed Martin. Our financial results included more than $1.7 billion of independent research and development investments, or IRAD, a new high watermark for the company. We also continue to modernize and streamline our operations to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. Significant capital projects include our ongoing investment in what we call One Lockheed Martin transformation or 1LMX. This is our multiyear internal project to transform our business processes and systems from end-to-end. By implementing new digital tools in our operations and expanding our use of model-based engineering to enhance our speed to market and our cost competitiveness. In 2022, we completed a majority of the detail design for our new systems and business processes. And for 2023, we expect to complete the detailed design and implementation road maps that go with it, and then we'll transition to the system build and configuration phase over the next couple of years. These IRAD and capital investments accelerate the capabilities our customers need and for our operations to efficiently and effectively meet those needs. From a capital return perspective, we delivered approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022 via share repurchases of $7.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion. During the fourth quarter specifically, we entered into a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we've retired approximately 7 million shares under that agreement so far.  We expect to complete our remaining repurchase authorization of $10 billion over the next few years, consistent with our focus to deliver free cash flow per share growth to you, the investor. These operational and financial results created significant value for our shareholders, ending the year with a total shareholder return of 40%. I will touch briefly now on the Department of Defense, or DoD, budget. In late December, Congress signed the FY '23 Omnibus spending bill into law, appropriating $858 billion for National Defense, including $817 billion for the DoD-based budget. This reflects approximately 10% growth year-over-year for both national defense and the DoD-based budget. The law also represents a 6%, or $45 billion increase from the President's budget request for DoD. These appropriations enabled us, along with the Joint Program Office, to finalize the contract for the production and delivery of up to 398 F-35s for $30 billion in Lots 15 and 16, including the option for Lot 17. Further, several other of Lockheed Martin’s programs received the funding levels necessary to drive the growth outlook we previously identified, including our combat rescue helicopter, the C-130J, Blackhawk, CH-53K and FAAD. We view this funding outcome as positive for the future, and our current expectation is that growth will materialize over the longer term, starting in 2024. Let's now turn to the four growth pillars: programs of record, hypersonics, classified activities and new awards. With regard to programs of record, there were several important developments in key signature programs in our fourth quarter. On the F-35, the definitization of Lots 15 through 17, as I mentioned a minute ago, included the first F-35 aircraft to be produced for Belgium, Finland and Poland. We received authorization to procure long lead items for Lot 18 F-35 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and U.S. allies as well. We also formally welcomed Germany, the ninth foreign military sales country, to the F-35 Lightning II program. And earlier in January, Canada officially became an F-35 operator as the country selected the aircraft to replace its aging fighter fleet. We continue to expect deliveries of the F-35 to ramp to 156 by 2025. Despite the temporary pause in flight operations and corresponding suspension of engine deliveries that began in December and resulted in the delivery of just 141 F-35s in 2022, seven shy of our expectation of 148 before the engine issue was discovered. Also in the quarter, the U.S. Navy authorized the CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter to enter full rate production and then its deployment phase. This important milestone allows the program to proceed beyond low-rate initial production. And this achievement attests to our long-standing partnership with the U.S. Marine Corps and instills confidence and stability in Sikorsky's diverse domestic supply chain. In addition, at Sikorsky, international demand for the Black Hawk remains strong. Last week, the Australian Army announced it will acquire 40 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters to replace its current multi-role helicopter fleet. Deliveries are expected to begin for Australia this year. Further, the Lockheed Martin built Orion exploration class spacecraft launched on NASA's ARTEMIS 1 and completed a 25-day flight test, slashing down off the coast of California. This successful mission takes us one step closer to the first woman and first person of color setting foot on the moon. On its journey, Orion traveled more than 1.4 million miles through deep space and surpassed records for total distance. It traveled 270,000 miles from home and the farthest distance from earth by a spacecraft designed to carry humans. We look forward to the next stages of the program with seven additional missions under contract. Turning to hypersonics. In December, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control and the U.S. Air Force successfully conducted a hypersonic-boosted flight test of the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon. This was the first launch of a full prototype operational missile, meeting all its objectives for the test, including reaching speeds of greater than 5 times the speed of sound. With regard to classified programs, we achieved successful milestones across multiple business areas in 2022 and grew 5% year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in classified that will outpace the rest of the portfolio over the next several years. And finally, at new awards, Lockheed Martin's Next-Generation Interceptor, or NGI, continues to make progress. In late October, we announced the delivery of the first NGI flight software package to the Missile Defense Agency, providing the framework of software development tools, process workflows, scripts and environments. The delivery was ahead of schedule and is a critical step on the path for flight testing and fielding. This program remains a focused competition for Lockheed Martin with the first NGI forecast for delivery in 2027. With regard to the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft, or FLRAA, competition, we were disappointed in the U.S. Army's decision. And upon review, we determined a formal protest by Sikorsky on behalf of Team Defiant to be the best course of action. We continue to believe that Defiant X with its increased speed, range, manoeuvrability and survivability is the transformational and most cost-effective aircraft that best meets the selection criteria for this competition. Sikorsky remains one of two competitors for the other component of the Future Vertical Lift initiative that's called the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, or FARA, which is currently expected to be awarded in 2025. The first RatorX-competitive prototype is over 90% complete and has more than 65% of its acceptance testers already done. Sikorsky is the only company with a representative FARA technology demonstrator aircraft. I saw it fly down at West Palm Beach a few months ago. It's amazing, the S97 RAIDER, which has completed more than 110 flight hours. In November, Norway became the first international customer for our new TPY-4 radar. It's the first software-defined radar that outperforms in target detection, mission diversity and transportability. Norway is going to receive eight of Lockheed Martin's TPY-4 radar with options for three additional radar. Finally, backlog ended 2022 at $150 billion with book-to-bill of 1.2 times and increases in every business area across Lockheed Martin. This strong demand signal bodes well for future growth over the longer term for our company. So, these four pillars will guide us as we face a challenging geopolitical environment and apply growth and integrated capabilities mindset to everything we do here. As conflict continues in Ukraine, unfortunately, and projected global threats require coordinated efforts to protect the U.S. and our allied territories, ongoing progress in our 21st Century Security vision will enable the acceleration of advanced capabilities to defer these threats and drive effective Joint All Domain Operations for our military service customers. In the fourth quarter, we continued to announce and expand strategic agreements with America's leading commercial digital companies, such as IBM's Red Hat, to advance artificial intelligence innovation on Lockheed Martin military platforms; and for Microsoft, with whom we're going to help power classified cloud advanced technologies for the Department of Defense. Microsoft's latest secure framework will make Lockheed Martin the first non-government entity to independently operate inside the Microsoft Azure Government Secret Cloud, ushering in a new era of cloud opportunities for the industry. As we look ahead, demand for Lockheed Martin platforms and systems is strong in the United States and abroad. We continue to expect 2023 sales about the same level as we discussed back in October. We also continue to expect a return to sustained top line growth in 2024 and beyond as headwinds diminish in our program mix, the supply chain continues to recover and our signature programs grow. Free cash flow per share will remain a key focus as we maximize returns for you, our shareholders. 2022 is a year of great accomplishments for our company in the face of a lot of dynamic challenges. The outstanding achievements of our teams resulted from real deep commitments across our business areas and better cooperation among them as well as our corporate functions to develop, produce and deliver world-class systems to our country and its allies. Our progress this year is a testament to the dedication of our 116,000 team members and the values we all share. So with that, let me hand it off to Jay to give more color on the financials, and we'll join you later to answer your questions. Jay?
Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results for 2022, additional business area detail and offer a first full look at 2023 guidance. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart three, an overview of our consolidated 2022 financials. Lockheed Martin followed up a solid third quarter with a strong finish to 2022, highlighted by 7% year-over-year sales growth in the fourth quarter and effectively managed a turbulent year impacted by COVID and supply chain disruptions as well as inflation levels not seen in decades. Besides sales, we also exceeded our expectations for segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow, all while absorbing incremental headwinds tied to restructuring activities within RMS and mark-to-market losses in our investment portfolios. We also booked record orders in 2022, resulting in 11% growth to an ending backlog of $150 billion. In addition to our orders on F-35, we experienced a surge in new interest for our industry-leading security solutions, such as in classified programs in Space and in Missiles and Fire Control, where we booked approximately $1.5 billion in orders, reflecting increased demand to replenish U.S. stocks and enhance security positions globally. And we delivered on our commitment to boost shareholder returns by deploying nearly $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while making significant investments in our businesses. Taken together, these results demonstrate the perseverance of our dedicated employees to perform in challenging environments and support our expectations for 2023 and beyond. Taking a closer look at full year results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit on Chart four. Sales came in higher than expected by nearly $750 million, limiting the decline to 2% year-over-year and essentially recovering to the sales guidance we had originally communicated last January. The stronger-than-expected performance was broad-based across all four business areas and reflects strong coordination with supplier partners to drive material throughput and program schedule performance as well as some favourable award timing, which drove additional revenue. Segment operating profit declined 2% year-over-year but also finished higher than expected by almost $50 million driven by the higher sales. Operating margins settled at 10.9%, slightly lower year-over-year and versus expectations based on lower net favourable profit adjustments. Moving to earnings per share on Chart five. Adjusted earnings per share grew 2% for the year as the benefit from share repurchases overcame headwinds from lower segment profit and FAS/CAS pension income. Moving to cash flow on Chart six. We delivered $6.1 billion of free cash flow for the year while investing almost $1.7 billion in CapEx at a ratio of 1.4 times depreciation. We also ended the year with nearly $1.5 billion of accelerated payments to our suppliers, maintaining our commitment to a resilient supply chain. As I noted earlier, 2022 represented a significant year of cash deployment. In total, we returned 178% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2022, leveraging our performance and strong balance sheet while still investing for our anticipated growth trajectory in 2024 and beyond. Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart seven. Full year sales grew 1% year-over-year primarily driven by increases in our classified programs, partially offset by lower F-35 production volume. Operating profit increased 2% driven by higher net favourable profit adjustments more than offsetting the impact of the lower volume. For the year, backlog at Aeronautics grew 15%. As mentioned, Aeronautics completed the F-35 Lot 15 through 17 negotiations and secured production volumes while providing the services with a value proposition that combines the highest performance at affordable cost. Looking at Missiles and Fire Control on Page eight. Sales decreased 3% driven primarily by lower volume on our special ops sustainment program following the Afghan withdrawal, along with lower volume on sensors programs. Segment operating profit was down 1% with lower favourable profit adjustments primarily on PAC-3. For the year, backlog increased 6% on the back of tactical missile strength. At Rotary and Mission Systems on Page nine, sales decreased year-over-year by 4% driven primarily by a non-recurring revenue event in our training business in 2021 along with lower C6ISR and Black Hawk volume at Sikorsky. Operating profit decreased 7%, following Sikorsky and C6ISR volume and lower favourable profit adjustments on the Black Hawk program. Backlog grew 4% in 2022, led by the Defense of Guam award, where RMS will be the lead integrator of the multi-domain air and missile defense system as well as stronger Sikorsky orders. Turning to Chart 10 in our Space business area. Sales decreased 2% due to the 2021 renationalization of the AWE program, partially offset by growth on a Next-Generation Interceptor program and national security space. Operating profit decreased 8% with lower net profit adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Backlog grew 16% based on strong classified program captures and Orion orders. So all told, a strong finish to the year. So let's now shift to 2023 on Page 11. Before introducing our expectations, I'd like to inform you of a reporting change in segment operating profit starting in 2023. We will report purchased intangible asset amortization expense in unallocated corporate expense below segment operating profit. Previously, intangible amortization was included in segment operating profit. This change will not impact total earnings, and we believe the change provides a more accurate view of operating performance for each of our four business areas. The impact is approximately 40 basis points on our 2023 expectations, consistent with the impact in previous years.  Our 2023 financial outlook includes the impact of this change, and you can find supporting data for these adjustments in the appendices of our web charts as well as in the earnings release.  Okay, let's get into the outlook for 2023. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $65 billion to $66 billion and the midpoint is slightly below 2022. Speaking to the timing of sales this year, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest quarter of the year, ramping up quarter-over-quarter as we did in 2022. Segment operating profit for 2023 normalized for intangible asset amortization has improved what we thought -- from what we thought in October. And we now estimate only 10 basis points of headwind from 2022 with segment operating margins at 11.1% under our new reporting. We currently expect $2.1 billion of FAS/CAS income in 2023. It's estimated to be roughly $100 million lower in '22, excluding the impact from our pension transfer transaction. Our earnings per share is expected to be between $26.60 and $26.90 for '23 with the year-over-year reduction to adjusted EPS primarily driven by lower segment operating profit in FAS/CAS income, partially offset by the benefit from a lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2023 is greater to or equal than $6.2 billion and assumes continued enactment of the R&D tax capitalization.  This increase of $100 million to cash generation, along with our share repurchase guide of another $4 billion, highlights our continued focus on increasing free cash flow per share for our shareholders. This projected combination of higher free cash flow and a lower share count lead to a mid-single-digit growth expectation in free cash flow per share in 2023. Okay. On Chart 20 -- on Chart 12, let's sum it all up. We closed out 2022 with a strong finish with operating momentum and a robust backlog, which have us well positioned to resume growth in 2024 and beyond. We also placed a premium on leveraging our strong cash generation and balance sheet to increase cash returns to our shareholders with a significant increase to share repurchases. Across all four business areas, our breadth of development, production and sustainment programs continue to drive a foundation of growth and sustained high performance. And we will work actively with our customers to meet their increasing demands and mission requirements looking ahead to the future. Our investments for growth, value and efficiency are aligned with our strategy for technology advancement and improved synergies across Lockheed Martin. So in closing, we believe the business is well positioned for long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.  With that, John, let's open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first go the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. 
David Strauss: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, I wanted to ask you about, you highlighted the headwinds that you have in terms of your program mix in '23 is the reason for flattish sales. Could you quantify what that number is in terms of the headwind and what programs specifically you're looking at? And then as a quick follow-up, the FY '23 budget came in, I think, a fair amount better than you were anticipating plus ops on F-35 and C-130. How might that change what you've previously said with regard to the reacceleration in growth in 2024? Is it better than low single digit now? Thanks. 
Jay Malave: So David, let me take the first one and then kick over the second part of your question to Jim and just really talk in the context of '23 and what's going to be different in 2024. In 2023, when you look at it, we've got continued growth in our four pillars, really the programs of record that Jim had mentioned. But we do have some specific unique items to 2023, and I'll give you an example. For example, in aero. On the F-35, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in sustainment on the program. But we are expecting also a mid-single-digit decline in production as deliveries catch up to the material that we had purchased in prior years. Similarly, on the F-16, we're going to see continued growth in production to roll out our backlog, but we are seeing a reduction in modernization and sustainment programs on the F-16. So as those -- both of those normalize in 2023 going into 2024, they will no longer be headwinds, which will continue to allow for growth in Aeronautics, particularly in the F-35 sustainment and on F-16 production. Similarly, like MFC, what we saw in 2022 and it carries over a little bit to 2023 is some of the areas where we see the higher demand from a production level, particularly in programs of record, things like PAC-3, it's taken us a little bit longer than we originally expected to ramp up. And so we're going to see gradual improvement in supply chain as well as our internal operations in '23 with stronger growth in 2024. At RMS, CH-53 will double deliveries in '24 versus '23. And '23 versus '22 is pretty much flat deliveries. We also see probably some Black Hawk growth in '24 as well. And what we're going through right now is the transition for multiyear 9 to multiyear 10 in RMS and Sikorsky specifically. So those are all things that we think will lift from '24 relative to '23, and those are headwinds that are really unique to 2023.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. And as far as where the defense budget came out, David, it really aligns with our view in our company about the nature of the geopolitical threat, the need to modernize U.S. and allied forces to continue to hopefully deter armed conflict beyond the sad and unfortunate situation in the Ukraine that's already happened and the fact that there's bipartisan support in Congress to do just that. So we've been expecting all along in our kind of long-range plan that the U.S. government and Congress would step up to meet the reality of the global geopolitical situation. And that's exactly what played out in the budget process for FY '23. We also expect that same reality to continue to sadly exist again in the next budget cycle, which is happening even now in -- for 2024. So we don't see the circumstances the fundamentals changing. Therefore, we also believe that the continued robustness of the defense budget is going to be a reality as well.
Jay Malave: Just let me follow up on your last question, David, whether or not there's upside. Where we see potential increases to where we were at baseline before really is in MFC. Over the next five years, we've got revenue potential. It's around $6 billion. And that would more than offset lost revenue associated with FLRAA should that decision hold. And so net-net, we see that there could be some upside over the next five years.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. 
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning. Jim, maybe one quick one and one sort of allow you to expand a little bit. When is your expected restart of deliveries in the F-35, as a quick one? And then, obviously, there's more of a debate going on in D.C. around fiscal restraint and has been in place in the last several years. And so I'm just curious where you think this ends up as one thing, but more importantly, what, if anything, do you do operationally to prepare yourself for whatever the outcomes are in terms of balance sheet holding back on repo or leaning forward, looking for areas where 2023 budget -- excuse me, 2024 budget might be in a continuing resolution for a full year. Anything on that perspective from an operational perspective?
Jim Taiclet: Sure, Myles. So as far as timing and resumption of deliveries on F-35, I think it's really important to differentiate between delivery and production, right? So we are continuing production in the final assembly factories at Fort Worth and Italy and in Japan at the same pace we expected to before the mishap occurred. We're also continuing to order and receive parts and materials from our supply chain as well. And so once an aircraft rolls out of the factory, our pilots and the DoD pilots conduct a handful of acceptance flights. That's what's kind of on hold right now is just that portion of the process. So the vast majority of our revenue, much greater than 90% is earned when the aircraft rolls out from the plant door. So Jay can add more color on the financial perspective, if you like, a little bit later, but that's really what happens. And so as far as the timing of resumption of deliveries, we'll be notified of that when the U.S. government and the propulsion supplier conclude their ongoing mishap investigation. Jay, do you want to add anything to that?
Jay Malave: No. You got it. That's it.
Jim Taiclet: Okay. And then secondly, we really can't predict the political dynamic in Congress and -- within and with the administration. So we're going to keep our head down, stay on our plan, do our job and expect that the right thing will occur at the other end of the 2024 budget process, which is fully funding and making available that funding to the department of defense, so we can deter conflict with them and that they can acquire what they need to do that. So that's our expectation. It's really difficult for us to lay out what we think the budget process will be given the nature of the House, Senate and the administration right now. But we expect that they are going to come together and do what's needed to defend the country and get the budget done.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Noah Poponak: Hi, good morning. Jay, we've talked about this dynamic where the outlays are trailing the authorization and the possibility that supply chain is intertwined in that. And that was kind of tough in the first half of the year, look to be getting better in the third quarter, but then exited the year declining. Do you have any insight into incremental insight into what's going on there when that gets better? And to the extent that supply chain is related, your comments that you expect that to improve through '23, is that underway? You already see that happening? Or is that still just a logical anticipation of timing?
Jay Malave: Sure. Good question. Let me follow up. And we looked at this and tried to triangulate performance in a number of different ways. We looked at just straight piece part on-time delivery here in the fourth quarter relative to what we saw in the second and the third. We also looked at program performance, so earn value-type metrics, and we really didn't see a meaningful change in on-time delivery or schedule performance relative to our earned value systems. But what I will say is the fourth quarter had a significant step-up in requirements. And if you adjust for the number of weeks in the fourth quarter relative to the balance of the year and you also adjust for some of these benefits that we saw in terms of award timing, our requirements in the fourth quarter stepped up sequentially by about 5%. And I would say the entire value chain, whether it's our internal operations and the supply chain, was able to meet that increased level of requirements. So that, to me, bodes well to the future as well as expecting a gradual improvement in 2023. And I think that just provides a reasonable assumption and a reasonable basis for that assumption
Operator: And we'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. 
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning. If you look at the F-35 program, like the incremental profit you reported was about a 16.4% rate, so I assume you stepped up the margin on the F-35. And going forward then, the slight decline that you're forecasting in the margin probably reflects sustainment growing versus production. And a quick follow-up, the $20 million charge that you took in a classified program in aero, was that the same program that you took large charges a couple of years ago? Thanks.
Jay Malave: Okay. So George, I can probably answer your questions with one yes, but maybe I'll provide a little bit of color there. I now take the -- you're correct, on the charge we took, that was related to the program. We continue to have some learnings there. But our team, I think, in Skunk Works is doing a great job managing that program. And this is a development program where you see and you continue to have learnings. But in the grand scheme of things, I think we've managed that quite well. And it really hasn't -- did not impact our results. And as far as the F-35 program, we did see some benefits there. And you're right, in the quarter, we were -- the results there were augmented not only by the volume but as well as the net profit adjustments at Aeronautics, and it was across the board. I think next year, as we think about the margin, yes, there's a little bit of a headwind there. I think mix does play a part in it as well as right now, we're planning a little bit lower favourable profit adjustments. But for the year, in the grand scheme of Lockheed Martin, this year, we did about 25% of profit in net profit adjustments, and we would expect that to be somewhat similar for the entire company for '23. Thanks for the question, George.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead. 
Robert Spingarn: Good morning. Jim, I think everyone would agree that Lockheed's got the pole position in offensive hypersonics. Strong program portfolio there and some recent successes. What I think people might be interested in are your efforts as well in counter hypersonics as we might expect that to be a growing portion of the budget. Can you talk about that a little bit?
Jim Taiclet: Sure. And it's largely classified, Rob. But what I can say is many of the elements of counter hypersonics, we also have a pole position in, right? So we've got existing products that we can take the lessons learned from and a lot of the engineering and apply them to just a faster incoming target, right? So we're working on NGI, as you already heard, which is a ballistic missile. It travels at similar speeds. We have the FAAD system, which is a sort of a high-altitude interceptor as well. And then we have PAC-3, which is a very accurate lower-level further in, if you will, defensive systems. So we've got the engineering talent. We've got the intellectual property. And we're developing these 21st Century Security concepts like applying artificial intelligence to network systems together and process data much more quickly, which, of course, you need that to process the information coming in on a Mach 5 missile, right? So I think we have a lot of the elements that will go into the eventual counter hypersonic solutions, and we are working on many of them right now in integrating what we have and developing what we need.
Operator: Our next question is from Richard Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. 
Richard Safran: Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning. How are you? 
Jim Taiclet: Good morning. Well. Thanks. 
Richard Safran: So I wanted to ask you about the F-16 and maybe expand on the remarks you made just a few moments ago. I thought you might comment on things like U.S. and international opportunity set ahead, maybe update on the first delivery expected production rates. And if it's at all possible, maybe touch on like what margins you're expecting on the program right now. I'm just thinking that they should be pretty decent given the move to Greenville was done to improve the cost structure on the program.
Jim Taiclet: Rich, it's Jim. I'll start off quickly and hand it over to Jay for some of the background and data associated with the program. But the really great news is Block 70, which is the production article out of Greenville. The first Greenville Block 70 test flight was this morning was successful, really great milestone for the company and for that organization in South Carolina. But there's significant demand for this aircraft. A lot of coming organically, I guess, I'll call it, from allies around the world. Also, we're out actively marketing this jet to those countries that may not be authorized yet or maybe not have the infrastructure for F-35 at this moment but may in the future. India is one of those. I co-chair the U.S.-India CEO Forum with Secretary Raimondo. We're going to be going over there in a month or so with a team of CEOs from across our industry and meet with theirs and try to get collaboration going. And one of the, I would say, primary opportunities in that endeavour is the F-21, which is F-16 variant specifically designed for India, for example. So we haven't made that sale yet, but I can tell you all the way up to my level, we are out marketing F-16, and we have a lot of organic demand coming in from either existing, order customers or new ones. Jay, anything you want to add?
Jay Malave: Sure. Just maybe a little bit more color. Just on top of the first flight that we had today the successful first flight, congratulations to our Aeronautics team there. We have over 20 aircraft that are currently in process in the production phase. We will deliver anywhere between, say, 78 aircraft this year, and then that will step up significantly in 2024. And so we're on a good path that we recognize the opportunities that are in front of us. There are a few countries that have been announced there that we're eagerly awaiting contract finalization, hopefully this year, with Jordan and Bulgaria. That's about combined about 20 aircraft. And so the demand, as Jim mentioned, is pretty significant. And we're ramping up as we speak to be able to deliver the customer requirements.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Jay, I'm sorry to waste a question on pension. But if we look at the CAS recoveries, it was about 30% of this year's cash flow. And I know there's discount rates and returns and all that stuff, but CAS tends to be much more visible than FAS on the income statement. So can you give us a multiyear outlook for the CAS recoveries over the next few years and where the balance stood at year-end?
Jay Malave: Yes. I mean -- so for cash this year, as we mentioned, that will decline this year. I said about $100 million. Specifically, the CAS element will decline by about -- the recoveries by about $75 million. We'll see that decline a little bit more over the next few years as well. And so it will come down in the range, I think, around $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion over the next few years. And so that's the best outlook we have today. As you know, these things are -- they do fluctuate and a little volatile. So we'll update that accordingly as we go and think about next year and what that means for 2025, Seth.
Operator: And next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. 
Peter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Jim, Jay. Jay, I wanted to just focus on Missiles and Fire Control. Just kind of obviously a little transition in growth this year, but profitability going to be down also looks like close to 90 basis points. Just maybe walk us through a little bit kind of some of the puts and takes there and just thoughts about kind of margin recovery as we think about the next couple of years where we've got all this growth inflected? Thanks.
Jay Malave: Yes. No, good question. This is something we talked a little bit on the third quarter call. We've got some new program awards, particularly in classified, that are going to put margin pressure not just next year but a few years beyond that as well. And it's really just on the early phase of these programs as we head into production. It's just low margin, and it will take time to have those restore to margins that we've seen in the past. What I will say is that we do have the benefit of some offsetting mix with the upside that we're seeing in this business. I mentioned before a potential $6 billion over the next five years. Those will come with more solid margins will help mitigate the reduction that we're seeing on these new programs. But there will be some pressure there that we have to deal with. And look, the MFC team has a good track record of driving out cost, driving margins. I'm confident they'll be able to do that in the future as well, but it will take a few years to get there.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Kristine Liwag: Good morning, everyone. Maybe switching gears to a different topic. With tighter cost of capital, we've seen valuations come down in high-growth investments. Is this a better time for corporate VC to enter into deals on attractive terms? I mean just looking at the limitations on M&As from the FTC stance that we saw with Aerojet Rocketdyne, I mean how should we think about the importance of Lockheed Martin Ventures to access these new technologies? And could we see ventures double from here?
Jim Taiclet: Kristine, this is Jim. One of the first things I did when I came from the Board to active management was to double, as you said, to double the venture fund, right? So, it was $200 million, now it's $400 million. We're actively -- actually, very actively looking to invest that additional funding. In the great scheme of the company, though, it's really designed to discover emerging technology that might be applicable to our strategy and to our products and systems and help kind of develop that technology in a way that it can have utilization earlier than perhaps otherwise for our industry. So, we get the most benefit out of our venture fund in actual operations, production and development of platforms and systems. We have had a nice upturn in the valuations of those investments as well, but they're not necessarily driving the ultimate results or the ultimate growth prospect of the company, but they're indirectly doing just that.
Jay Malave: I'll just add, Kristine, I mean it's a great point. I mean we've got a pretty tight alignment on the targets that we pursue to our technology road maps. And these are examples like Joint All Domain Operations interoperability, autonomy, artificial intelligence and other areas that will help us drive and accelerate our internal organic capability with these new emerging technologies. And so it's a great point. There's certainly opportunity there. As Jim mentioned, we've increased our availability of funding for that, and we're excited about those opportunities.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Scott Deuschle: Hey, good morning. Jay, you guys have taken a bit of a different approach on this R&D tax issue than some of your peers. And I know this subject has been beaten to death already, but I'm just curious if you've had any recent conversations with the government on whether they're going to agree with the approach you've taken. And then I guess just stepping back more broadly, you had this uncertain tax position disclosed in the 10-Q. Just kind of give us a sense for when you think that might get resolved? Thank you so much.
Jay Malave: Sure. Good question. We remain confident in the position that we've taken. We've had really no dialogue. We are awaiting guidance from the IRS on what contracts specifically would be covered. You're right that different players have taken different positions. We remain confident in our position. We believe that the risk is a factor. And when you are under particularly cost-type contracts, there is no risk taken by the provider of those services. Secondly, we believe the benefit is marginal because the owner or the contractor of that work is really the one that takes over that technology and can transfer it to others at any point in time. And so we think that those are sound base and sound arguments supported by legal teams that we have in a position that we've taken. But again, it's uncertain -- and our uncertain tax position really reflects that uncertainty. So, I can't give you specific one way or the other in terms of IRS positions because we just don't know as of yet. But I can tell you, we spent a lot of time researching this, a lot of time discussing it, deliberating it internally, and we think the position that we've come out is the right position.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. 
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. Jay, a boring inflation question for you. Are you seeing any signs that inflation is starting to ease as it works itself through your system? Or was there any mitigation for this cost inflation that is going to be flowing through from the final FY '23 budget resolution?
Jay Malave: Yes. Rob, inflation is something that we evaluate all the time. In many of our existing contracts, we have not really seen a significant impact, only because I mean our fixed price contracts -- our suppliers are under fixed price contracts with us. Where we have seen is really on new proposals is where we've seen some impacts, where you've got suppliers unwilling to provide longer-term price commitments requesting what we refer to in the industry as economic price adjustments, which are escalation clauses, inflation clauses. And those are ongoing dialogues that we have with our customers as well. And so it's still an ongoing issue. To be honest with you, on the proposal side, we really haven't seen any type of reduction there in the pressure. It's something that we review quite often on these new proposals, and it's something that we grapple with because either you have to price in some type of inflation assumption into your proposal or you have to have some type of back-to-back agreement where you're going to have an inflation clause. And we're getting squeezed with our customer as well as with our suppliers, and we're trying to make sure that we can accommodate both requirements here.
Operator: Our next question is from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
KenHerbert: Hi, good morning, Jim and Jay. Just wanted to ask a question here on the new award outlook. Putting FARA aside, if you look at NGI, maybe NGAD and other opportunities, what's the current expectations for timing around some awards, specifically around NGI? And are there other programs out there on the new award side that could significantly move the needle as we think about sort of the potential impact into '24?
Jay Malave: You think about a few of these, it's something that we have -- I mean you know that the F-35, so we've got waiting for the -- we're expecting the production order on Lot 17 in 2023. We do have a large missile -- air and missile defense program -- international program. It's an important program for us this year. And so it's probably back half of the year type of decision. That is included in our four pillars of growth when we talk about new awards. There are other programs here that are classified, really can't get into kind of the detail of those, but we expect some of those awards to be made either at the tail end of this year or into next year as well. And in NGI, we would expect to down-select around 2025. And so there's a fair amount of markers out there in some of these programs that I just spoke between now, really in 2025, that certainly are important to us. Jim mentioned FARA. That's probably a 2025 decision as well.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning. Thank you for the time, Jim and Jay. Jay, I think your margins came in a little bit better for 2023 than anticipated your guidance of about 10 bps higher. When we think about your profitability going forward, is this sort of the expected range we should expect? And of your segments, which do you think is the biggest variable? You talked about MFC and some of the challenges there. So maybe if you could talk about that.
Jay Malave: Yes. Let me maybe talk a bit in the kind of longer-term outlook. And you look at the history of Lockheed Martin over the last probably five to 10 years, and we've reached margins in the range of 12%. I do believe we have the potential to get back to those, but that will take time. In the short term, really, I would say, over the next three years or so, our objective will be just to hold the margins where they are because some of these pressures that we see on these new programs, particularly at MFC, when you've got a 90 basis point reduction in one year from -- in one BA, that's a lot to really overcome. We've worked things internally as far as both product cost reductions, overhead cost reductions to really try to drive and maintain our margin profile. But that's where we're really going to be over the next few years is really trying to maintain where we are as we re-crank the growth cycle. And I think that's the key message that we have had internally: let's re-crank the growth cycle, get ourselves in 2024 on track to deliver the growth. As we get that flywheel turning, then we'll be able to focus and turn back around on margins and start improving margins.
Operator: Next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. 
DougHarned: Good morning. Thank you. On F-35, so when you get ready to restart here, you've also though now flown the F-35 with tech refresh upgrade -- or Tech Refresh 3 upgrade. Can you talk about how that's progressing, how Tech Refresh 3 is progressing? And how does the progress there play into your delivery plans for Lots 15 through 17? And perhaps you might also comment on, when you get the restart, you've got these airplanes that have already been produced. Should we see those as really add-ons to 2023 deliveries?
Jim Taiclet: So Doug, let me take the first portion of your question, it's Jim, and then turn it over to Jay for the second piece on delivery numbers, et cetera. So Tech Refresh 3 is really important in a couple of dimensions. And you're accurate in mentioning and thank you for the first flight with the TR3 upgraded hardware and software was literally just a few weeks ago. We've got more software releases to go. We're going to add capability over the next couple of months. But we expect production of TR3-capable aircraft hopefully in this -- during the course of this year. That's our expectation. Now what that does for the customer and for us and our strategy is really kind of two major dimensions. One is for the capability of the aircraft itself. It will be able to handle more weapons. It will be able to upgrade electronic warfare capabilities. It will be able to accomplish more missions. So the basic functionality of the aircraft alone by itself is going to be elevated significantly by the insertion of this technology. And what is this technology? It's an updated core processor. So the -- basically the server for the airplane that it carries with it is going to the next-generation upgrade. The data storage is going to be vastly improved. And then the display is going to be modernized for the pilot, so what they see, how they interact with the jet and with other aircraft and systems around it. So those three things, right, data processing capability and speeds, data storage capacity, and the ability to interconnect with basically a modernized interface for the pilot along with the better capabilities they're going to have to interact with other aircraft to other systems because of TR3 are all of the characteristics that you need for an edge compute node in a modern 5G Internet of Things system and architecture, right? The three things are data storage, multi-cloud connection and processing power and speed. So we've actually killed two birds with one stone with TR3 here. On one hand, the aircraft is going to be much more capable in the kind of its traditional role. On the second hand, it's going to be way more capable, perhaps uniquely capable, in sort of the network Internet of Things or Joint All-Domain Operations of the future, right? That's what our customer calls that. So we have now the computing power and the capacity to serve as sort of the central aerial component of our 21st Century Security open architecture concept. And that's really the two pieces of F-35, TR3. They're super important. One is the airplane itself; and second, its ability to network with other systems and aircraft in an IoT-based architecture open architecture. Jay, do you want to speak to that?
Jay Malave: Sure. To answer the question on add-ons, that is -- will be -- that will occur but not necessarily in 2023. If you think about it right now, we're going to be introducing and cutting in new production, hardware and software on a full rate production program, which is a pretty aggressive schedule. And so what I would expect -- and this is included in our sustainment revenue growth projections, we'll see the retrofits on the existing fleet over time. And that will probably start beginning maybe sometime in 2024 and beyond, and its part of our mid-single-digit sustainment growth on the F-35.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Matt Akers: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask, I think you had mentioned some of the restocking of stuff Ukraine and you've got some orders there. How big is that for Lockheed Martin? And how should we think about sort of the timing? And how accretive that might be the growth maybe in '24 and beyond? 
Jay Malave: Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got about -- we had orders of about $1.5 billion. We'll start delivering on some of that in 2023, and that will carry over into 2024. We've got a line of sight to significantly more orders beyond that, that we'll see again in the outer years. And so it's still to be determined. But what I can say is that we have had contract funding and internally funded projects to make sure we can meet higher ramp rates, whether it's HIMARS, GMLRS, PAC-3, all of those, all are opportunities from where we are today and part of the investment that our customer is making and that we are making to drive the higher ramp rates.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. And Matt, it's Jim. One of the issues that this situation has illuminated with is that when you need to accelerate production in the defense enterprise for national defense, we would have liked to have been able to A, ramp up the production faster and B, bringing the revenue sooner. So it just highlights the need, I think, and it's an urgent one, to work together with government and industry to quickly evolve the relationship between the two so that we can maintain an effective deterrent conflict as we've talked about. So what I'm discussing with some of our senior government officials who are receptive, and there are several thought leaders in government on this now, is apply the concept of anti-fragility to the relationship between government and industry, meaning things like ensure that we have multiple reliable sources of key materials and components, right? So we have a lot of single-source components that we have to go back down into our supply chain and find out who and if they can double or triple their production of the components so we can double or triple the output of the system. Another piece of this anti-fragility concept is to have the government invest in production capacity with us, call it, 2 standard deviations above the mean peace time production rates. So if you need to accelerate, you can quickly and start up the line or speed up the line much faster. Another one is significant, expansion of the use of long-term and multiyear contracts so that we don't have to have a fluctuation in demand year-to-year, which sets our supply base back, again, less willing to invest because they can't predict the future. And then finally, especially for those small and medium businesses, we're suggesting that government really take an overview of a broad overview of the oversight and compliance burdens that are on companies that participate in the defense industrial base from an audit and compliance and certified cost perspective, truth and negotiation act, things like that, while we at Lockheed Martin and other major defense funds would like to see that burden ease, it's a burden that can really prohibit other medium and small companies from working with us or working with the government to provide what it needs. So there's a great dialogue beginning. I'm sure other companies are raising these issues too. But this issue of restocking raised an important industry issue that we're going to try to work with government to solve.
Maria Ricciardone Lee: Great. John, this is Maria. I think we've come to the top of the hour here, so I'll turn it back to Jim for any last thoughts.
Jim Taiclet: Great. Thanks, Maria. I'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire Lockheed Martin community for everything they've done in 2022 and they'll do this year and beyond. Together, we positioned our company to continue to push the edge of the technology and advance scientific discovery to ensure our customers remain what we call ahead of ready and keep people safe around the globe. So thanks again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next call in April. John, that concludes the call. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-18 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, John, and good morning. I’d like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer; and Maria Ricciardone Lee, our new Vice President of Investor Relations.  Statements made in today’s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today’s press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today’s call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 earnings call as we review our quarterly results, our 2022 full-year outlook, and our preliminary expectations for 2023. But before we begin, I’d like to welcome Maria, who I’m excited to tell you all, has started as our new Vice President of Investor Relations just yesterday. I’d also like to thank Greg, who announced his plan to retire at the end of the year for his more than 37 years of dedicated service at Lockheed Martin, including five terrific years as our Vice President of Investor Relations. It’s been a pleasure to work with you, Greg, and we wish you all the best in retirement.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, Jim.
Jim Taiclet: I’d also like to note that we continue to await the U.S. Army’s selection for its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft competition, FLRAA, as it is known. We’ll modernize the Army’s rotorcraft fleet and represent a long-term franchise growth opportunity. We are confident that DEFIANT X is the transformational aircraft that the U.S. Army’s going to need to accomplish its complex missions today and well into the future, and we look forward to the Army’s announcement. Lockheed Martin had a solid quarter financially with 3% increase in sales from last year’s third quarter, and strong operating margins and earnings per share. Our free cash flow was outstanding as we generated $2.7 billion in the quarter. And our backlog grew nearly $5 billion, closing at $140 billion. We remain on track to achieve the full year outlook for all of our financial metrics that we discussed last quarter. In a few minutes, Jay will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2022 guidance and trending information. But before he does that, I will provide a framework for our outlook, and discuss our plans for delivering value to customers and shareholders over the next several years. We continue to anticipate growth over the long term, but with the residual pandemic impacts and supply chain challenges continuing, we now expect a return to growth in 2024 with 2023 sales being approximately equal to our 2022 outlook. We are confident in our four pillars to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Importantly, we expect to deliver solid growth and free cash flow per share in 2023 and thereafter through a combination of cost reductions throughout the business, improved working capital management, and an expanded share of purchase program. Our Board of Directors has approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization to $14 billion. You will see in Jay’s charts that we’re doubling our share repurchase plan outlook for this year, increasing our outlook by $4 billion for a total expectation of $8 billion in 2022. We also announced a 7% dividend increase this quarter. So altogether, we’re on track to deliver approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022. We are also elevating our commitment to drive long-term growth through strong independent research and development and capital expenditure funding with an expected total of nearly $4 billion in 2023. These investments will support our customers and deliver on our 21st century security vision to accelerate leading edge, commercial digital technologies, and defense of our nation and allies. A key driver of this strategy is our new One LM transformation, or as we call it, One LMX, [ph] a multi-billion-dollar, seven-year company-wide program to transform our end-to-end business processes and systems. One LMX will create a model-based enterprise with a fully integrated digital thread throughout the design, build, and sustained product lifecycle. As part of our ongoing corporate stewardship approach, we are conducting an internal review to identify potential synergies between our four business areas, further cost reduction opportunities, and a general portfolio review with the goal of increasing operating efficiency in anticipation of our future growth. We are confident in long term growth as domestic and international demand for a wide range of our products and services remain strong. We will continue to actively reinvest capital into our business to meet our customers’ requirements and drive organic growth, and we’ll use our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process and strong balance sheet to drive attractive total returns for shareholders. Moving on, I’d like to highlight a few key accomplishments from each of our business areas, beginning with an update on our F-35 program. Last month, the Swiss government signed a letter of offer and acceptance for the procurement of 36 F-35As. This milestone completes the government-to-government procurement process that was first announced in June 2021 when the Swiss Federal Council shared its selection of the F-35 for its future fighter. The signing officially makes Switzerland the 15th F-35 customer. Also, in August, we received contractual authorization from the Joint Program Office, enabling us to book a Lot 15 order of over $7.5 billion and recognize revenues and earnings from the second quarter as well as from the third quarter. Our Space team celebrated the successful launch and deployment of the space-based infrared system GEO-6 satellite, the final spacecraft in the SBIRS constellation. SBIRS has been one of our longest running signature programs, providing the Space Force with an integrated system for missile warning, battlespace awareness, and intelligence gathering. We will also continue to support and advance this important mission through our next generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or next gen OPIR program, which will deliver even more advanced and more survivable missile warning capabilities to the country. At Rotary and Mission Systems, the Sikorsky line of business secured an order for 12 SEAHAWK helicopters from the Australian Ministry of Defense. Over the past 40 years, we’ve delivered over a 1,000 SEAHAWKs to the U.S. and international customers both with more than 50 remaining in backlog. And in Missiles and Fire Control, the State Department approved a potential sale to the United Arab Emirates for two THAAD systems, including 96 interceptors. The UAE currently operates two THAAD batteries, and this opportunity would significantly increase their air and missile defense capabilities, and once finalized, could be worth over $2.2 billion. Turning to budgets, both chambers of Congress have advanced Appropriation bills in support of fiscal year 2023 Department of Defense budgets. We have seen strong bipartisan support for increased defense funding in congressional authorization and appropriation committees. Final legislation approving these funds has yet to be passed, and the federal government is currently operating under a short term continuing resolution for FY23, limiting DOD funding to prior FY 2022 levels. As part of the continuing resolution, Congress did approve additional supplemental spending to support efforts in Ukraine for the defense of their country. The CR added $3 billion in funding for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiatives, a program to provide equipment, weapons, and military support to Ukraine, bringing the total amount appropriated for this effort to $9 billion. In addition, the continuing resolution appropriated $2 billion to replenish U.S. stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine and to increase production of critical munitions with a presidential drawdown authority funding now having been increased to over $14 billion since the beginning of the year. The international community has also increased their focus on global security with nations across the world having announced a planned five-year increase in defense budget funding of approximately $60 billion in total. We continue to have discussions with customers to expand the manufacturing of multiple products and have submitted offers for consideration. While many of these contracting actions remain in the early stages and may take time to be fully implemented, we believe our signature programs and 21st century security technologies have us well positioned to address the challenges presented by a resurgence in global great power competition. Turning to our 21st century security strategy, I’d like to highlight two examples of Lockheed Martin’s leadership in deterrence technologies and how our 5G.MIL open architecture can be used to enhance performance and drive effective Joint All-Domain Operations?  During the third quarter, Lockheed Martin and AT&T teamed to transfer UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter flight and performance data from an aircraft at flying in Connecticut to receiving location in Colorado, using both an AT&T 5G private cellular network and Lockheed Martin’s 5G.MIL multi-site pilot network. Operational performance was also improved with the efficiencies introduced by this technology, shortening the total processing time of the task by nearly 85%. Also this quarter, Lockheed Martin and Verizon flew 5G enabled drones to capture and securely transfer high speed, real time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data from aircraft and flight to geolocate simulated adversarial positions. This demonstration showed the capabilities of our hybrid base station to bridge commercial and military technologies together, providing our service members with enhanced deterrent capabilities and further enabling the mission all the way out to the actual battlefield. With that, I will turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions.
Jay Malave: Thanks Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail, provide an update to our 2022 outlook as well as offer some thoughts on 2023 and beyond. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let’s begin with chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated third quarter financials. Lockheed Martin delivered solid results for the quarter. To start, we generated sequential sales growth of 7% to $16.6 billion, as anticipated. Segment operating profit was $1.9 billion at an 11.2% margin with earnings per share of $6.71, reflecting solid underlying performance that absorbed $0.16 of mark to market headwinds. We also increased backlog with a 1.3 book-to-bill ratio, driven by the F-35 production Lot 15 contract action. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $2.7 billion, further enabling the execution of our disciplined and dynamic cash deployment strategy and returning over $2 billion through share purchases and dividends.  Turning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on chart 4. Total sales increased 3% from the third quarter of 2021 with growth in three of our four business areas. Segment operating profit was up slightly, as the benefits from higher volume and equity earnings more than offset lower step-ups than last year. Moving to earnings per share on chart 5. On a reported basis, earnings per share were higher by $4.50. Adjusting for last year’s pension transfer transaction and mark to market accounting, EPS grew 4%, primarily reflecting the benefits of higher operating profit and the lower share count. All in all, solid results that position us well to meet our full-year commitments.  Moving to cash flow on chart 6, we delivered our strongest quarter of cash flow year-to-date, with strong collections driving $2.7 billion in free cash flow this quarter while maintaining accelerated payments of $1.1 billion to suppliers. Shareholder cash deployment continues to exceed free cash flow year-to-date with 121% of free cash flow deployed through dividends and share repurchases. We have substantially completed our $4 billion -- our original $4 billion 2022 buyback target. As we announced this quarter, we also increased our dividend 7%, now paying an annualized dividend of $12 per share. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on chart 7. Third quarter sales increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher F-35 production volume, including the recognition of $325 million of sales that were deferred from the second quarter associated with the Lot 15 contract action. Increased volume in our classified programs at Skunk Works also contributed to the growth. Operating profit increased 6%, primarily following the sales volume increases on F-35, partially offset by lower margins on classified programs. Moving to Missiles and Fire Control on page 8. Sales increased 2%, driven primarily by increased volume on PAC-3 interceptors. Segment operating profit was down 8% as lower favorable profit adjustments this quarter more than offset the benefit from higher volume. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page 9, sales decreased year-over-year by 5%, driven primarily by lower Black Hawk production volume at Sikorsky. Operating profit decreased 10%, following Sikorsky production volume and lower favorable profit adjustments this quarter on the Black Hawk program. Turning to chart 10 in our Space business area. Sales were up 7%, driven primarily by the continued ramp of the next-generation interceptor program. Operating profit increased 14% following the volume increase, along with higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Okay. Moving to our updated outlook for 2022 on page 11. We are maintaining our guidance from last quarter for sales, earnings per share and free cash flow. With the announcement this morning of a $14 billion repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors, we’ve increased our forecast for share buybacks to approximately $8 billion for the year, an increase of $4 billion from our prior expectation, reflecting our confidence in the long-term growth outlook and amplifying per share value creation. We expect the EPS benefit from our incremental planned buybacks this year to be offset by the third quarter mark-to-market headwinds and therefore are holding our current EPS guide of $21.55 for the year. Also, while our consolidated outlook did not change, we did have some puts and takes between the business areas, and you can find that detail in our backlog charts. On chart 12, we’ve laid out our preliminary framework of expectations for 2023. As we’ve discussed before, we remain confident in sustained growth, driven by four pillars: those are programs of record, classified programs, hypersonics, and new awards. This is supported by the higher backlog through the third quarter and further growth expected by year-end. We do anticipate flattish sales in 2023, however, primarily due to the delayed sales conversion in our programs of record backlog as the expected recovery from COVID and supply chain shortages will be more gradual than previously expected. In our classified businesses, we expect another year of growth in 2023. This growth, along with our contract mix headwinds, will be accompanied by pressure of approximately 20 to 30 basis points in overall company segment operating margin, all compared to our 2022 outlook. We are confident that through cost reduction and business area synergy actions, we can work to limit this downward pressure. Importantly, through management focus and aggressive working capital actions, our expectations for 2023 free cash flow remain unchanged in spite of the top line and margin pressure. Looking forward, we are confident in the Company’s prospects for growth and value creation. With our aggressive share buyback plan, we anticipate repurchasing approximately 10% of our shares outstanding over the next several years. And coupled with a sustained free cash flow, we expect to deliver outstanding long-term value to shareholders. Okay. So, let’s wrap up on chart 13. Our business area operational and financial performance in the third quarter was solid, and we are increasing our outlook for cash return to shareholders. We continue to invest in innovative solutions, including commercial technologies in support of our customers’ important missions and 21st Century Security. Our focus remains on strong cash generation, and combined with our robust balance sheet and discipline and dynamic capital deployment strategy allow us to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Before we open up to Q&A, I would also like to thank Greg Gardner for his 37 years of dedicated service and contributions to the Company. He’s been an outstanding partner and resource to all that he has supported. We wish him well in the next phase of his life. Greg will remain with us through the end of the year to transition Maria Ricciardone Lee. Maria brings Investor Relations experience from multiple companies, including UTX where we both worked together. She’s an excellent financial executive and thought partner, and I’m excited that she is joining the team. With that, John, let’s open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we have line of Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. Also, I’d say all the best to Greg, and welcome, Maria, the two of you again. But in terms of questions, Jay, on your outlook for 2023, I know you’re not going to go into a lot of detail here, full guidance be going next quarter. But you mentioned that classified is going to be going up but overall are going to be flattish. So, what’s coming down next year, and what’s causing that?
Jay Malave: Yes. We have some program transitions, Rob. And maybe I’ll just maybe go through around some of the business areas to give you a little bit of color there. When you look at aero next year, we expect that to probably be in the range of being down -- flat to down slightly. And that’s on the back really of lower production volume on the F-35. We expect that to be done -- even though sales -- or the deliveries will be generally flat. We recorded sales in advance of that with long lead procurement in 2021 and 2022. So, it will be a period of catch-up on sales for aero there. So, that’s going to be the biggest driver there, but we’ll expect that to abate when we go into 2024. At MFC, we’ve got some -- just some timing, so program timing, particularly in our sensors business, we expect them to be probably flattish to down slightly as well. And then, we expect some growth -- low-single-digit growth at both RMS and Space. And RMS will just be driven by new programs. And at Space, we have -- our national security business is down, but we’ve got other programs that are spiking up there. And so, that’s generally what’s driving it, I’d say, by business area and by segment. So slightly down in a few and slightly up in others, and our balance will be flat.
Operator: And our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Jim, can you walk through why you think growth is going to start again in 2024? I mean, what underlies that? And maybe one of the things I scratched my head on a bunch is you’ve got, what, the 15th customer for F-35. It looks like there might even be some more within the next year or so. So, how do we think about that growth recovery? What’s going to underlie that? And why are F-35 levels at a higher rate of production than where they are today? And could they go higher?
Jim Taiclet: Sure. Ryan, it’s Jim here. So, the two biggest pieces of our four pillars of growth are programs of record, and I’ll speak to a few of those in a second, and the classified business we have. And both of those are going to ramp up from 2023 to 2024 meaningly we feel. And the biggest piece of all -- again, the programs of record are going to come into 3 or 4 very identifiable areas. One is the F-35 sustainment, right? So with more aircraft out flying, there’s going to be more of a overhaul, repair, spare parts support, those kinds of activities, going on. And that’s going to continue over a number of years. So F-35 sustainment is a growth area. In MFC, the PAC-3 is resurging. There’s interest in various parts of the world, the Middle East, Europe and Asia now, for PAC-3. So the capabilities of that air defense system are really going to be kicking into gear for the Company in the next couple of years, including in 2024. Along with that, similarly, the CH-53K is going to move up the production rate significantly, and there’s some additional international interest there. That aircraft can do lift capability that far exceeds any other that’s ever been built in history. And it’s, I think, going to get even more uptake as time goes on. And the fourth among many of the programs of record that will grow is fleet ballistic missile that the U.S. Navy is essentially going to revamp for the second time the Trident fleet ballistic missile system. And that’s a Lockheed Martin franchise that will continue to grow, again starting in 2024. On the classified side, 2023 is helpful, but not really the ramp that will come in 2024. So, between programs of record and classified, you’re going to get the bulk of that growth. On F-35, the U.S. government has got to kind of determine what its budget priorities are at the macro level going forward. One of those has been nuclear deterrents. And so, between the bomber program, the ground-based missile recapitalization and the fleet ballistic missile that I just mentioned, there’s going to be a significant amount of defense budget proportionately spent on the nuclear revitalization. But also the conventional threats have gotten worse instead of better as we look forward into the next 2 or 3, 4 years, and that’s going to be a budget issue for the U.S. government. We’ve recommended, and I think the services would support, a steady production rate of 156 aircraft starting again in the 2024 time frame when we can get back up to that based on the COVID recovery for our supply chain. And I think that’s supportable. And it takes about 80 U.S. aircraft to make that happen per year with another 75 or so coming from international. We see the international demand -- and it’s going to be up to the U.S. government to try to support that 80 number between the congressional committee processes for authorization and appropriation along with the President’s budgets going forward. So, we hope for that. We expect it because that’s the need, and that’s where we think the F-35 program is going to go. But again, in FY23, we won’t have that full ramp-up yet.
Jay Malave: Let me just -- to maybe add a little bit to it as well, Ron. Just to augment, some of the things that we’re seeing in 2023, we’ve got some expected abating headwinds when we go into 2024. Jim mentioned a little bit on supply chain. That’s primarily affected our programs of record. And so, those should lift by the time we get to 2024. We also have a few program transitions in 2023 that will also allow for easier comparison when we get into 2024. And so for example, I just mentioned the F-35 where production will be down next year. Those will normalize when we get into 2024, which will allow our sustainment to grow, as Jim mentioned. We’ll also see accelerated growth in the F-16 program. As you may recall, that program slipped to the right, but in 2024, we expect that to accelerate. In Space, as Jim mentioned, FBM, there are other programs such as NGI that will continue to grow. And so we’ve got some things where we’re cycling down this -- on 2023 on the SBIRS program and even things like next-gen GEO or OPIR, again, those headwinds will abate as we get into 2024. Similarly, on MFC, Jim mentioned the PAC-3 program. We’ll see also continued growth there in the classified programs as well. And then at RMS, as Jim mentioned, also at CH-53K, there’s also other radar programs as well as Joint All Domain-type programs like Defense of Guam that will drive some growth in those years. So, all of these areas and these programs are the ones that we have pretty clear visibility to. They do assume obviously that there is abatement to an improvement in supply chain. That’s 15 months from now for improvement that we expect to occur.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Matt Akers: Greg, best of luck and good working with you. I wanted to ask about Future Vertical Lift, FLRAA, just what you’re hearing from your customers there on the delays? And any indication of what’s driving that? And when do you think that contract might be up?
Jim Taiclet: Matt, it’s Jim. The only thing we could say about the schedule for FLRAA decision is what the U.S. government puts out publicly. So, we don’t have anything else to add to that. It’s their schedule and time line, and we think we’ve put in a terrific offer. And also having been around some of these helicopter pilots in my Air Force time, they actually scared the heck out of me a couple of times when I flew with them. They want to be low. They want to be maneuverable below the tree line. And I’ve seen the FARA and FLRAA fly. They can do it. There’s a video you can look at on YouTube that shows you how amazing this helicopter technology is. And it also gets you up to like a 230- to 250-knot forward speed when you need it. So, it gives the best of both worlds if you’re in the rotorcraft business as a flyer. You get good forward speed that’s faster than it’s ever been for a traditionally designed helicopter because of our counter-rotating rotors. And it also gives you the maneuverability even better than many of the traditional helicopters could have provided. So, we think it’s the best solution for the actual frontline Army or other service pilot, and it’s going to be up the U.S. government to see where they come out on that. But the schedule is theirs, and we can’t really comment on it.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Greg, enjoy retirement. Jim, I had a question on Missiles and Fire Control. I feel like the last few years, you’ve had -- production programs have been down, but you mentioned this resurgence in the PAC-3. And U.S.A., it seemed like the guys were pretty positive on a range of production programs, HIMARS, for instance, being one of them because of what we’ve seen in the papers. But if we think about the midterm at Missiles and Fire Control with this kind of resurgence in the production programs, is there a margin opportunity there now that you guys are seeing, whereas maybe the production programs kind of start to shift back versus some of the hypersonic development projects?
Jim Taiclet: So, Pete, I’d say, yes, the legacy but still extremely effective MFC programs are fairly high margin because of the volume and the learning curve that were already down. So that will be a margin upside to us, should those volumes increase further. And we’ve gotten ahead of this. So, for HIMARS, GMLRS, Javelin, again, the products you kind of see in the news these days and a few others as well. About 6, 7 months ago when we saw what was beginning to happen in Eastern Europe, I went over to visit some of the senior officials in the Pentagon and basically took them a letter and said, we’re going to start spending on capacity for a few of these systems, including the ones you just asked about. And now we’ve got a lot done already. So for example, on HIMARS specifically, we’ve already met with our long lead supply chain to plan for increasing production in 96 of these units a year. We advanced funded ahead of contract $65 million to shorten the manufacturing lead time. That was without a contract or any other even memo or whatnot back from the government. We just went ahead and did that because we expected it to happen. So, those parts are already being manufactured now. The third thing we did was we’ve determined where we could open up another modern manufacturing facility to be able to produce the products and got it ready early, and we’re cross-training our skilled workforce across a bunch of product lines. So, as the demand grows and shifts across some of these products over the next few years, we’re going to have people that kind of fungibly move between them. And then, the last thing we did was going back to this One LMX, we’re putting the best and newest manufacturing technology into some of these product lines first so that when the ramp comes, we can pivot to it quicker. So, those are some of the things that we’ve done to actually capture some of the volume we expect to get. And we do expect to get it, both from the U.S. to refill stocks, as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, and also significant interest being shown. Now, it’s got to go ahead and get contracted, which as we discussed last call, it can take a couple of years to get all that done, especially for an FMS contract. But we know it’s -- the demand is there, and we’ve spoken to the senior government officials from those countries that know that this is important for them.
Jay Malave: Just -- Pete, just to follow up on that. We do expect some sales upside there on some of these programs that Jim mentioned. That is likely to be in -- probably starting in the 2020 time frame given the long cycle nature of where we are in spite of the fact that we’ve done some advanced funding. The other thing I just have to also mention is that where we see the margin pressure next year, a lot of that is driven at MFC. And so, while we will see a mix benefit associated from these higher-margin programs, that is probably more in 2024 and beyond. 2023, we’ll see a step down from where they are this year in 2022. And the way to think about it is, in the third quarter, MFC did about 13.5. What’s implied in our guide for the fourth quarter is high-13s. They’re going to be in that mid-13 range, in that ballpark, for 2023 given some of these new increases in the programs that we’ve invested in. And so, we’ll see a little bit of pressure there across the company, really driven by MFC. But again, we’ll see some of those mix benefits come back to us in ‘24 and beyond.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. And best of luck, Greg. Thank you. And good morning, Jim and Jay. Jay, one for you maybe, I want to ask about the share repurchase authorization increase in the dividend raise. Can you talk about how you’re thinking about deployment as a percentage of free cash flow going forward? And what were some of the assumptions made around the R&D tax credit perhaps in the expected use of debt? And just maybe adjacent to that, as you think about market multiples coming down and some of these smaller companies needing to potentially prime -- pair up with prime, how do you think about taking advantage of that opportunity along with the share repurchase authorization? Thank you.
Jay Malave: Okay. There’s a lot there. So, let me maybe start with the share repurchase. As I mentioned -- both Jim and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we’re confident in the long-term outlook of the Company. We saw this as an opportunity to really amplify the value creation that we see over the long term. And we saw no better time than really now to get started on that here in the fourth quarter. The profile to think about going forward is $4 billion here in the fourth quarter, $4 billion in 2023, $4 billion in 2024 and maybe $2 billion in 2025 as a starting point. And so, that’s the profile we should expect it to be. As far as debt, we do -- are going to finance this fourth quarter share repurchase program with the issuance of debt. So, it will be about $4 billion. That will increase our interest expense next year. But again, it’s all accretive. And so, we’ll see that. Again, our debt leverage ratio on an EBITDA basis will put us still below -- at or below 1.5 times. So, it’s still very supportable and also very attractive. As far as the R&D tax capitalization, really nothing’s changed at the moment. We’ll see what happens as we move forward here in the fourth quarter. First things first, we got to get through the November elections. And then we have the expiration of the existing continuing resolution on December 16th. It’s possible through legislation, therefore, a new budget that we could see movement on tax extenders that would include some type of either deferral or what we would prefer a repeal of the task capitalization policy. And as you know, we believe that it’s sound policy, and we believe there’s bipartisan support to remove any disincentives that promote innovation. And so, that’s a firm policy. It’s something that we’re firmly behind and we’ll continue to push for.
Jim Taiclet: Sheila, when it comes to small and midsized companies teaming up with Lockheed Martin, we’re set up for that. I can describe three ways in which we are ready now to pair up and team up with whether they’re commercial or defense, industrial-based companies of smaller scale. One is that we’ve had for years, LM Ventures, like literally a VC house inside of Lockheed Martin. It’s been funded at $200 million level originally. The investments that have been made under that authorization are now worth about $400 million. So even if we mark to market a little bit lower, we had basically 100% return on that initial investment. Seeing the success when I joined the company of the LM Ventures program a couple of years ago, we went ahead doubled the authorization. So, we’re looking where to invest another $200 million in early-stage companies. At the next level, I motivated the team, and Jay helped us create what we can now call Lockheed Martin Evolve or LM Evolve, E-V-O-L-V-E. And what that’s meant to do is to go at a step higher and say, how do we do joint ventures or commercial alliances with midsized companies, co-invest, et cetera, whether again, there on the commercial side or the defense industrial base side or space industry in ways that we can take that outside of our rate structure and manage it and fund it in a different, more creative way? So, we’re in the VC space with LM Ventures. We’re in the midsized page -- space with LM Evolve, which is just literally getting off the ground, I’ll say. But we have the framework, the structure and the ability to engage in that level of investment now. And then thirdly, something we’ve done over the years is acquire small and medium companies with technologies or critical supply chain components that are available. So, we’ll continue to do that as well. So, those are the three routes that we have in place up and running: LM Ventures, LM Evolve and the acquisition process to bring those kind of capabilities into -- or an affiliation with Lockheed Martin.
Operator: And next, we’ll go to Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Spingarn: Best of luck, Greg. Jim, I wanted to ask you a high-level question, particularly because you’re a pilot. The Air Force is facing a shortage of pilots, and the Navy is planning to have at least 60% of the carrier air wings uncrewed. And so, given that Lockheed is so strong on manned aircraft, I wanted to ask you about unmanned and the positioning there and how that fits into the long-term plans of both the Air Force and the Navy.
Jim Taiclet: So Rob, autonomy is 1 of the 14 critical technologies that we think are essential in the 21st century. And to everyone’s credit at the company, we’ve been investing in Skunk Works and other parts of the Company, including Sikorsky, in autonomy for 15-plus years, right? This is not an easy thing to do or an easy thing to get approved or regulated. But Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky, when it was part of UTC and thereafter, had been working on autonomy for quite some time. So, the Aeronautics side of it, I can’t say much about because it’s pretty highly classified. But we’re far down the road on crewed, uncrewed teaming. And in the January call, we expect to have hit a couple of milestones in that, that I’ll be able to explain in some more detail, but we want to get the testing done before we talk about it. But we’re far down the road there, mainly out of Skunk Works, as I said. And then, on the rotorcraft side, if you get the Aviation Week from maybe 3 or 4 months ago that showed a Sikorsky helicopter flying around with no people in it, right? I’ve actually flown in the Matrix helicopter, we call it, which is a DARPA project that’s run out of Sikorsky. It has three -- and they all work, by the way. It has three modes. One is manual mode, just like any traditional helicopter. The second mode is sort of assisted like a Tesla, so to speak, right? So, you can take over if you need to or if you want to change the flight instantly. And then, the third mode is fully automated. And it -- you plug the mission in a trailer down or up at Stratford, Connecticut, thing will take off, go do the mission and come back and land on itself. So, it’s really working already. And then, it’s a matter of when is the U.S. government and the service is ready to turn these technologies into programs of record, but we’ll be ready when they are.
Operator: Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Let me join everybody and say thank you, Greg, for a great job done. And Maria, welcome. So, we haven’t talked about inflation. What are you guys seeing and assuming in inflation going forward? And as you know, Bill LaPlante has basically suggested that DoD should kind of kick in to help companies because the current level of inflation was not anticipated where the -- when the contracts were signed. And yet Senator Elizabeth Warren, no big surprise, is saying that’s not a good idea. So what are you seeing in inflation? And what are you assuming going forward in terms of DoD support?
Jay Malave: Sure, Cai. Inflation is twofold: one on our own labor front and then in what we see in supply chain. And for our portfolio of business is a fair amount of our business that’s somewhat insulated because it’s not fixed price. And so, some of the cost-plus benefits that we get, that risk is not held at Lockheed Martin. For the 60% of our business that is fixed price, a lot of our just contracting policies and actions and implementations revolve around going back to back with our supply chain, meaning that whatever duration of time that we commit in our contract with our customer, we have the same commitment to our supply chain to us over that same period of time. And so in many of those cases, we don’t bear that risk either. But it does come into factor as we’re going into new bids and proposals with our customer. We are seeing different changes both on the labor side and in supply chain, and it does have an impact really going forward on bid and proposals. It’s something that we have to keep in front of us. And we’re having dialogues with the customer. As you mentioned, there’s been a little bit of a shift in policy to DoD as far as acceptance of economic price adjustments, and that’s something that we do continue to have dialogue with our customers on. In existing contracts, that’s subject to funding availability, which has been somewhat difficult to actually obtain. But I think going forward, that’s something that certainly would be part of our negotiations and part of our contracting. As far as labor is concerned, we have increased our assumptions in our existing backlog contracts. We’ve been able to absorb that through productivity and other management reserve type of actions. So, we’ve not really seen much of an impact there, but it’s certainly a watch item as we go forward.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: I echo everyone in best to Greg and to Maria. Going to try and sneak two in here real quick. Just on -- Jay, the Wall Street Journal has you this morning saying that growth in 2024 should be low single digits. Is that right? Is that how we should think about it? And then the second one, I wonder if you could help us with the pension outlook for next year, both FAS and CAS. And then just thinking about the CAS outlook beyond 2024 and how that remaining balance kind of trails off in the coming years.
Jay Malave: Sure, Seth. Yes, I think low single digit for 2024 as a baseline is the way you should look at it. We talked on this call today that there are some upside opportunities to that baseline. Missiles and Fire Control is certainly a prime opportunity. Jim talked about opportunities related to HIMARS and other programs. And so, there could be upside from where we are today. These are ongoing dialogues we’re having with our DoD customers. So, it’s hard to really put them into a firm forecast until we get ourselves a clearer picture in terms of what’s going to be under contract and the timing of those deliveries. So, I would say low single-digit baseline is the appropriate level to be. We’re getting better clarity and I think we’ll have a lot more clarity come January, provide our full guidance for 2023 and a better outlook on 2024. As far as pension’s involved, we do expect the FAS income to come down. You’re talking in the range of say $50 million. On the CAS side, we expect the CAS cost to come down as well by about $75 million. So the FAS/CAS adjustment all in, we’re expecting to come down by about $125 million. That’s if we struck things today. As you know, at the end of the year, we’ll have to true up and formally change, but that’s based on what we see today. As far as CAS is involved, we’re going to have to get back to you in ‘24 and beyond in that. Greg will have to come back to you Seth on that.
Operator: Next question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: Greg, congratulations, and welcome, Maria. Jim and Jay, thank you for providing color on the specific headwinds in 2023. But maybe taking a step back for a 30,000-foot view, the defense budget environment is pretty robust. We saw the ‘22 budget request up mid-single digit. The Ukraine military aid so far adds another 10% to the ‘22 modernization budget. So, your book-to-bill also year-to-date is 1.1x. I guess I would have thought that these items could have offset the specific 2023 headwinds you called out. So maybe absent the specific programs you mentioned, should we expect the portfolio to grow above the low or in line with the overall DoD budget?
Jim Taiclet: So Kristine, good morning. I would say, first of all, that the defense budget is expected to go above and beyond what the President’s original submission was a few months back in 2023, right? Now, even if that happens, and we do expect it to happen, and I would just point out a couple of programs that probably would benefit from that and that includes C-130 in that and F-35 production. But it hasn’t happened yet, so we’re not putting it into our forecast. And let me just take a minute to step back and really reemphasize what Jay said, in that we don’t have enough real information right now in the -- early in the fourth quarter of the year to even give much more than an estimate of what the trend will be next year. So starting in 2024, we’re going to start doing January guidance that’s formal. We’re not going to do anything ahead of that. And I’ll tell you the three issues that I’ve learned in my couple of years in management here, we just don’t have clarity on. One is the defense budget, which you just raised a minute ago. We don’t know what it’s going to be. In January, we’ll know what the defense budget is going to be. And then along with that, what’s the status of the major orders and contracts that get put into that budget because as you’re again pointing out, what’s the mix of the budget increase going to be as far as what the contracts and orders come from that. And then finally, we don’t necessarily have status of what the supply chain health is going to be, even in 2023 yet because if there’s another COVID spike in the winter like there was last time, we’re going to have effects in our supply chain. So, there’s -- those three issues really makes it, I think, almost impossible to give you really high confidence trending information, which has been a tradition at the company when the defense budget was rising 5% to 10% a year. But that’s not -- and there was no COVID, by the way, but that’s not the situation now. So, we’re going to start next cycle without trying to give you a trend line in October. We’ll give you a solid formal guidance as we can in Jan of 2024 because of all this. Having said that, even on the products that we fully anticipate are going to get increases because there have been actions inside of government to make it happen, I used the analogy last call of the clutch wasn’t engaged yet even on the order process and paperwork that needs to come to us, so we can actually start production. The way I’d characterize it now is that the clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially, right? So, the process has started. I really give Dr. LaPlante and others a lot of credit, Andrew Hunter in the Air Force, et cetera, the secretaries of the Air Force, Navy and Army departments are all engaged in making this happen. But it does take time to get through, especially on international FMS contracts and commercial sales, too. So for all those reasons, Kristine, it’s really hard for us to estimate what -- at this point in the cycle what programs are really going to benefit. But I’m pretty sure that F-35 and C-130 would be in there. Many of the MFC products, we’ve already talked about. Black Hawk demand internationally especially is ginning up and as well as F-16. So I think there’s a lot of significant areas where the Company can benefit with an additional defense budget increase.
Jay Malave: Yes. And so Kristine, we fully expect, as Jim mentioned, to participate in this industry upside. You’re going to see that in the orders in the backlog. And what we’re talking about here is converting that to sales taking a little bit longer than expected. I think the important thing to remember in terms of 2023 is that in spite of a lower outlook from a sales perspective, even the margin pressure, we’re still delivering the same amount of free cash flow that we told you a year ago. And our free cash flow per share outlook has gotten better because of our share repurchase program.
Operator: Next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jay, Jim. Can you hear me?
Jim Taiclet: Yes, we can. Good morning.
Peter Arment: Great. Congratulations, Greg. Appreciate all your effort. Hey Jay, just maybe you made -- Jim made a comment about the Aeronautics kind of flat to kind of slightly down in ‘23, but then sustainment becomes a bigger piece of the story as we get into ‘24. Should we be thinking about Aeronautics kind of troughing out in 2023? Is that kind of what you’re implying, or are there other puts and takes that we should be thinking about longer term? Thanks.
Jay Malave: No. Yes, I think so. I think next year, they’re dealing with some of the transition related to the changes in delivery profiles on the F-35 -- the production contract. And again, we’re just catching up some inventory because some of the delivery profile has moved around. Once that abates, that headwind, we’re going to see at least a leveling off on the production side, which will lead the growth for sustainment and growth in classified programs and growth on the F-16 program. And so, I would expect them in ‘24 and beyond to have a nice growth trajectory.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. And I’d also add there, Peter, that we’re starting to get some real traction on our sort of JADO offering, so to speak. And one of them has been mentioned briefly today called Defense of Guam. And that’s the really first well -- highly organized DoD major contract to come out that really drives the capability and not just a product or system. And what it’s meant to do is integrate and this is our whole 5G.MIL approach. Actually, that’s why we won it, I think, is that integrating current command and control systems in use by the various services. So, the Army’s -- happens to be provided by Northrop Grumman, for example. We’re going to fully incorporate that into the solution and work with them to do it. And then, we’re going to bring the Aegis system from Lockheed Martin into that mix and a number of other programs and products from a range of OEMs. We’re going to work together on this for the first time in this way. So, I think this is going to be a real pathfinder for the future. And once this demonstrates that it can be a success and the industry has got to coalesce and help make it happen with us, we, as an industry, will see more of these opportunities in the 2024-plus time frame, too.
Operator: Next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: A couple of questions. On the Aeronautics area, Lot 16, you’re not supposed to get in Q4. Jay, does that come with added sales that you may be working on now as well? And then, a second question, if you look at the incremental margin on the profit you provided on the F-35 and the $325 million of sales, it’s like 21%. Does that imply that you increased the margin on the F-35 program? And will that help the margin next year, or is it more than offset by the growth in the sustainment?
Jay Malave: Well, on the second question, George, we did have a profit adjustment on the F-35 program and the production program there. So, we will see moving forward a higher recurring margin rate there. As far as Q4 and Lot 16, yes, we do expect that order in the fourth quarter, as Jim mentioned, a little bit over $8 billion. I wouldn’t -- we do expect a ramp-up in sales at aero, including F-35, and that will include F-16. So to answer your question, yes, that will certainly be part of the sales mix here in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to Rich Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Rich Safran: Jim, Jay, Greg, Maria, good morning. How are you?
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Rich Safran: So Jim, I heard your opening remarks about uncertainties on the supply chain and all that. And Jay, I’m going to put you a little bit on the spot here. And hopefully, I’ll get you to answer a long-term cash flow outlook question. Because I think last year, you gave a long-term cash flow outlook and even added a year. So, you’ve been talking long term this morning and recognizing there’s not a lot of high confidence here. Do you have enough visibility to give us a long-term cash flow update? And if possible, could you cash that in terms of buybacks and free cash flow per share?
Jay Malave: Well, Rich, so if you think about our free cash flow last year, and I’m going off -- a little bit off recall here, we said $6.1 billion in ‘23. I believe it was $6.2 billion in 2024. I don’t see any reason why we can’t deliver that and continue to deliver that level of free cash flow beyond ‘23 and ‘24. So -- and our free cash flow, again, with the share repurchase program will get better than what we were saying a year ago. Again, just our management focus on working capital, our management focus, discipline in delivering free cash flow is not going to stop after one year. And so, I’m pretty confident that we can continue to deliver the free cash flow that we committed to a year ago. And again, our free cash flow per share, our growth, you’re looking probably in the range of mid-single-digit growth over this period of time.
Greg Gardner: Hey John, this is Greg. I think we’ve come up to the top of the hour. So with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Jim.
Jim Taiclet: Sure, Greg. Thanks. I’d like to conclude today by, again, reinforcing what Jay just talked about, our commitment to delivering long-term, attractive and reliable total returns to shareholders, underpinned by our strong cash generation and our robust balance sheet as well as delivering on these 21st century solutions to meet the challenges that our customers are facing in global security right now. And if some of you might have been around when I was at American Tower, we focused completely on free cash flow per share generation. And that got us through 18 years of up and down cycles, the Great Recession and a few other issues that happened along the way. That’s the right metric for this company, too, and that’s why Jay and I are so -- so much emphasizing it today. So, we’re positioning ourselves for anticipated growth inflection in the next few years, investing in innovative technologies for our customers’ missions, as I said, and strong repurchases along the way to amplify the per share value creation as we go. So, thanks again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you on our next earnings call in January. John, that concludes the call. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-19 11:00:00) =====
Operator: And good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, Brad. Good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Taiclet: Thanks Greg. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings call. I will begin today with an update on our F-35 program. Yesterday, we signed a bilateral record of negotiation with the US government, reaching agreement on the Lots 15 through 17 production contract. Through a collaborative effort with the F-35 enterprise, including the Joint Program Office, suppliers, and teammates, we have concurred on the major parameters of the program, addressing inflationary and pandemic-related issues unanticipated at the start of the negotiation process. The agreement supports our long-term objective to produce 156 aircraft a year. However, COVID impacts experienced by the F-35 enterprise have required us to modify our near-term production plan. Deliveries over the next two years are expected to remain in the 147 to 153 range of aircraft, similar to our 2022 plan, before we then achieve our 156 aircraft delivery target in 2025. We continue to anticipate annual deliveries of 156 jets beyond 2025 for the foreseeable future. I'd like to thank the entire team for the dedication and professionalism shown throughout this process and we look forward to delivering these unmatched fifth generation aircrafts for our US Air Force, Navy, and Marines, our partner countries, and our international customers. Moving to our quarterly results. Our business area operational performance was solid, delivering increased profit margins from last year's second quarter. Our new business activity and order flow were also favorable, and we continue to anticipate our backlog ending the year significantly above our 2021 levels, positioning us for longer term growth. Our sales in the quarter were $15.4 billion, lower than we expected due to the delay in contract agreement on the F-35 and supply chain impacts. We anticipate the supply chain challenges to continue for the remainder of the year and we've reduced our 2022 outlook to reflect that as well as some other items, and Jay will cover this in more detail in a few minutes. We also progressed well on our cash deployment plan, delivering over $1.1 billion to stockholders in dividends and repurchases, exceeding 100% of our free cash flow. We will continue to execute on our strategy of driving cash generation, disciplined and dynamic capital deployment, growing free cash flow per share and delivering attractive long-term total returns to you, shareholders. Turning briefly to budgets. Both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees approved their versions of the FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. The SASC recommended approximately a $45 billion increase to the President's request and the full House chamber passed the completed authorization bill with a $37 billion increase. While the budget process remains in its early stages, we are encouraged by the support our programs have seen with the Senate recommending additional F-35 and Black Hawk helicopters, increases over the lower-than-expected volumes that were in the initial presence request. Both the Senate markup and the House bill received strong bipartisan supporting committee with recognition of the need for greater investment to respond to increasing global security threats and the imperative of improving the readiness of our armed forces. Congress will continue the next phase of the authorization and appropriations process over the coming weeks and months. And we look forward to its timely finalization. Turning to our 21st Century Security strategy, I'd like to highlight an important example of how our signature platforms can be integrated into effective joint all-domain operations. These efforts are designed to benefit our soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and guardians by continually upgrading their mission capabilities with the latest physical and digital world technologies. This quarter, our Rotary and Mission Systems and Missiles and Fire Control business areas partnered with the US Indo-Pacific Command in Valiant Shield 2022. This is a biannual training activity focused on integrating forces in multiple domains. Valiant Shield 2022 is a cornerstone of INDOPACOM's integrated deterrent strategy to prevent conflict in the region, and it's the largest US joint force exercise in the Western Pacific. We linked our DIAMONDShield battle management system, AEGIS Weapon System, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or HMARS and PAC-3 missiles to successfully demonstrate integrated multi-domain operations of strategic and tactical mission levels across air, land, sea and space. During this 12-day event, our Lockheed Martin team demonstrated all domain capabilities and collaboratively engaged in experiments with INDOPACOM using artificial intelligence to enable rapid decision making in seconds or minutes compared to ours. Technical demonstrations like these are key enablers to our four-pillar growth strategy. And we will continue to demonstrate to our frontline commanders and servicemen and women in many additional exercise and real-world demonstrations to come. Moving to our four-pillar growth areas and staying with the Pacific region, RMS' Aegis Weapon System was selected to be the backbone system for the Missile Defense Agency's Defense of Guam architecture. This is a pathfinder for joint all-domain operations for the DoD and for regional integrated air and missile defense with an expected program value itself of over $1 billion. This architecture will defend against ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missile threats through the integration of capabilities across multiple industry products and not just Lockheed Martin. Aegis and our TPY-X radar, a derivative of our long-range discrimination radar product, will be the core systems to outpace the potential threat and expand JADO capabilities for Guam. This Guam architecture leverages existing Lockheed Martin capabilities such as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD, PAC-3, Sentinel A4 radar and our C2BMC command and control system, highlighting the advantages of our broad portfolio and cross-business area collaboration with Missiles and Fire Control. RMS will also fully integrate future system capabilities, which may include space-based sensors, directed energy and advanced missiles in the Defense of Guam, a critical cornerstone in Western Pacific deterrence. And we'll be using an open architecture where we can tie-in other prime contractors, products and systems along with ours. Staying with RMS, this quarter, the US Marine Corps approved our Sikorsky teams CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, one of our key programs of record for initial operating capability. The IOC declaration validates the operational readiness of the King Stallion to forward deploy Marines across the globe and positions the Marine Corps for a full rate production decision in 2023. The 53K has a plan of record to deliver 200 domestic aircraft and a total program life cycle value expected to be approximately $50 billion. We're also excited this quarter to receive a $2.3 billion award for Sikorsky's 10th Black Hawk multiyear contract to provide 120 H60 helicopters. This contract includes options, which, if exercised, have the potential to deliver an additional 135 rotorcraft with a value of up to another $4.4 billion. Also this quarter, Missiles and Fire Control received a $1.6 billion contract award to produce THAAD interceptors for both domestic and international customers. Under this combined buy award, the THAAD team will provide both the US government and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with additional interceptors in support of integrated air and missile defense. Our MFC business area was also awarded a contract by the Missile Defense Agency to initiate production of the eighth THAAD battery. The eighth battery expands the US government's ability to field the integrated air and missile defenses and builds upon the previously delivered 7 systems, a clear demonstration of the value delivered by the signature program and defending against current and emerging threats and maintaining the turns. Before I turn the call over to Jay, I'd like to express my appreciation for the presidential visit to the Javelin manufacturing facility in Troy, Alabama, supporting the men and women who produce this remarkable product. The Ukraine conflict has been a dramatic reminder that we're in a global power competition. And we at Lockheed Martin stand ready to support our nation and its allies with advanced systems and technologies. The US alone has committed more than 5,500 Javelin missiles to Ukraine in defense of their country. And this visit spotlighted the continued need for a focus on global security and deterrence capabilities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions.
Jay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail and provide an update to our 2022 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated second quarter financials. Operating results were largely in line with our expectations for the quarter along with non-operating impacts that we previously had highlighted. We generated sales of $15.4 billion. And as Jim noted, our revenues were affected by the delayed contract agreement for production Lots 15 to 17 on the F-35 program and supply chain impacts. Underlying performance was solid with segment operating profit of $1.7 billion and segment margin expansion of 60 basis points year-over-year to 11%.  Earnings per share were $1.16, including $5.16 in nonoperational charges. And we delivered greater than $1 billion in free cash flow, while returning 107% of that amount to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As noted in the press release, we updated our outlook, which I'll review later in my remarks.  Turning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on chart four. Total sales declined 9% due to anticipated program transitions and supply chain impacts across the business areas, in addition to more than $300 million in revenue shortfall from the gap in F-35 funding in advance of our agreement on Lots 15 through 17.  Operating profit declined 4%. And as previously mentioned, segment operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 11%, reflecting another quarter of solid underlying performance, benefits from contract mix, as well as higher net step-ups largely due to the absence of last year's classified program charge in Aeronautics.  Moving to earnings per share on chart five, we've included a reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to an adjusted or operational EPS. First, we've refinanced $2.3 billion of outstanding debt, claiming maturities for the next three years and lowering our near-term exposure to interest rate risk. This impact was $0.10. In addition, we executed our latest pension transfer transaction. And as a reminder, this is our seventh such transaction to reduce long-term risk and volatility of pension trust asset returns. The impact to the quarter was $4.49, including $0.16 of tax timing that will reverse over the balance of the year.  Lastly, volatile capital markets have significantly impacted asset returns and our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund and other plans. Despite the short-term volatility, our Ventures fund has delivered significant financial returns over the long term, but more importantly, has infused Lockheed Martin with emerging technologies to benefit our core business. Adjusted for these nonoperating items, our second quarter earnings per share would have been $6.32 and even higher had the F-35 funding constraint been lifted.  Moving to cash flow on chart six. As you've come to expect, we delivered solid free cash flow in the quarter and accelerated payments of $1 billion to suppliers. Once again, cash deployed to shareholders exceeded free cash flow in the quarter and for the first half of 2022, we have returned 178% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases.  Okay, moving over to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on chart seven. Second quarter revenue decreased approximately $800 million from last year. F-35 sales were down over $900 million due to supply chain impacts, the impact of the Lot 15 through 17 unrecognized sales and sustainment award timing. This was partially offset by strength in our classified area, which increased by more than $200 million this quarter, a 50% increase from the second quarter of 2021. Segment operating margin for Aero increased 180 basis points primarily due to the absence of last year's loss recorded on a large classified program.  Moving to Missiles and Fire Control on page eight. Sales were lower by approximately $200 million, including the expected reduction in sustainment following the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, as well as lower volume in multiple missile programs. Strong performance in tactical and strike missiles and in the missile defense PAC-3 program, as well as favorable program mix drove a 160 basis points increase in segment operating margin. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page nine, lower Black Hawk and presidential helicopter volume, along with supply chain impacts across the business area, lowered year-over-year sales by approximately $200 million. Operating profit was lower based on fewer favorable profit adjustments on Aegis and Radar programs, the impact from lower volume and changes in contract mix. Turning to chart 10 in our Space business area. Overall sales were down $350 million by a $425 -- or driven by a $425 million reduction from the renationalization of the atomic weapons establishment, which is partially offset by solid growth on a next-generation interceptor program. This will be the last quarter we'll be affected by the AWE compare. Operating profit was lower primarily due to the mix and timing of launches at United Launch Alliance as well as lower profit step-ups. Okay. Moving over to our updated outlook on page 11. Our expectations for segment operating profit and free cash flow remain unchanged despite a lower sales outlook, reflecting solid year-to-date results and management's focus on operating performance. Our expectation for full year sales have been by $750 million to approximately $65.25 billion. Three of our four business areas have been reduced due to supply chain impacts, award timing and program schedule shifts, all of which are incorporated into our new guidance. The impact of lower anticipated sales volume is expected to be offset by improved margins for the year, which is supported by our year-to-date margin performance. We are lowering the earnings per share outlook by $5.15 to reflect the impact of one-time items, such as the pension transfer, debt refinancing and year-to-date mark-to-market adjustments. It's important to note that these expectations assume that we definitize the Lot 15 through 17 contract here in the third quarter. In addition, there are no incremental mark-to-market impacts assumed for the second half of the year. Okay. Moving to Chart 12. We provided a detailed view of the changes to earnings per share for the year. The one-time pension settlement charge is now included in our outlook. And following the execution of that pension transfer, the remeasurement of our pension plans has caused us to reduce our FAS/CAS pension adjustment by $50 million. We've also incorporated the impacts of the year-to-date mark-to-market adjustments and our debt refinanced to the new estimate of approximately $21.55. On chart 13, you'll see the changes to guidance by business area. As I mentioned before, three of our four business areas have reduced sales outlooks, reflecting supply chain impact and award timing. But as noted, each business area is holding to the previous guidance for segment operating profit. We're confident that we can deliver higher operating margins, offsetting the top line headwinds with our continued focus on cost reduction, program performance and leveraging the size and scale of the enterprise. Okay. Let's wrap up on chart 14. Our operational performance in the second quarter was solid, with improved segment margins and consistent cash generation and deployment. We revised our 2022 financial outlook, incorporating headwinds, but held our commitments for segment operating profit, free cash flow and cash deployment. Now looking beyond 2022, the Lockheed Martin fundamentals remain strong. We continue to invest in support of our customers' important security missions, leveraging the breadth of our platforms and solutions. Our broad portfolio as well as the current and projected backlog underpin our future growth expectations. In addition, the outlook for domestic and international defense spending has improved and we expect to incorporate these changes over the coming months as we gain clarity on the timing of global security spending commitments and industry fulfillment. To close, our pillars of growth, financial position, focus on strong cash generation, and our disciplined and dynamic capital deployment strategy places us in an enviable position to deliver long-term value to shareholders. With that, Brad, let's open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Yes. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to make sure to have a good understanding of where the F-35 stands here, and you've guided to 147 to 153 per year in the next two years and then 156 in 2025. But the Block 15 to 17 size averages it down at 125 and we assume that starts in mid-2023 in terms of deliveries. So, really two questions here. First, can you reconcile the lower block size with your production plan and also with the 2023 budget levels, which suggests some lower deliveries, at least to us, in 2025? And then second, why did DoD go to these lower block sizes? And does that have any implications for how you think about margins in these blocks?
Jay Malave: Let me walk you through the reconciling item here on your first question, Doug. So, first, when we ended the second quarter, our backlog was 169 aircraft. If you assume, say, the midpoint of 2022 of our guide, let's say, 150 aircraft that says that we would be delivering about another 89 aircraft in the back half of the year. That would take our backlog down to 80 aircraft. With the 375, that puts us at 455. So, if you assume again at the midpoint for 2023 and 2024 of about 100 aircraft -- 150 aircraft, that puts you at 300. That leaves about 155 for 2025. And so maybe one short to the 156 in 2025, but pretty much right there. As far as the lower outlook, a lot of that was incorporated in our negotiation on Lot 15 to 17 in terms of the factors, we've talked about before as far as impacts from COVID, impacts in supply chain, also lower volumes and other factors. And all of that was taken into consideration in the negotiation with the Joint Program Office. The margins themselves at the end of the day, the way the contract is structured as we finalize this is there will be some level of fixed price to it and some level of incentive to it. So, we're incentivized to perform and provide delivery, to provide delivery as well as quality targets to the customer. If we can perform to our expectation in those improvements, then we wouldn't see any type of dilution to our margins today. And we're confident we can perform to those levels.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Jim, Jay, Greg good morning. How are you?
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Richard Safran: Jay, if I could, let me follow up on something you said in your closing remarks here. Actually, I have to think that your international outlook has changed quite a bit in just the past few months. I recognize you're in various stages of negotiations, but could you discuss where you're seeing the most demand come from, for what types of equipment? And importantly, would you be willing to discuss a bit on how this might affect your outlook for 2023? And your answer, maybe you could also just address if you think there could be a trend towards more commercial contracting as a result of what's going on? Thanks.
Jay Malave: Sure, Richard. Yeah, let me get started on that. I think the takeaway here in the closing remarks is that -- as I mentioned, the environment has improved from where it was a year ago. And along with that, our pipeline has certainly grown. And I'll throw maybe a couple of examples to that. We've seen, I think, in the press in terms of higher demand, and we've seen new contracts on the F-35. There's also interest on the F-16 with international partners and customers. And we've talked about we've got a backlog today of 128 aircraft. We're pleased to have Germany coming to the fold -- or I'm sorry, Jordan come into the fold as well. But beyond that we've talked about a pipeline 300 to 400 additional aircraft. That pipeline has grown to about 500 aircraft, given what we've seen over the past six months, six to 12 months. And so in our Aero, in these aircraft, we see incremental opportunities. I'd say similarly in our Missiles and Fire Control, both on the air and missile defense side as well as tactical missile side, we've seen inquiries on foreign military sales. And that pipeline has grown as well, and that's in, say, the multibillion dollars of opportunity. Things like -- things that have been out there in the press, whether it's Javelin, HIMARS as well as PAC-3 opportunities. It's important to remember that in the PAC-3 we are increasing our outlook and our production schedules to begin with. And so the question is how much higher can we take it over the next number of years. As this correlates and I mentioned in my remark that we’ll gain more clarity in terms of how these things will actually manifest themselves into real contracts. The reality is today, none of it is under contract. And so we're trying to get a better understanding what the timing, of which these will come into contract and then getting a better understanding of our supply chain capability to determine when we can actually deliver. But I can say with some level of reasonable confidence is that our orders and backlog outlook over the next two years will be better than it was a year ago. But that will still take some time to convert to revenues beyond that time period.
Jim Taiclet: Yeah. And just to add to that, in response to your question there, Richard, is look, the DoD is in the midst of changing gears and so are our allies, right? So at the beginning of 2022, the administration was still in the midst of a relatively benign global security environment at least relative to now. The US has largely withdrawn from its military operations after two decades of heavy presence in the Middle East. China's increasing activism in the Western Pacific, while recognized was perceived as kind of a potential concern, a watch item for the future, if you will. Europe was totally at peace, and Russian forces remained within their borders at that point in time. But if you fast forward to today, the US and its allies are actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Pacific is on higher alert because of the statements and actions of China recently, not to mention North Korea. The value of deterrence has never been greater really at this point now. And that shift happened over literally three or four months. What that requires is the Department of Defense to shift gears, okay? And I can tell you the clutch isn't engaged yet. And the clutch engaged means there are contracts in place. There's a demand signal out there that's clear. There's funding appropriated by the US Congress in the case of the United States. And we're producing, as Jay said, with a supply chain that's robust enough to support it. To get the clutch to engage is going to take two to three years. And that's for our allies as well because they not only have to go through their own processes internally. They then have to go through generally the foreign military sales process. And for the kinds of systems that Jay outlined, the US government is probably going to continue to insist that we mostly use the FMS process to contract with foreign -- through them to foreign governments for these kinds of equipments like F-35 and F-16 and HIMARS, et cetera. So we actually have a match to our original strategy, which was for the next couple of years, we were expecting relatively flat defense budgets in the US, not a lot of concern out in the allies. That's all changed. But we're aiming for the company and for the share count to be ready for an inflection point now again, in 2024 and beyond, the middle of the decade. This unfortunate situation in global security having deteriorated can only bolster our inflection point from where it would have been. And along with that, we're doing the integration of our signature platforms that everybody seems to want right now into that 21st Century Security fabric, which will make them, we think, even more attractive. And then we'll bring in our counterparts along onto that open architecture going forward. So I do think that it's going to take a while for the clutch to engage here, both in the US and internationally. But the demand in the situation that our customer base is facing has dramatically changed over the last three, four months.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
Jay Malave: Jay, I wanted to ask about the pension. So I saw you mark-to-market with the pension transfer. So $50 million worse this year, but what does that mean for -- based on where things are today, given big time negative asset returns, what are you thinking about for pension in the next couple of years relative to what you guided for prior? I think it was $2.3 billion in pension income in 2023 and $2 billion in 2024. Thanks.
Jay Malave: Yes. Good question, David. This year, excluding the impact of the one-ime charges, we're $2.2 billion for the total FAS/CAS adjustment. I'll break it down. On the FAS side, interestingly, is you're right, David. The assets -- not only did we lose $4.3 billion worth of assets with the pension transfer, but the returns are lower, too. And so that will impact our returns next year. But that is essentially entirely offset by lower amortized losses associated with the pension transfer that we just took. So I would expect our pension, our total adjustment in our FAS is going to be flat. So about 400 – in 400 and change this year to be about 400 and change next year. Similarly, on CAS, we're seeing similar types of effects where next year, the CAS costs will be similar to what it was this year. That is higher than what we are anticipating it to be coming into this year for 2023. So, we'll have to evaluate whether that has any impact on the backlog of our contract, but when you look at it year-over-year, it's essentially flat. Going beyond that, we'll have to kind of update you, I think, in our October call and we give the trending data. But I can say right now for '23, essentially flat.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Thanks so much and good ops. Jay, could you maybe update us? You mentioned supply chain issues, and you mentioned the issue in the F-16, which I guess you kind of preannounced that, that might be an issue, kind of where are you with both supply chain? What are the problems? Where are they and similarly with labor availability? Thank you.
Jay Malave: Yes. Good question, Cai. Going back in the beginning of the year, everyone was impacted by the latest variant that we had. And our operations were impacted, our supply chain operations were impact – and I think our ability to recover from that has been more challenging than we originally anticipated. We have seen some level of improvement in certain areas of not only our operations, but also our supplier operations. But we've also seen broken commitments at the same time. And so, it just caused us to reassess what this meant for the year.  And so, while we do see some improvement, our ability to recover the lost time in the beginning of the year has just become too much of a challenge. And that's really the question when you go beyond '22 now, is how -- does that ripple through? As you see -- Jim mentioned, the COVID impacts on the 135 as an example, we're seeing that ripple through, through multiple years. And so that's something that we just have to continue to evaluate and take a look at what that means to '23 and beyond.  As far as labor, labor has been an ongoing challenge, I think, for the industry as well as us. I think we've -- given the size and the scale of Lockheed Martin, I think that we've been able to weather it reasonably well. And as an example, on F-16, we've been able to take close to 50 employees out of a different operation, an international operation and bring it into Greenville, South Carolina to help us stand up and move quicker on the F-16 program. So, it just goes to the strength and the breadth that we have here at Lockheed Martin.  But nonetheless, it's been a challenge. Our ramp on that program is taking longer than we had originally anticipated largely because of the slower ramp in hiring employees. We're pretty laser-focused on it. We have a dedicated team -- HR team that is focused on hiring people. They are very focused on a particular radius to bring those people in, and I think we're on a good track now with our new schedule. We expect to deliver aircraft next year, and then we'll get to a more strong -- more of a run rate -- full capacity run rate for Greenville in 2024.  So hopefully, that answers all your questions, Cai. But again, it's been – again, supply chain has been choppy for the year. The reason why we took it -- took the expectation down is, we expect it to continue to be choppy for the remainder of the year. And we'll have to reassess it when we give our training data in terms of what it means for 2023 and beyond.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please, go ahead.
Greg Konrad: Good morning.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Greg Konrad: I was hoping maybe just to talk a little bit about Sikorsky and how you're thinking about the outlook there, given you've had some incremental CH-53Ks and finalization of the Multi-Year X for Black Hawk. When does that business return to growth? And then with that, any update on FLRAA and kind of how you're thinking about award timing there?
Jay Malave: So on Sikorsky, we expect to return to growth really starting in 2023 for that business. We're expecting, as you mentioned, the FLRAA decision, which we've been told which should be coming in September. We believe that we are the best choice for that platform, and that is a pillar of our growth. If you may recall, both John Mollard and Jim Taiclet had talked about the four pillars of growth, and one of those being new awards, FLRAA was one of those programs that we have talked about. And so, we expect to see incremental growth in 2023 and beyond. And that is on the back of the CH-53K, which is a program of record as well as new awards, FLRAA being the most significant.
Jim Taiclet: And the timing, we think on FLRAA or at least what the Army has stated is that, there is a decision to be announced in September of 2022. That slipped a month or two from the original plan, but we're expecting and hoping for a good news on that front when the announcement is made.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please, go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. I got three little questions for you, Jay. You previously said that F-35 impact from not signing 15 to 17 would be 500, now 325. So I was curious as to the difference. Second one, the classified, you mentioned, was up $210 million. Was that the same program that you took the charge last year? And the third one was, why is the space margin go down in the second half of the year when you'll have more launches, so ULA profits ought to be higher. Thanks.
Jay Malave: Okay. Good questions, George. Let me maybe go backwards. On the Space margin, you're right. We do have stronger ULA launches in the back half, which will give us lift. Offsetting that is where we're seeing some margin pressure, as we have growth on new programs as well as classified programs, which are coming with pretty low margins, which are pretty dilutive. And so, that's just putting some pressure on the margin in the back half of the year. We'll keep monitoring that, but that's pretty much where we are now. On the $210 million, that was basically the absence of the charge in the classified program last year in Aero. If you recall that the charge itself was $225 million in the second quarter last year. And then on the F-35, the delta, we said that the -- coming into the quarter and throughout my remarks at various conferences, the impact could be as high as $500 million. We were able to obtain some incremental funding, some international funding in the quarter, which helped us reduce that impact to this $325 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Sorry, calling from the airshow, it might be a little choppy. But maybe back to the F-35, the Pentagon a few months ago was suggesting that the contract for Lot 15 to 17 could cover in the order of 400 aircraft versus the 375 that you have a handshake deal on. So, considering the demand from international partners, why is the total volume lower? And then also a follow-up to that is, when you think about the potential for progressional plus up and this international demand, I would assume there's some urgency from some of our partners. Is there upside to that 375? How firm is that figure?
Jay Malave: It's an excellent question, Kristine. I think there could be some variability right now, but still TBD. As we mentioned -- Jim, in the opening remarks, we still need to definitize this particular agreement. We did see in the President's budget, specifically, really the 2023 budget would have had mostly impacting Lot 17 is where you see these lower reductions. They've talked about the funding constraints relative to the nuclear modernization and other items. And so that's something that we just keep monitoring. They did -- as you said, Kristine, in the unfunded priority list, wanted to add back 19 aircraft. Obviously, we're very supportive of that. And that's something that we're certainly pursuing. And we're confident there'll be something there, and it's really TBD over the next few months as Jim noted in his remarks. But there could be some upside, and we just have to let the process play out.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Spingarn: Good morning. Jim and Jay, there's been a lot of talk on growth here. And of course, the near-term numbers have been under pressure. But when you think about the growth components of your four pillars, can you talk about the larger pieces of opportunity there? I was maybe hoping for a bit of review on hypersonics and if you can still hit that $3 billion target? And then some of the other major programs that are going to drive growth, two -- it sounds like a couple of years from now when that -- when the clutch kicks in as you say.
Jim Taiclet: So, Rob, let me start, it's Jim here, on sort of the overall strategic approach that we have and then I'll turn it over to Jay for some of the programmatic details and color. So, look we're focusing on the things we can control versus what we can't control, right? So, what we can't control right now is the level of inflation-adjusted defense budget, which, given 9%-ish inflation, is pretty flat. We can't control the duration of US government and the FMS processes, although we're advocating for those to be speeded up and streamlined. We can't control the timing of legacy programs, so sunsetting, if you will, or at least a reduction in rate volume like Black Hawk, for example. We can't control COVID virus and its effects on the supply chain and our own people. But what we can focus on is our strategic approach of running this company to maximize free cash flow per share in any circumstance, right? So, during this time of, as you pointed out, pressure on topline revenue, we've really used our dynamic capital allocation approach to -- in a slow revenue growth period to still drive by R&D and CapEx because we want to invest for the future growth, but at the same time, ramp up share repurchase and we're going to continue on that path as well. The goal then is to take down the share count in the relatively low growth period. So when the high-growth period comes about, you've got kind of a turbocharger on the investors' basis, if you will. So we think shareholder value inflection point comes mid-decade because the revenue growth we expect to ramp in, we're doing a lot on the efficiency side, something we can control over the next two, three years with our digital transformation and other cost control efforts that we've actually redoubled recently. And so we're going to continue to invest in the business, and so we can make that -- during this period so we can make that inflection point as attractive as possible for you as we expect it to come. So, with that I’ll offer it back to Jay to give you some of those four-pillar details.
Jay Malave: Sure. Rob, our pillars are still intact. You mentioned hypersonics, and we're still pretty confident in our growth outlook there. And I just mentioned that our air-launched rapid response weapon program. We had two recent successful tests, one in May and one recently in July. And so we're very successful there with the capability that we continue to progress forward and where this is going. And so that's all really good news as far as our hypersonics capability and what we're providing and advancing from a technology standpoint. We've talked about our classified programs. We continue to progress there, and we continue to see the growth. I mentioned in my prepared remarks where we saw a significant growth in our Aero classified business this past quarter, and that's just one example of that being on track. We also had the third pillar of programs of record. We've talked about that we've got a ramp that's built into the PAC-3 and the question there is can that go higher and when. CH-53K, Jim mentioned the 200-plus aircraft there, and that's on track. We just as we -- as you know on our charts here, talked about the initial operating capability for the aircraft, and everything is moving forward as well there. We've talked about F-35 sustainment, a 6% CAGR between 2021 and 2026. And so those, again, remain pretty much intact. And then I just mentioned the competitive new wins. FLRAA is a big, big one. We've also got some other large programs, which are doing all the main type programs, Defense of Guam that Jim just spoke about. There's a similar type program in Australia for, called Air 6500, which is an important program for us, important program for the country. We talked about next-gen interceptor being a source of growth in the quarter. And that's something that's also in our new win category as well. And so these things are on track, and we've had this conversation about a growing pipeline. And I gave some color on that before in some of the Q&A. But again, the pipeline is growing. It just becomes a question of when that actually turns into orders and when that turns into revenue conversion.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yes. Good morning Jim and Jay. Jim, you mentioned about the free cash flow per share and being able to see that inflection point. Maybe if you could just comment a little bit on your ability to just grow cash flow generation and grow the cash generation in general, when you're thinking about not only the supply chain headwinds, whether you're carrying more inventory or just in case, just your overall approach there? Do you see an opportunity for Lockheed to really increase the $8 billion plus cash from operations opportunity? Thanks.
Jim Taiclet: So -- and Jay can add to this. We'll look out to the next few years with some, sort of, trending information later in the fall. So I don't want to speak to numbers. But what we can speak to is, again, the reduction in share count. We hope and expect to have ramping revenue down the road, which we should be able to convert into cash flow. So without getting into magnitudes, that's the mechanics of how we are planning for this to play out. But Jay, if you want to add more.
Jay Malave: Yes. We’ve previously provided a multiyear outlook. It was generally flattish, Peter. And that was really due to our increased investment. Remember what we're doing, it's twofold. One on the investment is to get to fly -- the growth flywheel recranked, which is what we're laser-focused on. But as Jim mentioned, we're also investing on our core capability and efficiencies within our four walls. And our digital transformation is a significant investment and is a significant initiative to make sure that we can deliver efficiencies and also make ourselves more competitive. And so that is what's driving, generally, I'll call it, a flattish outlook from a free cash flow perspective. But having said that, going back to Jim's comments as far as efficiency, efficiency doesn't stop at the P&L and on the cost. We're also going to drive efficiency in our asset management, and that should be a source of better cash flow from where we are today. That's something that we have to take a look at. As Jim mentioned, we'll have to look at what that means from a trending perspective over the next few years that we'll provide in October. But the opportunity set is there for us to drive efficiency and even offset where we may have to provide buffer stock from a supply chain perspective and things like that. There's always opportunity to drive efficiency in our operations, and that's what we'll be focused on. And don't forget that we will -- we also in that talked about continuing to deliver around 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchase. We remain committed to that, and there will be more to come as far as specifics in October.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.
Jay Malave: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: So on the F-35 outlook, when we think about the 156 a year around mid-decade and beyond, how do you think about the mix there between domestic and international, given that some of the budget pressures you're talking about like nuclear modernization aren't going away? And then just kind of a couple of cleanup questions. The 375, I just want to be clear about the number there. It would seem that the international portion of that is going to be, on average, 50 or fewer per year, which is down from where it was in the prior economic or finally I just wanted to confirm that. And then also, what's the delivery expectation for 2022?
Jim Taiclet: So Seth, it's Jim. The mix of priority between US and international is set by the Joint Program Office and US government. So we can't really speak to an estimate, future estimate for that. But the fact of the matter is the jets performing extremely well for the US services, the fly, and the commandos will tell you that. Navy is especially impressed because they've done actual fleet tours and exercises in the Western Pacific last year -- over the last six to 12 months and seen it in operation at scale and exercises, which we're really happy with and some of the other services, too. On the international side, you see the interest, including Germany now and others. And I think that's going to continue to increase, both in Asia and in Europe, by the way. So we're confident that the F-35 is here to stay, and we're going to drive through the program. We just can't give you an estimate of US government allocations over the next few years, that's something that they do. Jay, anything else you'd add?
Jay Malave: No, that covers it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Matt Akers: Yes, hey good morning. Thanks for the question. I wonder if you could touch on Missiles and Fire Control margins, and they've been sort of running a little bit higher in the last couple of quarters. I know there was some positive adjustments in there. But if you could just kind of set our expectations of kind of what normal margins look like on that business kind of going forward?
Jay Malave: Yes. Good question, Matt. Very strong performance through the first half of the year in excess of 15%. We do expect it to step back down in the second half of the year. It's primarily due to lower step-ups and some contract mix. And so, we see some just against some of the newer classified programs ramp up. And then we see just the solid performance was really somewhat of an acceleration of good performance into the first half of the year versus the second half. And so that's just going to be a natural decline there.  Having said that, we did -- they are holding their profit in spite of the lower revenue outlook. And so, their margins are going up relative to what we thought coming into the year. So, we'll kind of -- we'll watch them because their performance has been solid, if anything, maybe there's a little bit of upside there. But again, it's just a function of the timing of what we see in terms of visibility to step up changes to profit rate adjustments and in the program contract mix.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. 
Pete Skibitski: Hey good morning, everyone. Jim, I just want to maybe drill down into your thinking about how the US goes about replenishing its stocks. Obviously, in terms of your programs, you think about programs like Javelin but even bigger ticket items like HIMARS and I think maybe GMLRS. I think the US has sent over quite a few of those systems to Ukraine. So, are you guys thinking that basically, it will take until the fiscal year '24 budget is approved for the US to kind of reprogram that replenishment in and get it approved and then the orders start flowing? Is that kind of the right way to think about it?
Jim Taiclet: It's too soon to tell. There are some initiatives ongoing from some of the services in the Department of Defense to put more energy behind replenishment. But that's early in their process. So, we don't have full visibility to it. We're supporting it, of course, and making sure they understand what the capacity capabilities are over the next two, three years to get up to higher volumes. But those actual decisions on timing and budgets will come from the services and the Department of Defense and through the administration. So, we can't really comment on the specifics of that. We do expect it to come, though. It's a matter of timing as I kind of outlined earlier.
Greg Gardner: Well, Brad, we're coming up on the top of the hour. I think everybody who was in the queue has had a chance to ask a question. So with that, I will turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks.
Jim Taiclet: Sure. I just want to first thank all the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their dedication to our mission and their continuing commitment in spite of COVID and other stresses that all of us are facing in our personal and professional lives now. But all those stresses in spite of those, they're providing truly innovative and comprehensive mission solutions for our customers, which is really where I think our whole industry needs to go, as mission solution in addition to great exquisite platforms and effective systems.  So I want to thank you all, investors, again, too, for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking to you again, as Jay said, in October for our next earnings call. So Brad, that concludes the call. Everybody, I hope to have a great rest of the week.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Services. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-19 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Malave, our Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I'll begin today by welcoming Jay Malave to our executive management team. Many of you have worked with Jay during his two-decade-plus career in the aerospace and defense industry and know him to be an exceptional financial professional and an outstanding leader. We're excited to have Jay join our company. On a personal level, I'm extremely pleased to be working with him. I'd also like to recognize John Mollard, he's with us today for his tremendous contributions as our acting CFO. We're grateful to John for his leadership and financial acumen, and he's continued as a key member of our team, leading our treasury organization. Moving to our financials. Jay will discuss our first quarter results and 2022 outlook in detail in a few moments, but I'll begin with a brief overview. Our first quarter sales were slightly below our expectations. However, our full year 2022 outlook remains intact. We did experience some adverse impacts from the winter surge and the Omicron variant in our operations and our supply chain, but we expect these to reflect short-term timing issues. I'm proud of how our team responded to these challenges, and we remain committed to delivering all the objectives that we laid out in our January outlook. Our operational performance was solid, with our business areas delivering increased profit margins from last year's first quarter and free cash flow was ahead of our projections. We also progressed well on our cash deployment plan, executing a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement during the quarter. We are well on our way to achieving our full year outlook of $4 billion in repurchases as we look to deliver over 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders over the course of the year inclusive of dividends. We will continue to execute on our long-term strategy of disciplined and dynamic capital deployment, growing free cash flow per share and thereby delivering strong long-term returns to shift to shareholders. Turning to the F-35 program. Germany recently announced their intent to procure 35 aircraft. Lockheed Martin will support our U.S. government Joint Program Office in this process, as we look to partner with Germany to provide this unique capacity and capability for its national defense. The government of Canada has also announced it will enter into the finalization phase of their procurement process with the United States government and Lockheed Martin to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets for the Royal Canadian Air Force. Canada is one of the original eight partner countries on the F-35 program, and we're very pleased to have the opportunity to provide this unrivaled plane to strengthen Canada's national defense. The German and Canadian announcements followed similar award decisions last year from Switzerland and Finland. And these four competitive wins have the potential to add 223 F-35s to our backlog when all are finalized. All four of these recent announcements underscore that the F-35 fighter jet remains the most capable, survivable and highly connected platform in production as well as the best value available today for our war fighters. And although the initial quantity of F-35 is requested in the FY23 President's budget submission was below our expectations for lot 17 aircraft, we expect that the services adds via the unfunded priority list and increased international demand will enable us to deliver on the stabilized production profile we had previously established. With respect to the overall Department of Defense budgets, this quarter, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 Omnibus Appropriations Act, with strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, and the bill was subsequently signed into law by President Biden. This legislation improved approximately $742 billion in DoD spending, an increase of nearly $40 billion over the FY21 enacted amount. The final bill resulted in increases that will benefit multiple Lockheed Martin programs over the next few years, including fully funding 85 F-35s, 21 additional C-130J transport aircraft, 10 additional Black Hawks, 2 additional CH-53K helicopters as well as increases to some of our franchise satellite and missile programs. This quarter, the President also submitted the fiscal year 2023 Defense Department budget request, the first step in the FY23 budget process. The President’s submission added an additional $30 billion to the enacted FY22 appropriations and totaled $773 billion in requested DoD funding. This initial budget submission continues the administration's emphasis on the Indo-Pacific region, it supports Ukraine and focuses on strengthening our nation’s deterrence capabilities, all initiatives that are well aligned with our portfolio and with our 21st Century security The DoD also expanded investments in important technology development efforts such as Future Vertical Lift and hypersonics. Also key elements in our multi-pillar growth strategy, and we look forward to providing our customers with innovative solutions for these and other important missions. On a related note, I'd like to take a few moments to bring you up to date on two of the four pillars in our long-term growth strategy, our programs of record and new business opportunities. As to programs of record, this quarter, our Sikorsky team received over $1 billion in orders for the CH-53K platform, one of the main contributors in our program of record growth pillar. These announcements included awards for 13 low-rate initial production lot 6 aircraft, including 4 for Israel as well as long lead time items for full rate production lot 7 helicopters. The program is performing very well and as it continues to inflection to full production, we anticipate tripling our deliveries in the next few years. We also continue to see significant opportunities across the competitive new business landscape. Beginning with our space business area, we are very excited to be awarded transport layer tranche 1, one of three prototype agreements from the Space Development Agency. The $700 million award to design and build 42 small low-earth orbit satellites as part of the initial tranche of the National Defense Space Architecture. This transport layer constellation will connect assets in space with platforms and other domains in a highly capable mesh network environment for joint all-domain operations. And it's an outstanding example of 5G.MIL enabled JADO technology, maturing into a program of record. This award built on our current Tranche 0 contract that will deliver 10 space vehicles later this year, and we look forward to continuing our support to the SDA and the development of our country's next-generation space architecture. Continuing with competitive new business activity, in March, our Sikorsky team delivered our final updated prime proposal to the U.S. Army in response to their future long-range assault aircraft solicitation. Several weeks ago, we flew our DEFIANT aircraft 700 nautical miles from West Palm Beach to Nashville to be displayed at the Annual Army Aviation Association of America Conference. That was completing a 7-hour mission that further demonstrated the capabilities and the maturity of this remarkable rotorcraft. We believe our DEFIANT offering is the most mission-capable platform available, one that will provide our soldiers with transformational capabilities and unparalleled maneuverability, and we're excited to offer this unique solution in support of our armed forces. Before I hand the call over to Jay, I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere sympathy for those affected by the Russian government's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The conflict has resulted in devastating impact to the Ukrainian people and heightened security threats for the European continent. While we hope that this conflict is resolved peacefully soon, Lockheed Martin is taking steps to help address the resultant humanitarian crisis through multiple partners. These include committing aid to the Polish Red Cross, Project HOPE, USO and others to provide assistance to refugees, and we will continue to support ongoing relief efforts in Eastern Europe. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions.
Jay Malave: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the introduction, and it's an honor to be part of the Lockheed Martin team and represent our 114,000 employees on the first quarter earnings call. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail and discuss our 2022 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated first quarter results. As reported in our earnings release, results were largely in line with our expectations as the first quarter was impacted by program life cycle transitions. In addition to the expected program effects, we also saw some impacts to sales timing, mostly due to the spike in COVID early in Q1. Total segment operating profit was $1.7 billion, and segment operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 11.1%. Earnings per share were $6.44, and we delivered $1.1 billion of free cash flow. We also got off to a strong start to this year's capital allocation program, with $2 billion of shares repurchased in the quarter at an average price of approximately $427 per share. Along with almost $800 million in dividends paid, we returned greater than 2 times our free cash flow to stockholders. And we remain committed to our full year outlook. Turning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on chart 4. Total sales declined by 8%, mostly reflecting anticipated program reductions, with about 1.5 points coming from supply chain and internal operations delays, primarily associated with the recent COVID surge. Our operations and supply chain teams did a strong job of managing this latest challenge, and we expect these timing impacts to be recovered over the course of 2022. Segment operating profit declined 5% versus last year, and our segment operating margins expanded 30 basis points to 11.1%, reflecting solid underlying performance in spite of lower net profit adjustments versus last year. Turning to segment sales on chart 5. Three of our four business areas affected by expected program life cycle timing. Space declined by approximately $450 million due to the nationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment program. Rotary and Mission Systems sales were also lower, driven by approximately $300 million from the delivery of an Australian pilot training program in last year's first quarter as well as other mission system program transitions and COVID-related timing impacts. And Missiles and Fire Control was lower due to supply chain delays in integrated air and missile defense, reduced sustainment revenue for special ops following the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, and program transitions in the tactical and strike missile business. Aeronautics was flat this quarter as expected, with increased F-16 production offsetting lower volume on F-35. Moving to segment operating profit on chart 6. Operating margins were higher at space and MFC with the increase in space driven by additional ULA equity earnings, and MFC expansion from solid program performance and successful contract negotiations on an international program. Both aero and RMS margins contracted, primarily due to lower net profit adjustment, but they met or exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Overall, solid performance across the operations. Turning to earnings per share on chart 7. Our first quarter EPS of $6.44 declined by 2% and reflected the impact of decreased sales volume, mark-to-market adjustments and lower FAS/CAS income, partially offset by benefits from the increased segment operating margin, reduced share count and a lower tax rate. Shifting to first quarter cash generation and deployment on chart 8. Free cash flow of $1.1 billion was ahead of our expectations, following the very strong $3.7 billion of free cash flow generated during the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash deployment continued to drive value for our stockholders as we returned $2 billion through share repurchases, leaving approximately $2 billion on our existing authorization and outlook for 2022. Combined with nearly $800 million in dividends paid, we returned over 240% of free cash flow to shareholders this quarter. Operational cash remains solid as the business looks to grow quarter-over-quarter through the rest of 2022. Okay. Moving over to our 2022 outlook on chart 9. We remain confident in our full year outlook as we have seen improvements since the Omicron variant spike. Our first quarter sales were approximately $250 million below our expectations, which equates to less than a single day of volume, and we expect this to be fully recouped throughout 2022. For the balance of the year, we project sales of slightly below $16 billion in the second quarter, around $17 billion in the third quarter and $18 billion in the fourth quarter. As our release stated, our outlook does not include any impacts from potential debt refinance or pension liability transfer actions that are currently under evaluation. On chart 10, and we break out our segment sales and operating profit outlook. Our segment estimates for 2022 remain consistent with the guidance we provided in January, and we continue to anticipate long-term growth for all four of our business areas. It's important to note that our consolidated and aero outlooks are dependent upon reaching agreement on F-35 lots 15 through 17 here in the second quarter, as funding constraints would likely cause a timing impact to our financial results beginning this quarter. Our teams are diligently working with their Joint Program Office counterparts to achieve closure on this critical milestone and both parties are striving to finish negotiations in the near term. So, we remain confident in our full year projections. Okay. To bring it all together on chart 11. The first quarter delivered solid operational performance that was largely in line with our expectations in spite of the effects of the recent COVID spikes. Our cash generation and deployment also got off to a good start with a focus on strategic investment for growth and fulfilling our capital allocation outlook for the year. Our solid performance and our four-pillar growth strategy have us well positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value. So with that, John, let's open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we go to line of Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Spingarn: Well, good morning, Jim and Jay. It's good to see you again.
Jay Malave: Thank you, Rob. It's great to have you covering the Company and the industry again. Welcome back.
Rob Spingarn: Thank you. Jim, I wanted to ask you if we could discuss Eastern Europe a little bit more. And I know it's early, but perhaps we can expand on your earlier comments and discuss in more detail the potential impact for Lockheed. So, to start, I'm thinking of incremental demand for longer-range weapons that the U.S. is now talking about for Ukraine, but also the F-35, the F-16 and other products at MFC, both domestically and for allied nations. So, in terms of specifics, what products are most relevant? And at a higher level, how do we think about this influencing organic top line growth over time, say, the next five years, rest of the decade?
Jim Taiclet: Sure, Rob. Let me just start by articulating the foundations of what we think we're facing as a company and a country and an alliance, given the circumstances. The world's clearly changed with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A major global power has crossed a recognized international border to take territory by force. And as a result, the value of strong deterrents to war as an instrument of nation's geopolitical strategy has not been as great since the middle of the 20th century. So, here at Lockheed Martin, we're aggressively and have been aggressively positioning our company as a deterrence company. Using the F-35 and our other core platforms as pathfinders, we're developing an open architecture using 21st Century digital technologies to continually enhance the deterrent effect of our national and our Allied Defense enterprise. And we have an integrated strategy to do so. I mean, I'll talk about a couple of platforms in a minute. But it's really about the integrated strategy and its ability to enhance deterrents as we go forward, every -- not 6 to 10 years with a new platform, but while we're doing the new platforms every 6 to 12 months in parallel. So, across Lockheed Martin, we're integrating our own business areas to be able to deliver on this idea and this vision. We're also integrating our strategy as a company across the U.S. and toward its allies, so they can work together more closely and effectively over time and ultimately, across the defense and aerospace industry and commercial technology industry as well, so we can accelerate those 21st Century digital technologies that others are investing a lot of time and talent in to, like 5G, AI, distributed cloud computing, et cetera. So, it's more about the strategy and what we can deliver in total as a company and maybe as a pathfinder for our industry. So, some of the platforms you mentioned fit really well into this strategy. The F-35, for example, you led off with. My interactions with pilots and commanders and senior government officials in countries, including the U.S. and Israel, and in Europe, where the F-35 has been used in either combat or combat support operations. The feedback is the aircraft is unmatched as an aircraft, especially with its fifth-generation stealth capability and be survivable in a really hostile environment. But equally exciting to the people I’ve been getting feedback from on the front, so to speak, is the ability of the F-35 to be a core sensor and a core command node and control node in a much wider network of national defense or deterrence. And so, the sensing capability of the F-35, combined with its aspects and kind of a 5G.MIL perspective as it's got -- and we'll have even bigger but it's got the largest data storage capacity of any fighter aircraft. It's got the greatest store data processing capacity on board of any fighter aircraft that we know of. And it's also got the best connectivity and sensor suite back to the command and control network into other platforms. And that really is the essence of what we mean by 5G.MIL. So, as you see, the F-35 has already become a more important platform, I guess, I'd say post Ukraine, unfortunately. And that is with Germany, seemingly moving from one direction to another toward the F-35 for its nuclear mission, responsibilities in Europe. Also, with Canada selection, of course, they’re part of NORAD as well and the integration, both in Europe and there and even in Asia, will be enhanced with F-35, and we expect that -- again, the services are asking for more airplanes beyond the President's request as well. So, the F-35 has been called by Chief Brown as the quarterback of the U.S. Air Force future strategy because of all those capabilities I talked about. So, that's part and parcel and really kind of the lead pinnacle, so to speak, of our strategy, and it actually fits in really, really well with integrated deterrents, which is the same concept that Secretary Austin has been developing with his team. You mentioned F-16. It's a great affordable 4.5 generation airplane when you take the Block 60 and 70 avionics and you marry them up with a proven -- an aircraft like the F-16. It's an earlier and more affordable way to get our allies on board with us so that we can integrate them into our 5G.MIL system. And then, the other effectors that you talked about, long-range precision strike weapons and long-range defensive weapons like THAAD and PAC-3 are going to be probably in greater demand as we move through time. So, all those are the trends that strategy that I outlined is meant to really ensure that we can defend against what's going on in the environment of the country in alliance. But it's the future out-year revenue growth for Lockheed Martin, it's too early to say, and we're not yet in a position to attempt to quantify that. But we'll update you as we proceed forward, Rob, every quarter as to what our expectations are in the current period. But we'll also update you on where we see these trends going. But I think this is the right set of platforms and the right strategy to enhance and preserve Lockheed Martin's leadership in the defense and aerospace industry.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: So, can we talk about the F-35 some more, maybe what's going on with negotiations, what exactly is the hold up? And then, when we think about the fiscal '23 request of 61, how does that relate to production? And how do we think about international orders being feathered in when we think about 156 units produced overall?
Jim Taiclet: Sheila, it's Jim. I'll start off and maybe turn it over to Jay for some more of the detail. But we're very confident in our ability to reach an agreement with the Joint Program Office in the U.S. government on our negotiations that are ongoing. But what's really important to us and for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders, is that we have a clear and shared understanding of the changes in the cost environment of the aircraft that have occurred over the last 12 months or so during this negotiation. And two of the biggest cost drivers in the upward direction are inflation and COVID effects that have actually been ongoing over the past couple of years. And so, we need and feel it's very, very important to take all those costs into consideration, make sure that there's a joint agreement on what those costs are and the magnitude of those, so that we can have a successful program for everyone in lot 15 to 17. There's also, as we touched on earlier, some lower quantities that were initially projected for that lot. We're working with the U.S. government and also the -- our international partners to see if there's ways to bolster that number. But right now, what we're working with is a lower number in negotiations. So, when you add all those things together, it's incumbent upon us to make sure we get an appropriate transaction or agreement for our shareholders and for the U.S. government and for our workforce as well. So, that's what the -- I wouldn't call it a holdup. I would just say that's the reality of the situation, and we're working closely and constructively with our government customers to collect on to that cost baseline and then we'll work from there on the contract.
Jay Malave: Jim, let me just add on a little bit. As far as the negotiation, Sheila, we're encouraged by the progress being made. There has been progress, and we're encouraged by that. As far as an acute impact, it could be $500 million plus in the quarter, which we'd expect to be timing that we would recover in the balance of the year, assuming a successful negotiation. There does remain a gap, and Jim alluded to that. The team has been working with a sense of urgency to really complete this negotiation. And again, as Jim mentioned, it's important to keep in mind that we need to reach the right agreement for our stakeholders, even if that means we have to endure some impacts in the short term. As far as the production question. I mean, we're pretty confident in the 156 three-year plan that we had laid out before from a delivery profile. As you mentioned, the international customers and these customers that Jim just mentioned in his prepared remarks, provide some level of flexibility to really shore up that production schedule. You may have seen in the unfunded priority list for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines, there was about 19 aircraft added to that. So, when you mix that in with the international demand, we feel very comfortable in our ability to maintain a 156 production cycle over that three-year period.
Operator: Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: In the investment community, it seems like there's this assumption. I'm just going to lay this out here and that Textron is going to win Future Vertical Lift. And I'm curious from your point of view, why you don't think that is the case? And I mean, if you could walk through for all of us on the call, the pluses and minuses of a layout like defiance got over valor? I mean you've got counter-rotating helicopters, what do you get with that that you don't get for the tilt rotor and vice versa?
Jim Taiclet: Ron, it's Jim. I'm an ex Air Force Aviator, maybe I can start off and Jay can add to it if he’d like. I've experienced this pretty close hand, and I've been involved in special ops helicopters, not as a pilot, but as a partner in my prior life a long time ago. What's most important to people that have to fly helicopters into hot landing zones is maneuverability and an ability to get into close quarters, let's say, into a landing zone surrounded by trees onto a rooftop in a crowded urban environment, things like that. And I would -- because I've seen the aircraft fly, I've flown the Matrix myself, which is our tech demonstrator in S-92, up in Stratford. That is the war fighter advantage, the maneuverability of the dual rotor X technology is head and shoulders above anything you could ever do with a tilt rotor. And the second question then would be, well, what about the speed -- max speed and sort of horizontal flight, if you will, cruise. We've got our aircraft up to over 230 knots, I believe, at this point. There's probably some upside to that. And that is not the differentiator. Getting the aircraft, the 100 miles that you need to go from base to target, 2 minutes faster is irrelevant versus when you get to the target, are you going to survive and live through that mission? And that's the differential. I think if it's war fighters and commanders making this decision, the only one they can make is future vertical out of Sikorsky and Boeing. Jay, anything else to add?
Jay Malave: No, I think that was well said. I think that's it.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Rich Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Rich Safran: So, I recognize you don't want to get out in front of the government on this, but I thought you might comment on what the FY23 request says about growth this year and next year and your prior expectations for $8.1 billion in cash from ops for '23. I just have to believe that the request as it stands, was above the assumptions you used when you gave out your 2023 estimate. So, if they requested -- if we take a standpoint that if the request is enacted just as is. Does that alter how you're thinking about 2023 growth and your cash from ops guide?
Jay Malave: Let me take that question first. The budget was beneficial. I think as Jim mentioned, the trends are favorable, directionally, it's moving in the right way. And again, you would expect it to be incremental from the low single-digit baseline that we had previously provided. And maybe a little bit of color you've seen in a lot of reference to integrated deterrents emphasis on all domain and interoperability. And there's quite a few things from a programmatic standpoint to be excited about things like nuclear command control and communications reentry -- future reentry vehicle systems, our TACAMO recapitalizations, Next-Gen Interceptor, Next-Gen OPIR and others. And so, directionally, as I mentioned, it feels pretty good. As Jim had mentioned, we're still compiling this, and we're going through the analysis. It's going to take us some time to work through exactly what that means from an impact. I think it's fair to say that it's beneficial. It's biased to the upside, the extent to which they'll really have to work through and at the appropriate time, we'll let you know what that is.
Operator: Our next question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: Maybe following up on Rob's earlier question, I understand that it's too early to provide long-term outlook with regards to Ukraine. But, can you give more color in terms of the nearest term opportunities for you? I mean, Germany has announced a $100 billion modernization of its armed forces. And as our allies step up spending for defense, how meaningful is this opportunity for you? And in addition to F-35, should there be opportunities that we should watch for in missile and missile defense?
Jim Taiclet: So Kristine, this is Jim. And obviously, we're in a long-cycle business here from an authorization in the House Armed Services Committee, for example, to book of revenue -- booking of revenue at Lockheed Martin could be 12 months to 3 years, depending on the program. So, I think -- as I tried to lay out, the environment is more challenging from a security -- national security and global security perspective than it was before. That suggests that deterrence is a more valuable product than it's ever been, at least in the last 80 to 100 years, and that we feel we're really positioned well with our strategy to meet that need for national security and global security. But we can't quantify yet exactly how that's going to touch our revenue on a $66 billion base, for example. And until we get actual contracts that have order schedules and we get the funding to do the long lead time items and all of those nuances and specifics in defense contracting. So, we're not going to try to bracket what those growth numbers are going to be, because we want to keep the fidelity of our guidance process. And we give it a year at a time. I did that in my last company, too, because that's where we have real data upon which we can give you a reliable forecast.
Jay Malave: Yes. I'll just add, Kristine, that there are conversations ongoing with our government customer, to Jim's point, and sensitivity analysis, scenario planning and things like that. And as those firm up, we'll provide clearer information to you.
Operator: Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: So, if we could return to the F-35 contract negotiation. So, your major subcontractor took a $93 million hit because of delays related to COVID, you mentioned that COVID is an issue. I understand that LHX is still kind of working through the software, and you've been at this with the government for, what, three quarters trying to negotiate this. So, I guess, the question is, I assume you will reach an agreement. But basically, will this result in a profit hit? And secondly, if you don't reach an agreement in the second quarter, what's the incremental impact likely to be?
Jay Malave: Kai, so at this point, we would not expect any type of profit hit based on our negotiation as it currently stands. And again, it's a dynamic discussion, but we wouldn't expect any type of charge there. Going forward, as I mentioned here, the impact would be up $500 million plus in the second quarter. To further extent, obviously, that will go up. I think that we'll probably have to revisit later in the quarter to see how things are progressing. And I think we can update accordingly then. I think let's just kind of get through the quarter. We're encouraged and really pleased with the progress we're making to date. I know it's been a long road, but there's been some significant progress that's been made. And so, we're encouraged that we can be able to close this in a relatively short period of time. If not, then we'll update you accordingly at that point in time.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. And remember, during the negotiation period, we've had significant changes in the underlying cost factors of bidding for the next three lots. And again, those -- it was concurrent. So, yes, we've been going at this for a number of quarters, but that's because that cost baseline has been moving during that time, and we both have to agree on where we think it's going to end up. And so, COVID impacts was cited and inflation, which is even a more recent phenomenon, so to speak. We've got to go all the way back to our supply chain, see what the impacts are going to be, then present that to the government. They have to vet those estimates and those cost assumptions. And that's what the basis of the negotiation to follow. So, this has been longer than normal because the underlying ground has been shifting on the most important assumptions that go into the negotiation. We are going to stay with our strategy, which is constructive, which they are, and progressing negotiations on the basis of actual cost information and data that provides our shareholders a fair margin and return as well as a government attractive contract.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: I wanted to ask a little bit about capital deployment. And I think you mentioned kind of similar to prior guidance, but you talk about the buyback plan or capital deployment overall being dynamic. And so, the share price has changed. I think, Jay, you mentioned some potential items having to do with the pension or debt repayment. So, maybe you could talk about how you're thinking about things differently and how the dynamic aspect of that has changed versus three months ago, if at all?
Jim Taiclet: I can start with the theory and turn it over to Jay for the practice. The theory I have on capital deployment is what’s some highest and best use every quarter of the dollars that are created by the company or that we could or should be borrowing from the capital markets. And the batting order for me here kind of continues from my prior experience, which is based on regression data on when we make decisions, how they turn out. And what's the best ROIC that we can expect for a given dollar of investment or a given $100 million of investment? It tends to have been in my experience in both, this and other companies that capital investments based on actual or anticipated contracts with real customers, tend to have the highest ROICs. And we've bolstered our CapEx budget and plans under John's leadership and now Jay's as well at Lockheed Martin because we've got good prospects for contracts we're winning that are going into production that we need to invest in. The other thing we've done and really stepped up our internal spending on and we expect to get good returns from is our digital transformation program which I would say really is in the major leads right now, frankly. We've got a great CIO running it. She's got a fantastic team. We have a well-thought-out plan. We have support from our Board to go do this on a multiyear basis. And it's going to make us more efficient, more competitive and higher quality products coming out of our plants. So those are -- that's the first area. Our highest ROIC tends to be in universe, so to speak. Second area I found to be most beneficial is inorganic investments, right? So, we're looking at really hard now, making investments in both, the U.S. and other countries in technologies and programs we think are going to have duration and traction. And again, some of those will be in the U.S. and some will be outside the U.S. I think you'll see us investing a little more by putting, say, let's call it, boots on -- and brick-and-mortar on the ground and other countries than we have in the past because we expect those ROIs to be pretty compelling. When it comes down to what's left, M&A tends to be the third in the batting order. That doesn't seem to be really wide open in our industry right now with the current administration. So, we're going to then look to what else can we do and it's share repurchases, the next thing in the batting order. And you've seen us step up to that as far as announcements and performance already this year. And if we've got excess capital, and we are at a reasonable leverage level, we'll go ahead and continue to buy back shares. And I'll let Jay talk about intrinsic value and how we weave that in. But we're going to put our capital to work, the cash flow we generate and what we can borrow and maybe even lever up if those opportunities with high ROICs get bigger than we thought.
Jay Malave: Let me just add -- let me just clarify, Seth, in terms of the debt. We don't plan on delevering. It would be just refinancing what we have. And so, the existing capacity we have really doesn't change at all. The use of the cash wouldn't change either. It's just taking multi -- potentially multiple years and refinancing that in various tranches here and doing it efficiently. As far as the prioritization of our capital, I agree wholeheartedly with what Jim just laid out. And so, we're going to go through that evaluation process. Keep in mind, I've been with the Company about 2.5 months now. And so, I would just ask for a little bit of time for us to just go through this process deliberately and analytically so that we can make the best decisions. If you look at the industry, we've seen an uptick in valuations in the industry as a whole. But I would say, our stock still remains undervalued on a relative basis. And from an intrinsic value, we're just -- we're going through that whole analysis right now. Based on some of the questions you asked, really taking another look at our growth outlook in determining what that comes up from a value for the company. So, we're going to go through that. We're going to be deliberate about it and then make the best decisions from a capital deployment. The key here is that we've got plenty of flexibility and plenty of opportunity, and we won't be afraid to use it. Ultimately, what we want to do is get to sustainable growth in free cash flow per share, and that's what our objective is.
Operator: Next, we'll go to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: So, I wanted to follow up on this, thinking about the growth outlook beyond '22. So, I think previously, you had said 2% revenue growth in '23, a little bit of acceleration beyond and that was based on $715 billion fiscal '22 budget with $245 billion in modernization that we got $740 billion and $265 billion. It sounds like F-35 you think can kind of hold in there with the plan that was in place when you talked about 2% growth. So I mean, can you quantify at all how much potential acceleration we could be looking at above and beyond that 2%? And is there anything that got worse from a program standpoint as you think about that beyond fiscal -- beyond 2022 outlook?
Jay Malave: Thanks for the question, David. Let me just maybe put it in a little bit of context, and remind you, in Jim's comments, we are a long-cycle business. So, benefits that you may see in a particular budget year manifest themselves and get delivered from a revenue standpoint over multiple years. And the best example I can give you is the -- 2022 plus-ups. If you look at the plus-ups and the impacts to us, that was about a little bit over 2 points of growth in any given year. But the reality is the profile -- delivery profile of that revenue stream is going to be over 3 to 4 years. And so, it's going be spread over. And so, as we just had an opportunity to have this presidential budget dropped, we're in the first inning here. We need to see -- let the process play out and get a better understanding in terms of what these program increments mean to us and in what periods. And so, we're just going to need some time to really go through that. And as I mentioned before, we'll obviously keep you updated at the appropriate time, but it's just a little early to really make those calls right now.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Hey. Jim, you coming into this year, you always have a kind of a long list of international pursuits in terms of potential international awards. Maybe you could just remind us some of the bigger ones that Lockheed is focused on and maybe any of the timing around that, that would be appreciated? Thanks.
Jim Taiclet: Sure. Well, we've got, as you've seen, a lot of success on the F-35. We also have international F-16 interest that's increasing. CH-53K is on the table in, say, Germany, for example. So, there's an across-the-board interest in these products, THAAD and PAC-3. Middle East has got to defend itself against missiles being fired at oil and gas infrastructure and even worse for populated major cities. And so, those kind of products have high demand in that part of the world and others as well.
Jay Malave: Peter, I'll just add -- I mean, F-35 Lot 15 to 16, orders we expect, those are -- actually, they will have some international volumes associated with those big numbers this year, and those will really move the dial. We've got Black Hawk Multi-Year X, which is a multibillion-dollar award as well. And we didn't really talk about it here in the first quarter results, but we had about a $4 billion award in our classified. And if you recall, it's one of our pillars of growth here in the first quarter. So, very excited about that program as well. And so, we're positioned pretty well for award growth for the balance of the year and heading into next year.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Matt Akers: There's a line in your release that I think is new with the outlook on potential pension risk transfer and refinancing transactions you may do as early as Q2. I was wondering if you could talk about what some of those are? And what kind of impact those might have on your results this year?
Jim Taiclet: Sure, Matt. The first one is just the transfer of pension, what you've seen us do over the last few years. This is essentially matching assets and liabilities and having insurance, transferring these over to insurance companies from a liability management perspective. And so, we're contemplating doing another round of those. On the debt, it's just a matter of taking multiple years of debt and really refinancing that out just a little bit earlier than waiting for the maturities to occur in each particular year. And so, those may have some P&L impacts associated with them. Last year, we had a pretty sizable impact on the pension liability transfer I don't have that in front of me. We're still working through that right now. But just to say that those may happen here as early as in the second quarter, just to give you the heads up about that.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Jim, you touched on this, but getting back to fiscal '23 and congressional support for defense budgets. When the administration came out with its request for '23, it admitted it hadn't really taken Ukraine into account because of timing. And obviously, we saw the congressional support in '22. So, I'm wondering if you have a sense of how additive to the budget to the request that Congress may be in '23? Because it seems like there's more broader support than there was even a couple of years ago.
Jim Taiclet: Sure, Pete. Look, I'd like just to go back to the environment we're in. I think it's pretty evident leadership in Congress and the key committees, of course, are well aware of this environment. And they have points of view on what the defense budget ought to look like to meet that environment, and then, the specifics underneath that. So, for me to get ahead of them at this point is really not our place. But if you look in historical terms, recent or beyond, Congress does have a point of view in these matters and tends to take their own actions because they are the authorizers and appropriators at the end of the day, and they'll have a voice. But I can't predict what that outcome is going to be in a quantitative fashion yet.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: If I'm correct on the profit adjustments, not related to volume, if you correct for those EACs, the underlying booking rate was about 8.4%. I think that's the highest I've ever seen for you guys in quarter. So, two questions. One, did you adjust or lift the underlying booking rates systematically, or is this more just a reflection of favorable mix happening in the quarter?
Jay Malave: I'd say, it's a combination of both, Myles. You're pretty close to that underlying recurring margin percentage. If you think about it, last year was a pretty good size year as far as net profit positive adjustments. And as you would expect, those carry forward into higher run rate margins moving forward as you recognize revenue. And so, part of it is also mixes plays in the game as well. But I would expect what you saw in the first quarter to generally be what we'll see for the balance of the year. And so, we expect our profit adjustments to be lower year-over-year. Last year, we did about 28% of our profit. This year, in the first quarter, we did about 24%. For the full year, we're expecting that to be closer to 25%. And so -- but again, it's -- we're very comfortable with our margin outlook. We're very comfortable with our EPS outlook, and we're just seeing a little bit of a transition here with recurring versus margins versus the profit adjustments.
Operator: And next, we'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Jay, if you look at your guide for the second quarter of $16 billion in revenues, it's down $1 billion, if you adjusted the first quarter for the $300 million nonrecurring benefit you had at MST, it was also down $1 billion. So, why won't the second quarter be a little better in terms of relative to last year, particularly when it seems like Omicron is somewhat going away?
Jay Malave: That's a good question, George. Look, the second quarter would have us down around 7% year-over-year, and so we'd be down around that ballpark for the first half of the year. We're still -- while it's still a dynamic environment, I guess, is the best way to describe it. And we're still dealing -- even though we've seen significant improvement since the beginning of the year is still we're not out of the woods. And so, we're holding it there. We would still expect to have some level of impact that will clear itself up in the back half of the year. And that's really the placeholder for that second quarter number. We still are dealing with through the first half of the year, the impact of the Atomic Weapons Establishment program from the UK. And so, it's just -- year-over-year compares are tough. It is sequentially a pretty big step-up. You're talking $1 billion nearly, around that ballpark. And we think that's the right place to be for the moment. And of course, if anything changes, we'll update you accordingly.
Operator: And we'll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: This might be a question for Jim. There's been a lot of discussion about whether defense in an ESG construct now looks different. I was wondering what your perspective might be on this and whether you've seen any shareholders or new shareholders are coming on to the register as things have been changing?
Jim Taiclet: Sure, Rob. I mean, my personal view of this having been an aviator in military myself is that you can't really have an effective economy and protect human rights if authoritarian governments are not constrained in what they might do and how they might do it, frankly. So, I would put that national security and human security notion up equally with other ESG topics like corporate governance and global warming, climate change, which are also very important. But I'd put it in the same category. I recognize in Europe that before Ukraine occurred that that was not necessarily the trend. But, we've seen some increased interest from our international investors around the world because I think people are starting to recognize that this is not an anti-ESG industry. You could call it neutral or positive perhaps. But we're trying to maintain the conditions where people can live safe, happy, lives and the economy can flourish, especially a free market economy.
Operator: And we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Last year, you did more than $2 billion in Missiles and Fire Control in the Middle East. And certainly, the Middle East was a critical area over the course of the Trump administration in THAAD, PAC-3. But now we haven't seen as much activity. How do you see the trajectory going forward in terms of Missiles and Fire Control in the Middle East from here?
Jim Taiclet: I'm not sure a regional approach is the right way to look at it. We've got demand signals for THAAD and PAC-3 from around the world because, again, countries everywhere are recognizing that, especially when you see missiles hitting hospitals and situations like that and train stations in Ukraine, that it's worthwhile to have an effective missile defense capacity in your country. So, we are getting signals that, if anything, we might have to increase capacity in certain products to meet the global demand. So, I'm not sure the regional approach is the best way to look at it. And by the way, that threat hasn't gone down either, it's getting greater instead of lesser, based on what Iran tends to do in that part of the world.
Doug Harned: Yes. And that's kind of where I was going. Because it does seem like in Europe and Asia, there should be some real -- some strong interest there. So just trying to understand the puts and takes because as you build out -- as you complete a lot of systems in the Middle East, should we expect these other parts of the world to essentially pick up some of that, fill in any gaps there and potentially even add to growth for THAAD, PAC-3 and maybe just assure?
Jim Taiclet: Without the data to quantify it, Doug, you kind of -- I'm a little bit data-driven first. I don't want to speculate on that. But directionally, it sounds something that could come about, frankly. We would expect it in a way, but to quantify it a little too soon.
Jay Malave: Yes. I'll just add, Doug, we are planning on a multiyear up cycle on PAC-3, where this year we'll deliver around 450 units, and that's spiking up to 550. And so, it's well positioned and contemplates some of the things that you've talked about already.
Greg Gardner: John, this is Greg. I think we've come up at the top of the hour. So, I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.
Jim Taiclet: Sure. I'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire Lockheed Martin team, all 114,000 people strong for their contributions and dedication, especially over the last many months, where COVID reemerged in the winter, and we still had production to get done, and they did it. Our workforce has performed with the resilience under a lot of challenging circumstances for a long time. And through their ongoing efforts and commitment, our company is now positioned to deliver outstanding technology and solutions for our customers and long-term value to our shareholders. So, I want to thank you all again for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July.
Greg Gardner: Thanks, John. That concludes our call for today.
Operator: You're very welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-25 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded.

Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. And I hope you’ve had a good start to the New Year. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call as we review our results, key business area accomplishments and our outlook for 2022. I’ll begin with an update regarding our proposed acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings. As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we thought it highly likely that the FTC would sue to block the transaction. Since that time, we have received notification from the FTC that they have, in fact, authorized filing a lawsuit. We will review the lawsuit and evaluate all of our options. With the filing of the suit, we may elect to defend the lawsuit or terminate the merger agreement. Moving on to our financial results. In a few minutes, John will discuss our financials in detail and provide our outlook for 2022. But I first would like to begin with a few highlights from the quarter and the year. In October, after we concluded our financial planning process, we established an updated forecast for 2021, which we achieved or exceeded. We met our $67 billion sales forecast, and our segment operating profit and earnings per share both exceeded our projections. Our cash from operations was exceptionally strong, over $9.2 billion, supporting our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. During the year, we made significant investments in our signature platforms and systems as well as emerging technologies, all to meet the rapidly evolving challenges, as we see every day in the news now, the challenges that our customers are facing and to support future growth for the benefit of our shareholders. Moreover, we continue reshaping and modernizing our operations to increase efficiencies and reduce costs so we can deliver affordable solutions for our customers going forward as well. During 2021, we spent $1.5 billion on independent research and development, a new high watermark for the Company. Notable areas of our IR&D efforts included hypersonics, directed energy and artificial intelligence. We also initiated the development of mission-based technology roadmaps and advanced our 5G.MIL architecture to truly enable joint all-domain operations across multiple platforms, U.S. military services and allies. These investments position the Company to meet our customers’ most critical needs well into the future. During the year, we also spent $1.5 billion on capital expenditures, focused on addressing customers’ program requirements and supporting our organic growth outlook. Significant capital projects included the introduction of three new state-of-the-art factories of the future, additional adoption of cutting-edge software and hardware solutions to enable model-based engineering throughout the Company, and the establishment of production facilities to support our key hypersonics program. During the fourth quarter, we brought many of these elements together for the opening of an intelligent advanced hypersonic strike production facility in Courtland, Alabama, supporting both our Missiles and Fire Control and Space hypersonic programs. This facility integrates critical digital transformation advancements such as robotic thermal protection capabilities into our manufacturing operations and represents our long-term investment in this critical technology. The Courtland facility joins our new spacecraft Test Assembly and Resource Center in Titusville, Florida and our recently opened 215,000 square-foot advanced manufacturing facility in our Skunk Works organization in Palmdale, California. Together, these facilities add to our intelligent factory framework, digitally linking sites and assets across the enterprise to speed production, provide cost efficiencies and drive future margin improvements throughout the Company. From a capital return perspective, during the quarter, we executed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program and thereby retired nearly 6 million shares under that agreement. This brought our total 2021 repurchase amount to over $4 billion, which when coupled with our strong dividend payments resulted in a total of $7 billion of cash returned to our shareholders during the year. We will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases and expect to utilize our remaining $4 billion authorization in 2022. I’ll now touch briefly on the Department of Defense budgets. This quarter, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act with strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. The NDAA policy bill was subsequently signed into law by President Biden. This legislation authorizes a $25 billion increase for the Department of Defense for a total of approximately $740 billion for defense programs and raised the investment accounts approximately 8% above the President’s originally requested amounts. Currently, the DoD is operating under a continuing resolution through February 18th for FY 2022. As Congress continues the appropriations process, we believe our programs are well supported, reflecting the fact that our portfolio is aligned with affordably delivering our customers’ national security capabilities. Now -- turning now to our growth strategy. Last quarter, we discussed our long-term expectations, which anticipate that our sales will increase by approximately 2% in 2023 with steadily increasing sales growth through 2026. As we discussed in October, the four primary areas that underpin this longer-term growth forecast are programs of record, classified activities, hypersonics and new business awards. Expansion in our program of records is a clear key pillar of our long-term growth strategy. In this quarter, we are pleased to see two new customers select our signature programs to support their national security objectives. Last month, the government of Finland selected the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as the winning entry in their HX Fighter Program competition, citing the aircraft’s affordability as well as its combat, reconnaissance and survival capabilities is best suited to deliver on the HX requirements. This announcement for 64 conventional takeoff and landing stealth fighters has a potential contract value of over $9 billion and follows Switzerland’s decision to purchase 36 F-35s. These announcements highlight the momentum that is building in this program with future international opportunities in Canada and elsewhere to go in front of us. Our Rotary and Mission Systems team also secured an important international opportunity this past quarter as the Israeli Air Force signed a letter of acceptance with the United States government to pursue the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter. This agreement enables the Israeli Air Force to procure 12 53Ks with the option to buy another half dozen. If fully exercised, those options could exceed $2 billion in value. Israel then be our first international CH-53K customer as they look to replace their current fleet of legacy Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters, which have been flying over 50 years. Another pillar of our long-term growth strategy, our classified activities, also saw momentum build in the fourth quarter. Our Space business area was awarded a contract by the U.S. Air Force to develop and classify -- fly a prototype RF payloads in space. Our solution leverages ongoing internal investments on our LM 400 satellite bus, providing greater mission flexibility and longer-duration orbit life. This award for initial engineering contract includes options to deliver an operational system with the potential for this to grow into a new franchise program down the road. And on a final note, 2021 presented a challenging environment for both commercial and defense industries, especially in terms of continuing COVID-19 effects and supply chain impacts. Our teams in all 4 Lockheed Martin business areas and across our corporate functions banded together and did a tremendous job maintaining our production operations and advancing science and engineering on behalf of our customers. I’m extremely proud of the perseverance and dedication of our entire organization, and I know that as One Lockheed Martin, we’re going to drive future growth into our business and advance our vision to accelerate 21st Century Digital World Technologies into our national defense enterprise. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to John and join you later to answer your questions.
John Mollard: All right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we’ve included with our earnings release today. Let’s begin with chart 3 and an overview of 2021 results. Starting with sales, we recorded revenue of $67 billion, which was consistent with the guidance we provided in October. This record level of sales was made possible by an exceptionally strong fourth quarter of delivering affordable, relevant solutions to our customers. Additionally, our segment operating profit of $7.4 billion and earnings per share of $22.76 exceeded our October projections, driven by strong operational performance across the entire portfolio. We generated more than $9.2 billion in operating cash flow this year. And as we discussed last quarter, we are committed to a strategy of disciplined and dynamic capital allocation. We continue reshaping our operations and identifying ways we can increase efficiencies and reduce costs. As Jim mentioned, we invested $3 billion in research and development and capital expenditures to help our customers achieve their missions and to drive organic growth. In addition to this internal reinvestment, we repurchased over $4 billion of shares in 2021, including $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Combined with increased annual dividend payments of approximately $3 billion, we returned just over $7 billion to shareholders. Looking forward, our outlook for 2022 remains consistent with our October trending information as we build our foundation for growth in 2023 and beyond. Turning to chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year’s results. Sales and segment operating profit both increased 3% compared to 2020 results and represent high watermarks for the Company. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the year. Our full year earnings per share of $22.76 incorporates the $4.72 noncash charge associated with the $4.9 billion pension liability transfer that we completed during the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, our pre-transaction EPS of $27.48 was 12% higher than our 2020 results due to increased volume and improved segment operating margin, gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio, increased FAS/CAS pension income, and a reduction in share count. On chart 6, we look at our full year cash generation and deployment. 2021 cash performance was outstanding as we generated over $9.2 billion in operating cash flow and $7.7 billion in free cash flow. We returned 91% of this free cash flow to our shareholders through increased share repurchases and dividends. Our remaining share repurchase authority is approximately $4 billion, and we expect to opportunistically deploy that entire amount in 2022. Moving on to chart 7 and our 2022 guidance. Consistent with our October trading information, we estimate 2022 sales at approximately $66 billion and segment operating profit of approximately $7.2 billion, resulting in a segment operating margin of 10.9%. FAS/CAS pension income is projected at $2.26 billion, which is $60 million higher than the $2.2 billion estimate we provided in October. We are projecting earnings per share of $26.70, and our estimate for 2022 cash from operations remains at greater than or equal to $8.4 billion, excluding the impacts of the R&D capitalization tax law change, which we now estimate at approximately $500 million. I should mention, there is still a possibility that legislation will be enacted that defers or refuels the requirement to capitalize R&D expenditures from a tax payment perspective, but we are including the impact of higher tax payments in our current outlook as we will be required to make these payments unless existing law is amended by legislation. On chart 8, we show our updated three-year forecast for cash generation. Our outstanding fourth quarter cash flow was driven by a tightly coordinated collections process across all business areas and functional support organizations, leading to exceptional collection results from both domestic and international customers. Partially offsetting this upside was an increase of $700 million in accelerated payments we made to our supply chain during the fourth quarter. With the emergence of the Omicron variant and surges in COVID cases, we increased total accelerated payments to over $2.2 billion at year-end and our continuing effort to mitigate supply chain risk. Our outstanding collection performance and the increase in accelerated payments to our supply chain partners resulted in our generating $9.2 billion in cash from operations and $7.7 billion in free cash flow. Over the three-year period from 2021 through 2023 and before considering the potential impacts of R&D capitalization, we now project total cash from operations of greater than or equal to $26.1 billion, which is $900 million higher than our prior estimate. This increase was driven by our fourth quarter results and our expectation that we will maintain this extremely high level of performance throughout the forecast period. Generating over $25 billion in operating cash flow after incorporating the potential $900 million impact of R&D capitalization provides significant support for our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation strategy. On chart 9, we break out our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business areas. Our estimates for the year remain consistent with the trending information we provided in October as we focus on long-term growth opportunities and building on the strong operational results we delivered in the fourth quarter. And on chart 10 to summarize, we successfully closed out 2021 with all metrics equal to or better than the guidance we provided in October, highlighted by exceptional cash generation. With our strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate high levels of operating cash flow, we are well-positioned to execute on our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation strategy for years to come. I’m excited about our opportunities in 2022 as we deliver mission capabilities for our customers and long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, John, we’re ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go to the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Jim, so I figured I’d try to ask about the news of the day on the Aerojet deal. You mentioned defend or terminate on the kind of the pending transaction. Can you give us really any color on the time line that you at least plan to evaluate the lawsuit? And if you do choose to terminate, would you expect to kind of redeploy those proceeds towards capital deployment, or are you preferring kind of pursuing your M&A strategy?
Jim Taiclet: So, Peter, our merger agreement with Aerojet Rocketdyne allows for a 30-day period post filing of a lawsuit to make that decision of either defend or terminate the agreement. So, we’ll be working with our Board over the next few days and weeks to make that determination.
John Mollard: And cash deployment?
Jim Taiclet: Well, of course, I mean, it’s a great opportunity actually with your question, Peter, to speak to what John and I have been talking about here, disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. So basically, we array and assess all the alternative uses of capital and through a lens of what’s the most beneficial for the shareholder, what’s the best long-term ROI for that dollar of cash flow. And we look at the array of IR&D CapEx that I just talked about. Last year, it was about $3 billion in total. We made those investments because we think for organic or new business growth, they’re going to have great ROIs and they’re going to get the first call on our investment. But we don’t have an unlimited set of opportunities, so to speak, in either R&D or CapEx. So, it’s bounded. So then we look at inorganic growth opportunities, which could be M&A, joint ventures, et cetera. Those that are available are not necessarily expansive right now, let’s say. And so, then that leads you then to share repurchase and dividend growth, which is where the bulk of our funds are going these days, as you’ve heard from John. So, it’s dynamic and disciplined. That’s what we mean by it is we’re going to look across all those opportunity sets, look for the best ROI for the shareholder down the road, and then we’re going to allocate that capital there. And we don’t need to grow our cash balance. We have upside, I’d say, on leverage, should we choose to take it down the road. So, you’re going to see us continue to allocate capital in that way. So, we’re not just going to sit back and say, well, whether AJRD goes through or not, we’re just going to sort of sit back on our capital and let it grow in the cash count. We’re going to keep allocating it dynamically to the most and best how it’s used.
Operator: Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: I wanted to ask within the guidance for this year what you’re assuming with regard to the CR. And then, Jim, you mentioned the plus up on the authorization side. If we ultimately see that come through in terms of appropriations, what might that do to your prior guidance for 2% 2023 growth? And I guess, the last one, just, John, if you can comment on what changed on the R&D capitalization side, taking it down from $2 billion impact to $500 million? Thanks.
Jim Taiclet: Sure. So, I’ll start off, it’s Jim here, and then turn it over to John. So it really was encouraging what Congress came out with in the NDAA. From a program perspective, it was excellent for the Company, 9 additional Black Hawks, 2 additional CH-53K in the NDAA, 4 additional C-130Js and 12 more that interceptors. And beyond that, there was increased funding for some of our tactical and strike missile programs as well. So really solid literally across the Company impact of the NDAA. We’re assuming that the continuing resolution does get resolved at some point by September 31, 2022. And the impact of that NDAA, and hopefully the defense budget appropriation coming along with it, will be really to build the pipeline of future revenue for us. It’s -- given there’s only sort of 7 or 8 months in the fiscal year left in the first place, we have most of our revenue visibility already in process of production orders and deliveries. So John, I’ll give it back to you. But basically, it’s -- those plus ups are longer-term value creators for us and the shareholder, not necessarily going to hit meaningfully in the next, say, six to seven months.
John Mollard: Yes. And just to put a point on the CR impact, it would take pretty much a full year CR to have any sort of impact on our revenue that you would see. The biggest impact will be to our customers’ ability to prosecute their missions, especially in program areas where requirements would have us on a trajectory to grow. And obviously, with the CR, you’re not able to grow program requirements. So absent a full year CR, I would anticipate relatively de minimis impact on the forecast we’ve given. And I think your -- next question was around the change in the R&D tax payment assumption. I think last -- historically, we’ve talked about a number of $2 billion. I think last quarter, it was probably a little more subtle than you would have thought. We’ve kind of changed the definition to say, "Hey, we could see up to $2 billion." I’ll start by saying there’s still a possibility that legislation is going to get enacted that will end up in this getting deferred or repealed, and I said that in the script. But given the number one vehicle to have that done is the President build back better legislation and given where that is, the path to enactment remains unclear right now. But we do, however, believe there’s recognition by Congress that legislation is needed to address this critical aspect of R&D activities. It’s really not at all consistent with our nation’s public policy objectives. Now, specific to the change in the amount from up to $2 billion to the approximately $500 million we’ve got in our guidance. One of the first reviews I had with our tax team after taking on my current role is to understand the assumptions that were used in calculating that projected impact. I have a bunch of questions about these assumptions, and as 2022 grew closer without any form of legislative action, we refined our analysis and then shared that with external advisors. And what we did -- we concluded that the capitalization provision scope was narrow than what we had originally assumed. We’ve historically claimed the R&D tax credit on certain activities. And after discussion with our advisors, we determined that the R&D tax credit framework is relevant in establishing the scope of R&D activity that will require capitalization. So, as a result, we’ve updated our estimated impact to reflect the value that is consistent with the provisions of the tax code.
Operator: Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan.
Seth Seifman: John, I was just looking at the outlook for Aeronautics this year and kind of the 10.5% margin rate, which if we add back the second quarter charge to 2021, margin was well above that and above that in each of the quarters. So, can you talk about the mechanics of what’s driving down profitability in Aeronautics this year and then how you see that trending going forward beyond ‘22?
John Mollard: Yes, absolutely. Good question. Probably the two biggest, I’ll call them, dilutive impacts on margins in ‘22 is the growth in our classified activity in Skunk Works. These are predominantly very good ROI programs, but their margins that they attract that given the lower financial risk associated with these programs are going to be dilutive. So, we’re projecting growth in the Skunk Works operation of roughly $300 million that’s coming in. That’s going to be dilutive. And then, we’ve got a lot of growth in our F-16 program, and given where that program is, I mean we’re roughly a year out from first deliveries on the F-16 line with the ramp that we’re expecting. We’re projecting revenue to increase on F-16 roughly $300 million. Given where that program is in its life cycle, we think it’s prudent to reflect typically prudent but relatively conservative margins on that growth. And as a result, you’re going to see a reduction in margins in 2022 on the F-16 program. Those are probably the two biggest dilutive margin growth areas within Aeronautics. I think longer term, the key to growing margins in Aeronautics is going to be performing on the delivery of the F-35 production program. And that’s going to require us to perform on delivering the enhanced capabilities that our customers need that we’ve talked about a lot in keeping, for example, the TR3 infrastructure upgrade program on track, keeping the mission capability expansions on track. I’m fully confident we will be able to achieve our internal operating metrics. And if we do, there will be upside.
Operator: Our next question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.
Kristine Liwag: It seems like there’s more urgency from the Pentagon in hypersonics. Can you provide an update on where your various hypersonic programs are progressing? And should we see an acceleration from your $3 billion outlook by 2025?
Jim Taiclet: Yes. Good morning, Kristine. I’ve just returned a couple of weeks ago from opening up that Courtland facility in Alabama. And two of our, I guess, marquee programs and those that are perhaps among the furthest along, in fact, three programs are going to be produced there. And I’ll just mention them really briefly. It’s a complicated set of systems. But a couple to keep in mind are what the Navy calls Conventional Prompt Strike or CPS. That’s a hypersonic missile of some size that has very good range and will be launched from submarines and ultimately from destroyer-type shifts. In concert with the development of that strike product, the Army has teamed up with the Navy, which is somewhat innovative and novel for them, for what they call the Long-Range Hypersonics Weapon program, so LRHW. The Army intends to use a very similar missile but launch from ground units through what’s called a TEL. TEL stands for Transporter Erector Launcher. We’ve already delivered the first training unit of that TEL to the Army. So, they’re working with that today. The missiles will be produced in the Courtland factory over the next few years. And we’ll be serving the Navy and the Army from there. The third product that we intend to produce in the Courtland facility is for the Air Force, and that’s called ARRW or A-R-R-W, so Advanced Rapid Response Weapon. That’s an air-launched missile that travels with hypersonic speeds, and we’re testing those at Edwards Air Force base now on B-52 bombers as the carriers there. So we’re going through test events in that program with the Air Force. And over the next couple of years, we hope to be making the production runs on those as well. So, that’s the summary. Again, there’s more to the story, but I think those are the highlights, CPS, the advanced air-launched weapon and then the long-range hypersonics for the Army.
John Mollard: And Kristine, this is John. To your question on the long-range guide, I think I’ll stick with the $3 billion sort of revenue forecast in 2026. There are opportunities to grow it. As Jim mentioned, there’s operational urgencies driving our customers to push us to go faster and faster. There’s emerging activity in counter hypersonics that -- maybe of some note that we’ll keep an eye on that could provide upside to that forecast. But I think for modeling purposes, I’m comfortable with $3 billion.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to Rich Safran with Seaport Global Securities.
Rich Safran: If it’s okay, I have two. I think they’re very quick questions. So, on the supply chain issues last quarter and the accelerated $2.2 billion in payments you accelerated to suppliers that were going to be made in ‘22. If I look at 4Q results, I’m just wondering if supply chain issues that hit you in three quarter -- third quarter are now behind you. I’m just curious if the risk has been meaningfully reduced. You expected them to impact you on ‘22 and wondering if the outlook has improved and what that means about your guide. Second question, if you have to abandon the Aerojet deal, just wondering if that has any impact on your hypersonics strategy.
John Mollard: Yes. Rich, I’ll take the first one, and I’ll let Jim take the second one. Just in general, as you pointed out, we accelerated substantially more payments to our supply chain during the fourth quarter than we even talked about back in October when at the time, we had $1.5 billion accelerated, and we said that we would anticipate maintaining that level through the year-end. But given the global COVID situation and the ongoing fragility in our supply chain, we decided that increasing the level of accelerated payments to our partners was a prudent risk mitigation strategy. And to your point about, are you hitting your marks, I’ll give a lot of credit to our global supply chain leadership team. They’ve been actively working with all of our suppliers to ensure we’re collectively positioned to meet our customer requirements, and that includes like embedding our own Lockheed Martin personnel within their facilities to help with the stresses that they’re facing. And as a result, I think a proactive activity by our supply chain leadership team, I was encouraged to see that our fourth quarter supply chain activity was in line with the expectations we set in October, which assumes some level of recovery from October -- from what we saw in the third quarter. But there is still no doubt an overhang on the ability of our supply chain really to pivot to normal changes and requirements. So, I don’t think we’re all the way out of the woods, but I think we’re focused -- we’ve got laser-like focused from both a management involvement point of view and financial support.
Jim Taiclet: And Rich, I’d just summarize all that by saying we think the bow wave has passed in supply chain disruption for Lockheed Martin, but we’re still watching it closely. And as John just said, not all the risk is out of the system yet.
John Mollard: On the hypersonic strategy, I’m just going to take AJRD out of the discussion, but I will tell you this. So for us and our customer base, which is basically the three largest military services in the United States, we’ve all agreed jointly to kind of a go-fast approach to development, which means there’s a little more risk in the development sequence, if you will, develop and test, learn the lessons and then redesign. So, we’re doing that jointly. And one of the benefits of integrating somewhat vertically with propulsion and what’s called the glide body, which is the heat-absorbing part of the missile, and then the full air system that supports the missile either out of the tube or off the airplane. The more you can integrate that engineering organization, probably the faster you could go, but we can manage it as we do today with the propulsion provider outside of Lockheed Martin. So, we’ll continue to manage it as we have. We think we could have gotten the speed and efficiency increase by partial vertical integration hypersonics through the AJRD acquisition specifically. But we can still manage it whichever way that deal turns out.
Operator: And we’ll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Jim, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the F-35 sustainment situation. There obviously continued to be press noise about this, and whether you’ve made any progress on bringing that cost per hour down? Thank you.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. I think we made great progress over the past year by really bringing attention and integration between the joint program office, these key services that fly the airplane and Lockheed Martin and actually Pratt & Whitney also is the suppliers. So, we’ve all joined together in a way that I think might even be unprecedented in that we all realize we have a shared goal to reduce the cost per flight hour and improve the readiness rate of the jet. And we’re all working together to do that. So, we’ve had some successes where we’ve got long lead time spare part orders already through the system, and that will help with having enough spare parts in the right places at the right time to reduce costs and improve the readiness rate. We’ve also received a request for proposal for somewhat more limited, but nonetheless, a PBL or performance-based logistics program that we, again, together agreed, let’s really focus on the supply chain side of that, which you can integrate with production parts planning and sustainment parts planning. You always want to -- if you can keep those together. That’s where this PBL is largely focused, less so on sort of the labor piece of it, which we’ll figure out as we go with the government, what happens in our supply chain, what happens at Lockheed Martin, what happens in depots. But the bulk of the value will be in the parts flow, distribution, production integration, et cetera. That is, I think, a three-year PBL. We hope to get that negotiated over the next coming months or quarters, if you will. So, I think, we’re really well on the road to having a much more coherent and integrated industry customer program office approach to sustainment. And we’ve already got good progress in getting some of the cost per hour down even as we speak.
John Mollard: Yes. Just to kind of put a quantitative mention on what Jim was talking about. So, at the end of the year of 2021, we had 753 fielded aircraft. And based on the production plan, that number of fielded aircraft is going to grow from 753 to like 1,525 aircraft, which is a 15% compound annual growth rate, and the number of fielded aircraft and the flight hour growth rate even faster. So, you can think of sustainable cost as a function of flight hours. The flight hours are growing over 16%. And I think we gave you a long-term sustainment revenue chart in our October call, and you would have seen on there a 6% growth in our compound annual growth rate and our sustainment costs over the period. So to me, personally, that says a lot to the amount of aggressive cost takeout that’s being embedded by all the actions Jim talked about.
Jim Taiclet: And we did move it up with the joint program office to a five-year PBL response. So, that’s where we’re standing today.
Operator: Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: I wanted to go -- just continue on the F-35. Right now, when we think of production rates, at one time, we were looking at a peak level of about 220 per year. That’s steadily come down to the 156 peak level that we’re looking at now, and we’ve seen some U.S. rate plans come down as well in budgeting. But at the same time, you’ve seen some new international opportunities, Finland being one of them. What risks do you see to the 156 level as a plateau level? And how do you expect the mix to progress between U.S. and international over time?
John Mollard: Yes. So, I’ll take a shot at that one, Doug. I mean just the broad pattern is the U.S. program of record is over 2,400 aircraft. I can’t remember if it’s 2,430 or 2,450 or whatever. But then, we anticipate another, call it, 900 international aircraft. So, the total program by program of record is in excess of 3,300 aircraft. So, when we look at that and we look at the production flow and we think about when will we get -- Finland is probably the most current contract or approach or campaign that we think we’ll get under contract most quickly and then Switzerland, and you’ve got opportunities in Canada as well as a number of other campaigns. In looking at the data, the 156 aircraft production rate, I would think, if anything, has bias to the upside. I mean, the reason for picking the 156 is the last thing you want is a sawtooth production pattern where you’re ramping up and ramping down. So between us and the joint program office, we set a rate that we’re fairly comfortable will result in a level-loaded production build tempo for the foreseeable future.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. And Doug, it’s Jim. Just as I think everyone on this call understands, you have to invest in the capital base for your peak of the sawtooth production schedule. And then you’ve got overcapacity in those years where the sawtooth trends down, and then you might have to recover and invest even more to bring it back up. So between the services and JPO and us, I was literally in on this conversation myself because I understand the needs of the Air Force and Marines and Navy as well as the production system that steady and reliable 156 a year was the right investment level for government and for Lockheed Martin and our supply base over time. So, I agree with John that the bias could be to the upside, especially if we win more of the international opportunities. But, I don’t see a lot of downside risk to it. And the last thing I’ll touch on, because you’ve actually taken a deep dive into this, Doug, and I appreciate you taking time to do that in the past. We’re getting more interest in our sort of technology acceleration concepts to bring digital world technologies into the defense enterprise. And in the aerospace domain, the F-35 is not only the logical, it’s the essential cornerstone of actually doing that. Because the aircraft, especially with the Tech Release 3 and the Block 4 capabilities that John mentioned are coming, will have, by far, the highest data storage level, the highest data processing capability; and with our 5G.MIL approach, the most comprehensive connectivities of the cloud, both dedicated and commercial, to really make it even more attractive. So I do see if there’s a bias to anything to be on the upside as this other element of the F-35 becomes increasingly important, its capability to be an edge node and an integrated system.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. It looks like one of the biggest benefits to the cash flow this quarter was like a $2 billion decline in contract assets. So, if you could discuss that. And obviously, it doesn’t seem like it’s a onetime benefit because the strong cash flow this year didn’t affect your ‘22 and ‘23 guidance. So, if you comment on that. And then, one other, in RMS, you’ve got declining sales and a declining margin projected for this year. Is that mostly due to Sikorsky where government helicopters come down and development programs like the 53 grow? Thanks.
John Mollard: Yes. Thanks, George. I’ll take both of those questions. And as it -- as usual, your analysis is right on. I’ll start with the last question in and around RMS. Yes, we’re projecting almost a $300 million revenue decline in Black Hawk, the multiyear 9. Obviously, that’s a hot production line, which would tend to have accretive margins. So we’ve got a decline there. We’ve also got an over $300 million ramp in the CH-53K program, as you indicated. And that -- given where we are in that program with a long run runway ahead of it, we -- again, per our typical practice, look at risk retirement events in front of us, make our best engineering estimates of when those events will be achieved. And then, when we achieve them, we record what we would describe the step-ups that you’ll read about. But the two biggest margin factors are exactly what you talked about, decline in the hot production line and a ramp in the CH-53K. So, for the three-year guide, yes, the contract assets you just saw were specifically what you and I would call accounts receivable back in the day. Just to give you some perspective, in the last 3 weeks of 2021, we collected $6 billion in the last 3 weeks. I mean there were 2 weeks where we were over $2 billion. I’ll tell you, when we talked about our operating cash flow guidance in October, there were several very large domestic and international collection events that we’re absolutely not tracking to collect in 2021. I kind of talked about this in the script. We came together as a cross-functional team and made a number of changes in both our internal approach and in our customer outreach activity. And those changes resulted in us collecting not only all those high-risk invoices, but we were also able to bring in a lot of collections that I absolutely would have thought, no way those collections are going to be collected in 2021, and they were. So to your point about, hey, this must not have come out of ‘22 because you’re maintaining your guidance. I’ll say, so while accelerating the collections from 2022 into 2021 drove the outperformance in the fourth quarter and in 2021, I’m really confident that the process and the focus that we applied in the fourth quarter is repeatable, like every year, ‘22, ‘23, ‘24. And as a result, I’m comfortable that we can still generate the prior guide for ‘22 and ‘23, despite the outperformance.
Operator: Next, we go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Jim, what’s your take on the adaptive cycle engines as applied to the F-35? If you look at what GE is saying, they suggest that it could give the aircraft maybe 30% more range. And if indeed that’s the case, does that open up the market for the airplane?
Jim Taiclet: So Ron, I actually had the opportunity to visit both engine plants in the last couple of months, Middletown for Pratt & Whitney and Evendale for GE. To their credit, both companies are investing great talent and resources in improving engine options for the F-35. So, there’s one road that the government customers can take, which is improving the existing basic engine design. And there’s a second road they could take, which is a clean sheet engine design that you identify it correctly. It’s called adaptive cycle engine, right? So, I’ve been around this earlier in my career, so I find it interesting. But the difference between the adaptive cycle engine and the upgraded existing engine technology is that rather than two streams of airflow going through the engine, it’s divided into three streams with some fairly sophisticated veins and control mechanisms and feedback throughout the engine. Both potential engine vendors are developing that second technology that I’m talking about, the adaptive cycle or three-airflow-type engine. And it’s really just now up to the Joint Program Office and the Services and Department of Defense writ large to work with us and figure out, well, will the improved engine technology be a viable option for the future based on the threat? So, the threat is evolving. The aircraft has to improve. As you said, if it does improve, it has a wider use case for the U.S. and other nations. And it really will be a U.S. government decision as to based on the threat they’re facing and their assessment of it and our input on what the aircraft needs to do to meet it, they will make an engine decision on one of those two roads, improve what’s there today or go for an entire new technology, which is that three-stream airflow engine.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Mike Maugeri: Jim, you talked about some of the higher ad spend going towards 5G.MIL. So, I’m just wondering, are there any guideposts or signs that you’d point to that 5G.MIL is beginning to gain traction as you envision it? I guess, anything looking out that we as the investment community can measure you against?
Jim Taiclet: So Mike, a lot of this is really what we call a keep-sold effort, right? 5G.MIL is designed to, first of all, give our customers more efficient higher level of performance in missions that they’re trying to accomplish. So, one of those missions that we’ve modeled pretty deeply is called counter air, for example. The second one is surface warfare and a third one is integrated air and missile defense. We modeled those at a staff level in great detail with both Lockheed Martin and other OEM platforms contributing to those missions in an accelerated fashion and the new platforms coming on board to further enhance that mission capability. That’s a whole different way of looking at things than the defense industrial base has used in the past, in my view. And frankly, it may be different than our customers and their procurement systems have looked at it. We typically respond to RFPs as we just talked about, where government officials determine a need. They write up a detailed document to distribute to industry who can meet that need, and then we kind of individually respond with our own proposals. What we’re trying to do is adopt the tech industry’s practice of, what’s the mission we’re trying to accomplish? Is it autonomous cars at scale? Is it drone package deliveries? And then figure out what existing vehicles and platforms and systems we have that can contribute that mission and what new ones do we need to develop. But at the same time, we can upgrade that mission every 6 to 12 months. And that’s what 5G.MIL is designed to do. It’s designed to figure out how to not have to wait six years for the next NGAD platform but rather how do we integrate platforms we have today, while that NGAD is being developed over that period of time, increase our capability every 6 to 12 months. So, what 5G.MIL will do will help keep-sold a lot of Lockheed Martin platforms because we’re going to endeavor to put those capabilities on our platforms first to be a pathfinder so we get other OEMs to play with us and create a common standard set and actually have them contribute to that mission profile too. So, very complicated answer to a simple question. You’ll see it as perhaps the program or record of F-35, either to stay -- maintains or increases. You’ll see as we start linking in, hey, perhaps Future Vertical Lift will be a hopefully decision criteria because we’re going to enable that with 5G.MIL to connect to other assets. So, that’s where you’re going to see it. There may not necessarily be another affordable unit or something that comes along the way that says 5G.MIL x billion. It’s going to come in many ways through our existing platforms predominantly. And over time, we’ll hope to license some of these technologies to others and get some income that way. But this is really a keep-sold to drive the Lockheed Martin platform base forward and make the other platforms that we’re developing prospectively for our customers enabled already with that in the design phase and make them more attractive too. That’s really why we’re doing this.
Operator: Next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Jim, we’re, I think, more than three years removed from when you and the DoD open negotiations on Lot 15 on the F-35. The backlog of F-35 is actually below where it ended 2017. And I know you’re being incrementally funded for Lot 15 and beyond, but why isn’t job number one to close that contract and to sort of get on the right foot with the contract closures and getting them into the backlog?
Jim Taiclet: I’ll let John address this because he’s been around for the entire three-year period.
John Mollard: Yes.
Jim Taiclet: I could add some color at the end, maybe.
John Mollard: Yes. Myles, yes, as you mentioned, we’re still in negotiations with the Joint Program Office on Lots 15 to 17. It has proven more difficult than we expected to reach agreement on a cost baseline that incorporates the impacts that we see associated with our customer set ordering fewer aircraft in Lots 15 to 17 than were ordered in the prior buys of 12 to 14. They’re also -- we’re struggling to come to mutual agreement on the impact of global challenges that Lockheed Martin and our supply chain partners are experiencing, such as inflation and COVID-19. I’ll say we’ll continue using a data-driven process for as long as it takes to reach agreement based on what it’s actually going to cost to build these aircraft. So that said, both parties continue good faith negotiations and are diligently working to reach closure because we both recognize the importance of continuing to deliver these critical F-35 capabilities to the services and to our international partners.
Jim Taiclet: So, Myles, we’re sticking to our economics and trying to make sure that our shareholders get appropriate agreement on their behalf negotiated by our team, and we continue to strive to do that.
Operator: And next, we’ll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: John, with regard to the R&D cash tax item, I just want to make sure I have it clear. Are you saying that you now know you only need to incorporate IRAD into that, or are you saying that there’s historically, where you placed R&D tax credit will be what has to be amortized going forward? I just want to make sure I have that right. And then, Jim, on a completely different topic, in the near term here, we’re going to get the next budget request and a multiyear look from the Pentagon. Curious if you could just spend a minute on what kind of growth rates you expect to see. I mean there’s a lot of competing interests. And do you think it’s a realistic next five-year framework to think about where the ‘22 budget started with something squarely low single digit or where the ‘22 budget ended something squarely mid-single digit?
John Mollard: Yes.
Jim Taiclet: John, why don’t you do the R&D tax first and I’ll...
John Mollard: Yes. Hey, Noah, to answer your question, the framework we’re looking at for what expenses ought to be capitalized for purposes of this R&D activity, it’s broader than just IR&D but it’s not as broad as the definition that we were using previously. And it is consistent, like I said in the scripted remarks, with the framework we’re using when we calculate the R&D activity we’re doing that merits the R&D tax credit provision. So, it’s historically consistent with that approach.
Jim Taiclet: Okay. And then, on the Future Year Defense Plan or FYDP, F-Y-D-P, that is being developed in the first sort of real year of that forward-looking approach is 2023. It’s too soon to know what the percentage growth rates in the defense budget are going to be. But our expectation will be that FY22, which we’re already, again, a third of the way through, but it looks like a $740 billion number would be the base line upon which 2023 growth would be placed. And then that growth percentage, of course, is going to have to come through the administration and Congress. But if you look at -- and it’s evident each day that goes by. If you look at the evolving threat level and the approach that some countries are taking, including North Korea, Iran and through some of its proxies in Yemen and elsewhere, and especially Russia today, these days, and China, there’s renewed great power competition that does include national defense and threats to it. And the history of United States is when those environments evolve that we do not sit by and just watch it happen. So, I can’t talk to a number, but I do think and I’m concerned personally that the threat is advancing, and we need to be able to meet it. And the contribution we can make at LM is to increase the efficiency and the reliability of our products that we have today for our customer. And secondly, to try to bring this 21st century digital technology to the enterprise in a way that allows us to keep up with the adversaries while we’re developing even newer and more advanced systems.
Greg Gardner: Hey John, this is Greg. We’ve gone a little over the hour. So I think we’ve come up on the end of our call. I will turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.
Jim Taiclet: Yes. Thanks, Greg. I’d like to conclude the call by thanking the entire Lockheed Martin community for their steadfast commitment and a really challenging year for supporting our customers and each other. And we’re all going to work to put the pandemic hopefully behind us here in ‘22. I’m confident in our future because the outstanding integrity and performance and innovation of our workforce, and we’ve got like 60,000 engineers and scientists working every day to try to address these issues. And we’ll continue to support our customers and their essential missions that we just talked about. And look, I also appreciate our investors’ confidence in our capability to execute on our long-term free cash flow per share growth strategy. And thanks again to all of you then for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you in April. Bye, everybody. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-26 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the caller to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations, please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, John. And good morning. I would like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. joining me today on the call are James Taiclet, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and John Mollard, our Acting Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered Forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law.  Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the Forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the Forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www. lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.
James Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter, 2021 earnings call. In a few moments, John, will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2021 guidance and trending information for 2022. But first I will provide a five-year Sales Outlook and discuss our plans for accelerating capabilities to our customers and driving per-share value to our shareholders over that time horizon.  Last month, I lead our executive leadership team as we completed our annual strategic and financial planning process. Given the scope of changes in our operating environment over the past year, we conducted a more in-depth and extended assessment of our financial forecast. Based on these strategic and financial reviews in the information available to us today, our current expectation is that sales in 2022 will decline slightly from our expected 2021 sales level.  We then anticipate sales will increase slightly in 2023 with steadily increasing sales growth through 2026. This sales trajectory reflects a number of factors, including the continuing effects of the ongoing COVID pandemic and extended delivery timelines across our supply chain, moderating growth rates in the U.S. defense budget, shifts in customer priorities driven by recent events such as the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, and the re-nationalization of the AWE program in the UK. And our recently completed agreement with the F-35 Joint Program Office on a rebase lining of aircraft deliveries under our production program.  I'll address the significant agreement a little later in my remarks. It was all forward projections, our performance on current programs, our ability to wait highly competitive new starts, the size of future defense budgets, and the global geopolitical landscape will all influence our ultimate growth rate over the coming five years. But as we look ahead, there are four primary areas that underpin our longer-term growth forecast. The first of these future growth areas is within our Hypersonics portfolio.  We're currently performing on six Hypersonics programs across the Company, and following the successful completion of ongoing testing and evaluation activity. Multiple programs are expected to enter production between 2023 and 2026. The second growth area is within our classified activity. Three of our four business areas are engaged in significant classified development programs and pending successful achievement of the objectives within those programs. We expect to begin the transition from development to production, again, between 23 and 26.  The third area of expected growth lies in our current programs of record. Our portfolio is very well aligned with our customers mission requirements, and as a result, we have multiple programs from each business area entering growth stages. This includes the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, F-35 sustainment activity, increased PAC-3 production rates, and the modernization and enhancements to the Fleet Ballistic Missile. And, finally, we're in competition for several significant new business awards, including the future vertical lift, FLRAA and FARA competitions.  The next-generation interceptor program, and the KCY tanker program. These represent meaningful opportunities to accelerate our projected top-line growth profile with new long-term projects that are critical to our national defense. Now I would like to discuss our strategy for driving strong returns for our shareholders in the near term while remaining well positioned for our expected return to growth in 2023. The central tenet of our value creation strategy is using a disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. We will first reinvest capital into our business to meet our customers requirements and drive organic growth.  Concurrently, we will continue pursuing actionable inorganic growth opportunities that strengthen our core business. And we will return cash to shareholders through increasing dividend payments and a significantly expanded share re-purchase program. To drive sustainable organic growth, we will continue making significant investments in our business area. These investments include nearly $2 billion of annual capital expenditures and approximately $1.5 billion in independent research and development spending each year.  These investments are being made in our signature platforms and systems to provide our customers with the high-value solutions they're going to need to execute their missions of deterring if necessary defeating the pacing threats across all domains of operations. Additionally, we are transforming our internal operations with a model-based engineering and enterprise architecture. And we are building digital factories of the future. These investments and state-of-the-art engineering, manufacturing, and sustainment tools and techniques will ensure our business areas can continue delivering outstanding performance leveled on current programs, while also positioning us to prevail an upcoming campaigns.  After making these significant investments in our business to support our customers, and drive organic growth, we expect to have substantial free cash flows available to return to you, the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Last month, the board increased our quarterly dividends by $0.20, or approximately 8% to $2.80 per share, and now $11.20 per share annually, providing shareholders, especially our yield investors, with strong returns. This action marks the 20th consecutive year that the board increased Lockheed Martin's quarterly dividend.  Along with making an increased quarterly dividend payment, we will also provide additional value to shareholders by returning excess cash to them through a greatly expanded share repurchase program. As discussed in today's press release, we've already repurchased $2 billion of our shares through the first three quarters of 2021. And last month, on my recommendation, the board increased our remaining share repurchase authority by $5 billion, bringing our current total share repurchase authority to approximately $6 billion. With our stock trading at a level well below what we calculate as the Company's intrinsic value, we have significantly increased our planned share buybacks, and I anticipate that we will repurchase up to $6 billion of our shares over the next 12, 18 months, if conditions warrant.  As a final note on shareholder value, we're going to dynamically allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, prioritizing investments that lead to growing free cash flow per share. That's our new metric. We will remain opportunistic and pursuing accretive bolt-on acquisitions, evaluate additional increases to our current share purchase authorization, and continue to reinvest capital to our business to drive long-term growth. We have the Balance Sheet flexibility and firepower to pursue multiple avenues of growth while returning significant capital to our shareholders.  We built this Balance Sheet to use it and we will do so. Consistent with our focus on long-term shareholders value creation. Our strong Balance Sheet provides us with the capability to close on the Aerojet Rocketdyne transaction, provide robust returns to shareholders and continue to invest in our portfolio to support our customers and drive future growth. The Aerojet Rocketdyne transaction continues moving through the regulatory approval process and we now anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022.  Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to highlight the efforts of the entire F-35 organization, including the government's Joint Program office, our teammates and suppliers, our Aeronautics Organization, and our international partners for establishing a new aircraft production baseline and delivery profile that will provide industry government, partner countries and FMS customers, as well as you, the investor community, with important visibility well into the future. The program is strong and stable, and we have opportunities ahead of us to add to that strength. The program has delivered over 700 production aircraft out of a plan of record of over 3,300 jets, including to all 3 U.S. services and 9 international customers so far. And we look forward to continuing the successful program for decades to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to John and I'll rejoin you to answer your questions.
John Mollard: Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of third quarter activity. Starting with sales, we recorded revenue of $16 billion. This result was below our expectation as we realized larger than anticipated supply chain impacts across Aeronautics, Missiles, and Fire Control in space. These impacts span multiple suppliers and our expectation is that we will incrementally recover from these disruptions over the next 12-18 months. Despite this reduction in sales volume, our segment operating profit increased year-over-year to $1.9 billion on strong operational performance across the enterprise.  Our earnings per share of $2.21 included a non-cash charge of $4.72 related to our previously announced pension transaction. We generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations and continued our practice of accelerating payment store supply chain with $1.5 billion and accelerated payments at quarter-end. The supply chain disruptions we experienced during the third quarter, underscore the fact that many of our suppliers are still dealing with the financial stress caused by the global pandemic. In addition, we continue to return substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchase activity.  And we have provided trending data for 2022, which we will discuss further in a few minutes. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. As we noted in our earnings release, our third quarter sales are below 2020 levels, primarily because of the re-nationalization of the atomic weapons establishment program in our space business area. Our third quarter sales also reflect recent supply chain delays, most notably on the F-35 production activity, and on several production programs within both Missiles and Fire Control and space.  Despite this reduction in sales volume, our third quarter segment operating profit is up from last year. A strong operational performance resulted in significant risk retirements across all four business areas. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the quarter. Our earnings per share of $2.21 incorporates a $4.72 non-cash charge associated with the $4.9 billion pension liability transfer we completed back in August. On an adjusted basis, our pre -transaction earnings per share of $6.93, was 11% higher than our 2020 results due to improved segment operating margins, reduced share account, and another quarter of mark-to-market gains across our Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio.  While future volatility associated with investments in early-stage companies is expected, the significant gains realized across multiple holdings in our Ventures portfolio reinforce the value of investing in and partnering with companies focused on cutting-edge technologies. On Chart 6, we will look at our year-to-date cash generation and deployment. Subtracting our capital expenditures from almost $5 billion of cash from operations, our year-to-date free cash flow is greater than $4 billion. We've repurchased $2 billion of shares year-to-date, including $500 million during the third quarter, and have made more than $2 billion in dividend payments.  In total, our balanced cash deployment of nearly $4.2 billion represents over 100% of free cash flow return to our shareholders year-to-date. And we will continue these shareholder-friendly actions going forward as evidenced by our recent dividend increase and share repurchase program announcements. Moving onto Chart 7 in our 2021 guidance update, we've lowered our 2021 Outlook for sales and segment operating profit to reflect the previously discussed supply chain impacts that emerged in August and September. We've reduced our outlook for cash from operations primarily to reflect our updated plan to maintain our current $1.5 billion level of accelerated payments to our supply chain.  We plan to continue supporting our suppliers as they recover from pandemic related impacts, especially small and medium businesses both across the country and Internationally, to help maintain program schedules, and customer missions. The four-year outlook for earnings per share has increased $0.35 from the midpoint of last quarter's range, driven by Lockheed Martin Ventures investment gains and several non-operational items. Now, turning to Chart 8, we take a closer look at the current year revisions to 2021 sales by business area. As discussed, Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control and space have all been affected by lower than anticipated activity coming through our supply chain.  The level of reduction in supply chain activity over the past two months is higher than what we've been experiencing since the beginning of the pandemic and our 2021 Sales Outlook internationally assumes that we will see a return to more normal activity levels in the fourth quarter. In addition, our Sales Outlook for 2021, and our trending information for 2022 excludes any potential impacts associated with the recent Executive Order on safety protocols for Federal contractors. On Chart 9, we see segment operating profit tracking with the reduction in expected sales volume, and our expected segment operating margin outlook remains at 11%. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our initial trending information for 2022.  We've estimated 2022 sales at approximately $66 billion, a decline of 1.5% from our projected 2021 results. As a reminder, the renationalization of our work and support the United Kingdom's atomic weapons establishment earlier this year, creates a headwind of just under $900 million on a year-over-year basis. We're expecting segment operating margins to remain at approximately 11% and we're projecting growth and cash from operations year-over-year to greater than, or equal to $8.4 billion. This Outlook assumes there will be no increase in tax payments related to capitalizing R&D costs. If current legislation is not amended, our cash from operations outlook could be reduced by up to $2 billion. Also, given we continue experiencing impacts across our supply chain, we now anticipate maintaining accelerated payments at the current $1.5 billion level through year-end 2022. Our prior multiyear cash forecast assume there would no longer be a need to accelerate payments to our supply chain beyond 2021. We are currently assuming a statutory corporate tax rate of 21% And we have not including any financial projections associated with closing the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition, which as Jim mentioned, is now expected to occur during the first quarter of 2022, subject to required regulatory approval. Turning to pension-related assumptions, interest rates have increased since year-end 2020. Our year-to-date actual returns have been higher than previously expected, and we've lowered our long-term rate of return to 6.5%.  In a response to investors asking for additional information on pension trends, we have included two charts on this topic in the appendix. These trends include no required pension contributions through 2025 based on current assumptions. On Chart 11, we outlined our expected capital deployment activities for 2022. We anticipate spending approximately $2 billion on capital projects next year, which represents an increase of approximately $300 million over expected 2021 levels. In addition, we anticipate investing approximately $1.5 billion on independent research and development activities, which represents a $200 million increase over planned 2021 levels. These investments are being made to enhance our delivery of critical systems and products to our customers as they execute their national security missions while ensuring we are well-positioned to compete for new business opportunities.  We will be making over $3 billion in dividend payments next year based on our recently announced $0.20 per share increase to our quarterly dividend rate. And as Jim shared earlier, we will also continue to strategically buy back shares when we believe they are trading below intrinsic value as they are now. We are planning to opportunistically repurchase up to $6 billion in shares over the next 12 to 18 months. We are confident we have the Balance Sheet flexibility and firepower to pursue all avenues of growth, while returning significant capital to our shareholders.  On chart 12, we provide some additional detail on our expected long-term trajectory for F-35 sales. As Jim commented earlier, we recently reached agreement with the Joint Program Office on our expected F-35 delivery plan. This joint plan represents the best intersection of production operations and supply chain capabilities. Technology insertion and supportive increasing mission requirements in both the timing and quantity of anticipated new production aircraft award decisions. We are very pleased with the outcome of this joint production replan as it provides stability and predictability across all key elements of this program.  Deliveries are expected to grow to a 156 aircraft by 2023 and will remain at that level for the foreseeable future. We are projecting F-35 production sales in 2022 will be lower than 2021 levels, and sales will also decline slightly in 2023. Revenues are expected to remain around 2023 levels throughout the balance of the forecasted timeframe. As we've previously discussed, the growth in F-35 sales volume will primarily be driven by sustainment activity as the number of deployed aircraft and associated flight hours grows rapidly, while we continue to aggressively pursue cost takeout in partnership with our customer.  Finally, we're also projecting modest growth and development activity as our customers continue seeking further advancements and capabilities for our unrivaled fifth-generation aircraft. To conclude on Chart 14, we have our summary. We've reduced our 2021 Outlook based on the higher-than-expected supply chain impacts we experienced during the third quarter. The supply chain and related production impacts, along with our updated F-35 production plan and the other factors Jim mentioned, have shaped our Outlook for 2022 and our future expectations.  Our strong Balance Sheet and cash generation give us multiple options to deploy cash and to echo Jim, we will prioritize investments, which will grow free cash flow per share. And with our broad portfolio, dedicated employees, strong Balance Sheet, and a disciplined in dynamic capital allocation strategy, we remain focused on our customers mission and long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: Certainly. And ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please [Operator Instructions]. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the 1-0 command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. [Operator Instructions] And first go the line of Rich Safran with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Jim, John, Greg, Good morning. Jim, John, I have a two-part question here on your 2020 to guide your long-term cash flow guide, and some of your opening remarks. What's the baseline budget that you're assuming in your guide? And specifically, if the plus-ups to the President's request from HASC and SASC are included, did that imply some upside to your '22 guide, or is it just to late for fiscal '22 funding to have an impact? And the second parts of my question is, so you lowered your cash from operations guide for '22. I want to know if you could discuss a bit more about what you think cash flow looks like beyond '22 and what you're assuming along with that. Thanks
John Mollard: Yeah. Thanks, Richard. It's John. I'll take both parts of that two-part question. So first, in regards to the assumptions in and around the budget vary based on. We're using the president's budget of $715 billion for the government fiscal year 2022 in the trending information we've given you. I'd say we're encouraged by the direction of the various committee markups as they reflect really good support for a number of our programs. And to your question about how much if any of this will come through in 2022, the answer to that question is going to be based on how much incremental funding is actually appropriated, how long it takes for that appropriated funding to end up getting on contract with us and us following that down to our supply chain.  And then the third factor is what specific programs the incremental appropriations are applied to. It's easier, obviously, to maintain programs at current run rates than it is to accelerate programs. So any programs that we're planning in a trend down would be really good candidates for being able to see opportunities in 2022 related to increased appropriations. I'll finish this action by saying, obviously, by the time we're in January when we're giving you an updated outlook for 2022, we should have a lot more clarity in and around the budgetary trends. Now, turning to your second part, which had to do with -- we'd previously given multiyear -- operating cash flow guidance and of course, all these metrics are going to be assuming the R&D tax change does not go into effect our prior guidance was like 89991.  You've seen we've got our guidance now at 83 for this year and 84 for next year. And I will say we anticipate higher than 84 operating cash flow guidance as we look ahead to 2023. But really the only factor that's changed since the multiyear guidance we gave before is in the level and the duration of the accelerated payments we're planning to make to our supply chain. I think I mentioned in the script, we have previously in that 89991 track assumed we would be accelerating $1.2 billion worth of accelerated payments of the supply chain at year-end -- at the end of this year.  But then the assumption was the pandemic would be behind us in 2022, we'd unwind that program, we'd end 2022 with no accelerated payments being made through our supply chain. Our current forecast, the 83 and 84 assumes we're at $1.5 billion of accelerated payments at the end of this year and $1.5 billion of accelerated payments at the end of 2022. So the pandemic impacts are behind us. Before we end year-end 2022, our guide of 84 would increase by that $1.5 billion.
Richard Safran: Thank you.
John Mollard: You're welcome, Rich.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research, please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
John Mollard: Good morning Rob.
Robert Stallard: Jim, just a quick question and clarification on your five-year Sales Outlook, did you say you expected sales growth to accelerate after 2023? And then secondly, as a question, what are your expectations for operating margins over this period? Thank you.
James Taiclet: I'll speak to growth, Rob and make a point on operating margin then John can pick up on. Based on Hypersonics, classified programs, programs of record like CH-53K and others, we do believe that we'll have a rebound to meaningful growth 2023 and beyond. But again, that's also dependent on a number of factors, including the budget, etc., that we've just talked about. So yes, that is the idea, and frankly, we want to use this year-to period to accelerate share repurchase, reduced the accounts so when that inflection point does come on growth you will have as shareholders, basically an amplified benefit during that latter period, if you will. So we fully expect that with margins being pretty steady along the way, right John?
John Mollard: Yeah. Absolutely. So Rob, I mean, just to kind of put stop with what Jim was saying to give a little color. The four categories that Jim mentioned is scripted remarks, Hypersonics, classified growth and programs record and competitive new starts. When I look at that subset of revenue, for those 4 categories in 2021, it's in the neighborhood of $17 billion. Over the period growing out through for the next 5 years, that set of activity, assuming we hit our operational marks, assuming these programs continue on their programs of record, and we win our share of these competitive new business opportunities that we've talked about, that $17 billion worth of program revenue today will grow at about 9% compound annual growth rate, which gives me some level of comfort that the longer-term trends that Jim has talked about will hold just to reiterate.  We're expecting a slight decline in 22 and bounce back in 2023. And then I would say increasing growth and increasing growth rates going forward now. Yes. On the topic of margins, I think 11% is a good working target for us given the evolution in our portfolio and the activity that we see going forward. I just highlighted the four categories that we'll be seeing growth, a lot of those are new start programs. There is going to be some growth in programs are record which we would hope to turn into accretive margin program. But there is a lot of growth in new start areas, developmental areas. The good news is we will get -- there will be cost reimbursable contracts, will have assurance of recovery of the costs we're incurring.  But they by definition will be lower margin activities moving forward. And I should mention, and this is just to get this on the record early, there are certain classified activities that we can't talk about but if those programs continue to progress along the track that they're on, my expectation is we will be making investments in some of those programs out in the '23, '24, '25 timeframe that will be dilutive to margins. But I think in balance on 11% operating margin is a good metric for us.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Mike Maugeri: Hey, good morning. Thank you for the time. So following on Rob's question, and you gave us the four priorities underpinning the growth forecast -- but Jim or John, can you give more specific and sort of quantify these buckets. How they translate to revenue in further into your outlook beyond 22 for a return to growth. And then separately, what headwinds are you anticipating to offset these growth buckets?
John Mollard: Yeah. Sure Mike, it's John. I'll take and I will talk semantically first through the four buckets and growth over time, and then maybe now, as good a time as any to talk specifically about what we're seeing in moving from '21 to '22 and they headwinds, but the four big buckets, the first one is Hypersonic activity. Today, we're doing about $1.5 billion worth of revenue in that area. If we are able to move a number of those activities into -- from development into production, which we fully expect will happen, we're making great progress on a number of them that are visible and are being reported on today. But our projection would be assuming a number of those activities proceed into a production environment, that billion-and-a-half dollars to gross highest $3 billion by 2026. The second area classified in -- I'll say upfront we hesitated even highlighting this, given there's not a lot that we can say in general about classified activity.  But because it is a large and growing component of our business, we thought it was important at least give you top-level trend information. And because, like I said, we will be making investments in some of this activity downstream, which will have dilutive impacts, I thought it was a good idea to talk about. But in aggregate our classified portfolio will grow, we expect at a rate above 5%, so that is a strong growing area for us. The programs of record which as Jim take through some of the big ones you mentioned will be CH-53K, F-35 sustainment.  The PAC-3 program, and then additional growth in the Fleet Ballistic Missile and evolutions and new advances in that program that portfolio today is worth about $8.5 billion. When we project out to 2026 over that period of time, the compound annual growth rate in that program set is like an 8% and it's highlighted by CH-53K, where we will be delivering out to a program of record of 200 units. I think the final deliveries are made in 2032, but just keeping that program on its program of record will go a long way towards us achieving that growth in the program of record, Greg just talked about.  And then the final area is the new business, which are a set of wildcards. You're going to get binary decisions in and around the FLRAA competition, the FARA competition. One of the new business areas that Jim talked about as next-generation interceptor. We successfully moved into a down select, where there's ourselves and one other competitor. We're making great progress. We've achieved a number of important program milestones recently, we feel good about where we're heading.  But that'll be a down select and then sort of the wildcard in the bunch. An opportunity we're very excited about is the KCY tanker program, where we've announced that we will be teaming with Airbus, who we think as a very capable frame for doing this mission. I think we bring extensive experience in the mission capabilities that would go onto that Air frame. I think we make a very formidable team. We're very excited about that opportunity. And depending on outcomes, I mean, obviously, we're doing next enough and either any of those programs besides the next-generation interceptor.  Yeah, that growth rate could be explosive. If we prevail on FLRAA and FARA, which we think we're very well-positioned to do, if we're down selected on NGI and a tanker program is awarded to us, there will be substantial growth in that bucket. And they headwinds, I guess like I said, now, let's tactically kind of walk through the 2021 outlook of roughly $67 billion and how that translates as we look ahead to 2022. Obviously you look at the math and we're down about a billion dollars.  The obvious large year-to-year headwind is related to the AWE re-nationalization, which I believe either Jim or I talked about, in our script is being a headwind of just under $900 million. The second headwind you'll see on our F-35 revenue chart, we're projecting a decrease in F-35 production related revenue up about $400 million moving from '21 to '22. And then we have two programs that are sort of in international lifecycle evolution, very successful programs, but they delivered out, and that's the Black Hawk helicopter program. And by delivered out, I mean, it's on the -- it's moving down from the peak. The number of helicopters we're going to deliver this year will be cut in half by the time we're two years out.  And then our highly successful next-generation OPI or program, both of those programs, moving from '21 to '22, if you combine the downtick in revenue, that aggregates to about $600 million. And then one of the other external factors was the recently announced and executed withdrawal of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. The primary impact to us is in a contract of special ops, logistics support program and we had some other Afghan draw down related impacts. In total it's about a $200 million a year-over-year headwind. But now as I pivot to the plus side, one of the programs, it's ramping up.  Year-over-year, is one of those in the -- I call it competitive category. We talked about the next-generation interceptor where we're doing about $200 million in revenue in 2021. We expect to do about $600 million of revenue in 2022. we have a lot of growth, as we mentioned within our classified activity. A lot of that activity is being done in our skunk works organization within aeronautics. That work is going to be growing about $400 million year-over-year. And a final large program, a record growth is in the CH-53K heavy lift, where we'd expect to see $300 million year-over-year growth. So on balance, it's down that the headwind is removal of the AWE activity we were doing.
Operator: Our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research, please go ahead.
George Shapiroi: Yes. Just to follow up on your comments on the sectors. First, AWE at $900 million hit, I thought that program had been running more like three or 350 million a quarter. And obviously it's really only the first half that overlaps for 21 to 22, so if you comment on that. And then if you looked at each of the sectors there, I would think that the Aeronautics would be down maybe a billion, billion and a half dollars. But you'd get some growth in RMS, you get some growth in Space x, the AWE. So if you could just kind of comment on that status.
John Mollard: Sure, George. Thanks for the question. So if you go back to our first second quarter press releases that -- we probably haven't the year-to-date. AWE first quarter activity this year was $440 million, AWE activity in the second quarter was $435 million some those still you get the $875 million level of activity, we saw probably higher than what you might have remembered because you had a lot of wrap-up associated activity that took place, but say $875 million in 2021 that won't recur. And maybe what I'll do is do a high level sort of around the horn of how those the headwinds and tailwinds play out by segment.  The first segment we talked about is Aeronautics. As we look ahead to '22 we're expecting low single-digit growth rates in Aeronautics with a slight increase in margins, think of 10-20 basis point range. Within Missiles and Fire Control, we're actually expecting a slight decline, a low -- think of it as a low-single-digit decline with margins slightly lower than 2021 levels at again, 10 - 20 basis points. If you go to RMS, we're expecting a low single-digit decline as well, with margins maybe up to 40 basis points below what we going to end up with in 2021. And then finally at Space, we're expecting mid-single-digit declines. Obviously, that's where the AWE reduction takes place. With margins comparable to what we were expecting for 2021.
James Taiclet: George, it's Jim. Just to give you a little more color on, just pick one RMS. John already mentioned the Black Hawk is going to be down next year-to-year, and the CH-53K is up. They actually offset each other. So in 2022 it's a launch between, let's call it those two programs. And then similarly we get combat rescue helicopter upside, maybe 100 million, but probably the plan is VH-92A production down about 100 to 150 million they upset. You might remember that we were part of the Australia Future Conventional Sub program.  Well, that's gotten deferred into a nuclear submarine propulsion option, and we're going to compete for that, but it's going to be a while before that kicks in. There's another 150, so. There are puts and takes in every VA, if you will. And it's part of -- again, new administration, some changes in priorities, changes in alliances. I think they all settle out to the good, but it's going to take a couple of years to get through all that kind of maneuvering. And we're going to do the best we can in the next couple of years to make sure that there's a flattish period for our Company.  As far as revenue, we're going to really Double down or triple down on returning cash to shareholders because we've got it. And the other thing I'd say, George real quick to add on to something that John said earlier. We are voluntarily continuing our acceleration of payments to supply chain. This is something for the good of the industry, for the good of the customer and we will want to contribute as all of us are in our own ways in this country to recovering from COVID. And again, when -- as John said, when COVID subsides, we will get that cash flow number back to where you thought it was going to be in the first place. So just a couple of color commentaries on there because I think you guys are asking some really good questions.
Operator: And next we go to Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Yes. Good morning. Hey, guys, can you give us greater insight into the supply chain because it seems like we're in a period here where cash flow terms are unusually generous. So it's hard to understand why they'd be in such financial strain. Is it all related to things like just labor availability or COVID mandates or semiconductor shortage? Can you give us greater insight as to why the supply chain is in such dire strains, given the cash flow terms that they've been operating under?
John Mollard: Yeah. Pete, good question. And I think a large part of the impact that our supply chain is facing our, in our suppliers that are dual use. I mean, they're supplying to both commercial aerospace and defense. So if we're looking at parts of the supply chain that are strictly defense, they're probably not nearly as stress financially as our dual use suppliers, people that don't make landing gear for us and they'll make landing gear for commercial aircraft, they make brakes.  Those are the suppliers that have fixed operating costs that have seen substantial revenue decreases on the commercial supply on that have really caught in to their operating cash flow. And we think it's the right thing to do. We have access to capital, we have access to cash at extremely good rate. We generate a lot of cash flow. It's in -- as Jim said, it's in the industry's interest, it's in our customers interest, and frankly, there is an element of self-preservation here, we need our supply chain to be successful for us to be successful. So while it's voluntary, it's not a 100% Altria. I mean, we need to make commitments. We need especially our dual use vendors and partners, our supply chain partners to be successful for the long term.
Operator: And next we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning. Maybe if we could just back up the aperture a little bit. Jim, when you first came on board, you talked a lot about focus on the 21st Century war fighter, war fighting, connectivity, that sort of thing. Then we shifted a little bit maybe with the acquisition of Rocketdyne. And now here we are. It seems like the story has now shifted to the cash return story with no growth. And I think, what's on a lot of people's mind is ultimately, what is the strategy? I mean, where you've taken a Company and what's the vision here. It really seems -- -- and all this maybe might sound unfair, but it seems a little bit loose right now. At least from an outsider's perspective, if you could give us some color on that?
James Taiclet: When you're run a business, Ron in a dynamic industry with changing government, when government is your major customer, you've got to be agile, right? Now the first thing you mentioned is the long-term strategy to companies. We're going to deliver on our programs of record where that drive operational excellence, but we're driving it towards a mission-oriented paradigm at the end of the day at Lockheed Martin versus a product paradigm, which we've been operating under since at least before World War II. So that paradigm is still there. We're working towards it.  In the meantime, we got to deliver for you all as shareholders financially and we got to deliver for our customers operationally. But I'm getting -- I'd like to think tremendous traction with senior government officials in the U.S. and elsewhere that understand that while our industry and their purchase of our products and services over the years has been effective, it's largely effective in the physical world, if you will. [inaudible 00:48:29] world. We're really good at technologies like Hypersonics, Space Travel, Precision Weapons, etc.  Those are [Indiscernible] world we're really good at that as an industry and our customer knows how to buy that stuff. Well, we're not as good as we need to be in the defense industry is merging that excellence in the physical world that we can bring to national defense. But merging that with the developments, the accelerated developments in the digital world by companies that have specialized in things like 5G and AI distributed computing and networking. Because if we merge those two things together in the ways that we're forecasting and we're building technology roadmaps to do, we will increase the effectiveness of our current set of platforms and a faster and more robust way than can be done, and just using the attributes in the physical world technologies.  We're going to keep doing all of that, but we can actually turn on an after burner for mission capability for our customers by accelerating those digital technologies into our space and that is our strategy. The benefit of that is in addition to having a more effective national defense at relatively efficient cost, is that it will make our platforms more attractive than relative at the other OEMS platforms, because we intend to build the Architecture first with its path liners with some of our platforms and bringing others as we get some success. That is a strategy of the Company.  It is not changed in IOTA, but our capital allocation strategies had to change because of dynamic situations we find ourselves in externally. And in our M&A, approach has had to evolve because there's not that much supply out there in our industry as far as acquisition candidates have any scale and a regulatory environment is also shifting a bit. So we're shifting with it and we're saying okay, we still got our baseline strategy. Twenty-First Century warfare is we're, we need to end up down the road with our customer. We wanted to get there partly through acquisition like Aerojet Rocketdyne and i3 to get the technology is mainly in the physical world that we need to move those things forward.  But the M&A window isn't that open right now for valuation, availability, and regulatory regime. We just think in doing the things that you have to do when you're running an actual business in the real-world, which is being agile. The one thing I want to add to that because there may be some misconception about -- Ron. Thank you for the question. By the way, it open this up. I want to make absolutely clear that our M&A approach, does not and has not included the acquisition of major commercial technology or telecom companies.  We're not trying to become that. We want to use their IP, their people to accelerate that kind of technology, that digital technology in our world. So our approach is to partner with industry leaders in those spaces via commercial agreements, licensing, joined teaming, and participation standards bodies to accelerate those capabilities into our technology road maps. We have no intention of acquiring emerging with any of those major commercial sector companies. So yeah, you've got to be dynamic and agile when you run a business this big in the real world, and that's what we're up to. And we still have our target being the past liner towards 21st Century National Defense.
John Mollard: And Ron, this is John. Just to pile on to what Jim said. He's done a very good job of articulating a strategy from an external perspective, but as guided spend with this Company for over 30 years, what I most see and resonate with is how gyms actively change in the culture across Lockheed Martin internally. To embrace any kind of innovative technology, despite where they come from we've had allowed of really bright creative scientists and engineers, but we don't have to invent the solution to every single problem. And historically we've struggled with some level of not-invented-here, which probably may come as no surprise to somebody yet.  What Jim has been stressing and our team is getting is, we need to identify and partner with whoever does have the best solution in an industry agnostic manner. And I think we're doing a pretty good job of that in our ventures, investment fund, where we're going to startups, and seeing the art of the possible. We're starting to get pull demand from the business areas for some of these technologies, which I personally view as a huge step in the right direction. And it's drive in that mindset, the openness to technology across the entire R&D and engineering community. So I haven't seen a change and I appreciate the direction from an internal perspective.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, just a quick reminder, if you do have a question, please press [Operator Instructions] at this time. And next we will go to the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. I think certainly the markets -- looking at the 22 cascade in particular. And John I just want to clarify something. So the 1.5 billion of supplier advances that you mentioned you hadn't planned on, are those net from -- in other words, are you suggesting that the prior guidance included zero, now it's 1.5, and so pro forma and the move from the prior guidance is operationally towards the 9.5 billion?
John Mollard: Yes.
Myles Walton: So then it's 23, 9.9 billion?
John Mollard: Let me make sure we're tracked, and the prior guide was [Indiscernible] and 9.
Myles Walton: Yeah.
John Mollard: Today, we're doing [Indiscernible], and in that [Indiscernible] is a billion-and-a-half that was not there. So we're up $300 million. I'm telling you, today, our [Indiscernible] is going to be higher -- will be higher than [Indiscernible] in 2023. Depending on how much we still have to accelerate in 2023, are that number can be anywhere from a billion dollars higher to $100 million higher or $200 million higher. So the punch line is if you think about the two years, '21 and '22 were ahead, dependent on the outcome of where COVID is and either '22 or '23, we could be equal to or slightly behind the prior multiyear guidance if that makes sense.
Myles Walton: It does, but I guess the question is these are advances that presumably rotate back to you. So that's why I'm asking, about '23 and beyond. Would be [inaudible 00:55:25]
James Taiclet: So you don't get the full benefit of a 1.5 billion because this is a rolling -- a roll-off, if you will, quarter-to-quarter as you go through the year. So there's some subset of that as John is saying. Depending when the music stops, we will be able to then elevate the cash flow we report because we didn't do a quarter or two of the typical flow - throughs to the supply chain.
John Mollard: Right.
James Taiclet: That's going to be the whole year.
John Mollard: Yes. Just to make sure we're on 100% the same baseline. The old guidance was 89, 90, 91. Today, let's just use as a baseline 83, 84 and 85, that's down $1.8 billion. If we're at 85, we've got over a billion dollars of assumed advances at the end of 2023. So you could say notionally, where we're sitting here today over the three-year period were down $800 million and some of that is driven by what I've now assumed in terms of -- we have an internal term. It's funding that we are authorization spending we do in advance of contract turn - ons based on history, there's a high likelihood that some of these programs on a shift from development to production, but customer funding profiles aren't going to align with need dates. we are anticipating that we will be carrying a substantial amount of costs associated with that transition.
Myles Walton: I'll stick to one. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai Von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. So. Jim, I'm a little confused with the capital deployment. You talk about spending an incremental amount in terms of IRND, you're going to increase the dividend, you have less CAS recovery. You talked of 6.6 billion of stock repurchase. But if you do AJRD, you can't do any stock repurchase unless you really living up a balance sheet. What kind of a balance sheet a net debt to EBITDA ratio are you looking for over this period?
John Mollard: Hey, Cai, it's John, I'll take that. If you look at our operating cash flow and free cash flow or net debt retirements over the -- I'll stick to the first three years of the plan. Our excess cash balances would allow us to do the $6 billion we're talking about and still have enough liquidity to run the business, so that's point 0.1. The $6 billion is just deploying what would otherwise have been set in my bank account, earning 25 basis points. That's 0.1. 0.2 with AJRD, our original expectation was, we were probably finance call it 3 billion of the 4.5 and used cash for the other 1.5 billion. I'm leaning now towards, especially given how low financing rates are, maybe financing the entire acquisition.  But kind of more broadly, the way I think about acquisitions and I know Jim and I are absolutely in a 100% violent agreement on this. If you can find M&A that has the right operational fit, the right culture fit, and the right strategic fit, M&A pays for itself. I mean, it's free. You have to finance some upfront but if it's a good deal, you're going to get your money back very quickly. So I view like Jim does, M&A is not a drain on your Balance Sheet. Our Balance Sheet, as you know, is single A. Our metrics would support a higher rating.  We're a minus for the two that do use the A minus scale. Conversations I've been having was it's hard to justify why we're in A minus instead of a flat A. The punch line is we've got a tremendous amount of firepower. If as Jim talked about the discipline and dynamic capital allocation process says, we need to put additional resources in here, there or wherever. We're going to have the ability to do that.
James Taiclet: And from a leverage perspective, we've got upside. I mean, we're -- we've got a strong Balance Sheet and really tried to emphasize in the prepared remarks that we see tremendous value in share repurchase at these pricing levels. We will go to the capital markets to get the resources to make the smartest capital allocation at that point in time, and we'll manage the leverage as we go. And we can do it all. Everything you said, we can do it all and maintain a reasonable leverage ratio, I believe, and a strong credit rating. I also, and John also believe so.
Operator: Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hello, everyone.
John Mollard: Hello.
Noah Poponak: I guess I'm still trying to better understand how much of the growth projection shortfall versus what the market was looking for is, end market versus Lockheed programs. And I know Jim, you talked about there being multiple puts and takes. But AWE, I guess you're saying a few years of flat revenue to up low-single-digit growth. What do you assume -- are you assuming that's what outlays are doing, putting the 22 authorizations specifically aside, is that where you're assuming outlays are doing, are you assuming you're worse than outlays? And then specifically at MFC, what's happened at MFC, because one point the growth rate was high, the Company was saying good growth was sustainable, that there was really just capital and supply constraint. Now it's down in the quarter and you're saying it's down next year, so that seems to have changed a decent amount.
John Mollard: It's John. I'll take the question. I would characterize the '21 to '22 headwinds as maybe being unique to us in some regards, although companies have a lot of exposure or had a lot of exposure to Afghanistan, for example. They may have similar headwinds. But I'd say the '21 to '22 headwinds are maybe confined to us, but the out-year growth, I think when I looked at the last track on the President's Budget, the growth rate was 2%. A year for government fiscal year '23, '24, '25 and out. I see that as a center point. Again, if we're able though, to prevail in competitions, I see a path for us to grow faster than that rate. We need to perform on our programs, we need to deliver helicopters and airplanes on our committed schedules, and if we do that, I see upside to the 2% growth that's in the President's budget.
James Taiclet: And in MFC more specifically, the PAC-3 production is going to go up and we've been investing in that capacity as you know. But it's going to go up a couple 100 million and then again, if you do puts and takes that special ops logistics support program itself was [Indiscernible]. In MFC, just that one program takes away all the PAC-3 growth year-over-year into '22, and then we had probably not as well known but a for the for MFC is significant cancellation in the UK there's no warrior armored vehicle program that was canceled by the UK government and that was another $100 million downdraft. And then that is tailing off a little bit too now and production rates. not much, but another 100 million.  So you really have to dig in the details in each VA to see why '21, '22, '23 effects are happening. But we really are focusing on 2023 plus, so to speak, or beyond 2023, because all of these programmatic effects will be known by then. we've got those four big areas where we assume and expect that there's going to be material upside. We'll understand that way better at that point. And then we'll have some of those new starts that if the competition stay on time, we may know some decisions and those too.  So there's going to be some puts and takes at Lockheed Martin specifically the next couple of years, but we're positioning ourselves to weather this period and get through with a lower share count -- materially, I think lower share count by the end of it. And then a growth factor that has an inclination to it post 2023. And that's really our overall financial strategy is to work the share count, rewards shareholders along the way, and then an inflection point in growth is what we're aiming for. That's our goal.
Operator: Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies, please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. And thank you for including me.
John Mollard: Thanks, Sheila.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe just to follow up on Noah 's question. If we could talk about the shorter term, 2022 and 2023, because I do think that's what investors are focused on. What could be the potential element of upside surprise? You guys mentioned 8.5 billion of the portfolio is focused on growing programs like CH-53K and PAC-3. Is that what we would look to or there're other elements that come in?
John Mollard: Yes. Thanks, Sheila. I think its growth and opportunities across the big four categories that Jim has articulated. A lot of our potential upside in 2023 is going to come from programs that are right now in operational testing, assuming they're able to achieve success through that, those test programs they are going to migrate into production. In the period where you still have an overlap between development and production that's where you're going to start seeing some bulge and that kind of transition ties into the probably to extended discussion how with Myles, about if you look out at the 2023 year yield, you acumen to three years while you slightly down from the last guide.  I think we're going to be successful, we're going to need to bridge those programs to maintain their critical schedule, so we're going to carry a financial backstop against them. But there is absolutely no doubt the growth is going to come out of hypersonics, classified and growth in the programs are record. I mean, Jim mentioned PAC-3 growing 200 million going from '21 to '22. In '21 we're going to deliver 350 routes, were going to be delivering 500 in 2023 and 550 million in 2025. So PAC-3 growth is going to be very strong in that period of time and CH-53K really starts levering. And if we -- when we prevail on the Future Vertical Lift Program, you will see an inflection point as well.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thank you, John.
John Mollard: You're welcome Sheila.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to really go to two issues that I think are related. In talking about strategy and in the past, we've talked about JADC2 and a lot of the things you're thinking about long term, which I think of is important as platform as may be, is much more about systems, processing, software, sensors, cams, and so forth, and integration. But when I look at where F-35 is today, one of the big challenges, there is an integration program, and it's been Tech Refresh 3 that I think, by any measure, has not gone the way it has hoped -- been hoped. Can you talk about where tech refresh 3 to move to block 4 stands today, what risks that may pose for F-35 rates going forward? But then also, if you extrapolate that and if I'm to think about doing broader systems of architectures across domains, how do I get confident that the integration capabilities you have are the best to deliver on that? So it's the combination of both the F-35 situation and taking that to a long-term strategy.
James Taiclet: Sure, Douglas, it's Jim. So I'll start with TR-3, which a just a microcosm of the larger picture. But an important one TR-3 gives you -- and I supply this jets. Similar ones, at least. It gives you a better cockpit display, a more processing for data in the airplane, and more data storage in the airplane. All good things for 21st Century warcraft. Although they are not essential to beginning the journey into networking that jet more closely with other systems and other platforms. So we're doing those two things parallel [inaudible 01:09:30] independent. TR-3 has also been delayed a bit. We're working with the [Indiscernible].  We feel we're on a common schedule now. We've got some significant supply chain issues that we've had to embed our own engineers into our suppliers to try to get them to perform. We're counting on them. That's important. But it's not going to deter or defer us from our goal of really developing the F-35 platform to be the aeronautics cornerstone of our architecture for 21st century warfare.  Because yes, once TR-3 is in, it will take another leapfrog up in data storage and data processing capabilities and networking capabilities which we will add. But we're already demonstrating how to do that with The hybrid base station that we actually flying a U-2 that provides that connectivity today with the Tech Refresh to equipment on the jet. So these things are related but not directed a differential or coterminous, they aren't be coterminous. We will get both of these jobs done, and the broadest program here, what we've -- I think derived by working with our government customers so far and understanding contracts and things is that, there won't be a overarching JADC2 of any kind.  What there will be is in reality in this business and I think in our customer construct, is that a technology roadmap and this has been developed more since maybe the last time you and I talked about this, Doug. But it's going to be a technology roadmap which is platform-by-platform connectivity using an open architecture set of standards and protocols that the whole industry can share. And we're going to be doing that one stage at a time. And what I want to do and I have been talking to our customers about at the most senior level is to provide every six to 12 months a mission capability by implementing this technology roadmap mission by mission.  Now we've got 14 missions and we've got 14 technologies coincidentally that we have completed three of those missions, which happened to be counterair, surface warfare, and integrated air and missile defense. We're showing customers those road maps and getting feedback on what platforms we should be tying together first, and getting those sensors, the decision making, command and control systems, and actual effectors connected in the most optimal way every 6-12 months. So we're moving out on both fronts [Indiscernible] is, again, associated, but not essential for moving out on the 21st Century Warfare Front.
Greg Gardner: Okay. Thank you, John. I think we've got a little over our normal time, but there's been outstanding conversation today. I think at this time, I'll turn it over to Jim for some closing remarks.
James Taiclet: Sure, Greg. As I conclude the call today, I want to end by reinforcing our commitment to delivering long-term value to our shareholders here. While using our strong cash flow and robust Balance Sheet to do so, we're not shy about leverage, we're not shy about moving out with speed and with scale as we've talked about. Similarly, and again, along the way, we are going to work hard and invest to advance our customers important missions along the way. Those numbers are gone through around to 2 billion of CapEx and 1.5 billion of [inaudible 01:13:15] They're not incremental, they are up from our recent history, but they are not at an incremental 2 billion and incremental 1.5 billion just to be clear on that.  So I just want to make sure everybody knows our approach here. We're going to be positioning ourselves for growth inflection that we hope and expect to see a couple of years down the road. And by doing the share repurchase at the scale we're discussing in the timeframe we're looking at. The for sure valuation -- a value of that growth inflection should be amplified. That's our goal here. And thanks again for all of you for joining us on this call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in January. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-26 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

James Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I will begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on our financial results, which Ken will elaborate on in a few minutes. Our second quarter sales increased 5% over last year's second quarter as each business area exceeded 2020 levels led by our Space team. Our Space business grew over 10% this quarter due to growth in hypersonics, Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR satellite activities, and increased support provided to the U.K Ministry of Defense's Atomic Weapons Establishment program, which will close out our management of that activity. Our segment operating profit was impacted this quarter by a one-time charge associated with a classified program in our Aeronautics business area. While the classified nature of this program precludes us from discussing this matter in depth, we can say that our customer is highly attracted to the capabilities that we’re developing on their behalf that we're committed to delivering these capabilities and that the long-term potential of this solution is significant for the company. Our cash generation remains strong, driving $1.3 billion of cash from operations this quarter after making $1.4 billion of accelerated payments to our supply base as we continue to mitigate the risks brought on by COVID-19 for our supply chain. Our cash generation and the strength of our balance sheet gave us the ability to complete a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter, in addition to the $1 billion ASR executed last quarter, thereby bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $1.5 billion. We remain confident in our ability to continue driving strong cash generation and supporting balanced cash deployment actions, including investing in key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to shareholders. Turning to budgets, the White House submitted their fiscal year 2022 budget proposal to Congress requesting $715 billion for the Department of Defense, an $11 billion increase from the FY '21 enacted budget. Our programs continue to be well supported, including over $12 billion for the F-35 program, approximately $3.5 billion for our signature Sikorsky helicopters, and over $2 billion for hypersonics programs. The President's budget request prioritizes funding for innovation and modernization as well, in recognition of the need to invest in technologies and capabilities to address the great power competition the nation now faces. These include areas of strength within the Lockheed Martin portfolio such as continued support for Air and Missile Defense programs, THAAD, PAC-3, and our recent next-generation interceptor award; space domain initiatives including OPIR, and GPS III satellites, and the space development agency's Transport Layer Architecture. The Defense Department request also focused on investments in advanced capability enablers. We believe this vision of deterrence and innovation is well aligned with our broad portfolio in our 21st Century Warfare vision. In Congressional March to-date of the FY '22 defense budget request, we continue to see strong support from the hill for all of our programs, which include increases for F-35, C-130, CH-53K, and UH-60 programs and fully approved budget requests for many of our other systems. Turning to some strategic and operational achievements in this quarter, I'd like to begin by highlighting the company's participation in Northern Edge 21, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command exercise in support of the Pacific deterrence initiative. This live exercise included multiple U.S military services across a very wide geographic area, with a goal of enhancing joint interoperability between the services and the various domains that they operate in. Signature programs from all four of our business areas participated in this event, and we successfully demonstrated joint all-domain command and control known as JADC2. We demonstrated capabilities such as enhanced situational awareness by integrating sensors across land, sea, air, and space, for example. Among our successful demonstrations during -- of JADC2 during the exercise was one, enabling Aegis and PAC-3 MSE integration for an integrated air and missile defense against advanced threats; also using the F-35 to provide real-time tracking and targeting data generated near San Diego during a flight to the All Domain Operations Center in Alaska for prosecution and fire control; also facilitating space-based connectivity at the same time, using the MUOS narrowband satellite communications constellation; and also supporting the Air National Guard's demonstration of a new data link capability with our Legion Pod, which integrates our infrared search and track targeting sensor technology into that broader network. The Northern Edge exercise demonstrated our integrated offensive and defensive fires capability, our satellite communication links, as well as the ability to adapt joint battle management concepts in real time. One of my goals in the first year as CEO of Lockheed Martin was to actually demonstrate the benefits of network effects to our customers using existing platforms under our 21st century warfare concept. Our integrated performance in Northern Edge did exactly that, and we're just getting started. Moving to some specific business area highlights. In Aeronautics, Switzerland's Federal Council announced its decision to purchase 36 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing or CTOL aircraft, along with sustainment and training services as part of their Air2030 modernization program. This is a significant win for Lockheed Martin with an initial value of $5.5 billion and a total value of approximately $15 billion over 30 years. The F-35 was selected over the F-18, the Rafale, and the Eurofighter because of its survivability, information superiority, and comprehensively network systems. The Swiss Council also noted that the F-35 delivered outstanding value offering both the lowest procurement and operational costs across all those competing aircrafts. Switzerland will become the 15th nation to join the program since its inception, and we're excited to welcome them into the F-35 community. In Rotary and Mission systems, the U.S Navy awarded our Sikorsky team a contract for nine CH-53K heavy lift helicopters for production Lot 5, which is worth nearly $900 million, and we're continuing to drive cost down and provide reduced unit prices to our customer. The award also included the option for nine additional King Stallion aircraft for Lot 6, which when those are exercised would represent over $1.9 billion in order for the Lot 5 and 6 combined. Including the previous Lot 5 award we received, orders for 33 53K's out of a Navy program record of 200. So, a long way to go over 80% of domestic aircraft quantities are still in front of us, and interest from international customers is driving additional opportunities. Also in RMS, our C6ISR team participated in a unique collaboration with the Air Force to integrate critical battle management capabilities from our command and control legacy product, The Theater Battle Management Control System or TBMCS into the Air Force's new Kessel Run All Domain Operations Suite. The TBMSC -- TBMCS was first declared a system of record in 2000 and performs the planning and execution of air missions, interfacing with many other operations, intelligence, and C2 systems throughout the U.S armed services. Our RMS team delivered a cloud-based architecture and delivery plan to enhance capabilities and migrate TBMCS data into the Kessel Run operation suite in support of pilots and commanders executing joint air campaigns. So another example of our 21st century work fair concept and action with our Air Force customer in this case. In Missiles and Fire Control, our integrated Air and Missile Defense line of business delivered the first PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement or MSE interceptors to Sweden, providing a country with the world's most advanced air defense capabilities to defend against incoming threats. Sweden now becomes one of 10 international customers to choose PAC-3 MSE missiles. In addition, our Space business area successfully launched two new satellites in support of critical national security space objectives. Our fifth Space Based Infrared System and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit or SBIRS GEO-5 satellite successfully deployed from its United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket and is now communicating with the operations team from the U.S space force. SBIRS GEO-5 is the latest satellite to join the space forces orbiting early warning missile constellation and its equipped with powerful surveillance sensors to support ballistic missile defense, and expand technical intelligence gathering and bolster situational awareness for the guardians that are defending the U.S and its allies. The SBIRS GEO-5 satellite is the first military satellite built on an LM 2100 Combat Bus. That's a more resilient, modernized and modular space vehicle originally developed using Lockheed Martin internal investment. Also the fifth Global Positioning System or GPS III satellite was also successfully launched this quarter. The GPS III Space Vehicle 5 is the 31st operational GPS satellite in the constellation with significant advancements over previous GPS Space Vehicles, including three times better accuracy and improved anti-jamming capabilities. The GPS III and OPIR satellite constellations are both Lockheed Martin's signature programs and represent key elements of our network centric 21st century warfare concept. And lastly, our space business area was selected by NASA to build spacecraft for two separate missions to Venus. Lockheed Martin will design, build and operate the VERITAS orbiter to investigate the surface and subsurface of Venus, and the DAVINCI+ vehicle to research the planet's atmosphere. These missions build on our legacy Magellan program for the exploration of Venus and will represent NASA's first return to the planet in more than three decades. These achievements from across the company highlight our focus on providing innovative solutions, and the strength that our broad portfolio gives us to support our customers missions and their all domain objectives. I'll close my remarks today with a quick status on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced last December, a transaction that we believe will enhance Lockheed Martin's as well as all of industry's ability to meet our future national security and civil space objectives when it comes to propulsion. We are committed to achieving the key DoD priorities of reducing cost, increasing the quality and speed of new products, in addition to enhancing Aerojet Rocketdyne's position as a leading merchant supplier to all of industry. We remain in the process of responding to the Federal Trade Commission's second request for information, which we received earlier in the year, a step in the review process that we'd expected. We continue to engage with the FTC and Department of Defense stakeholders regularly as part of their review, and pending approval, we hope to -- and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken.
Ken Possenriede: Hey, thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts that we have included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3, and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw solid growth in sales and earnings per share. Segment operating profit was comparable to last year's second quarter total due to the $225 million impact of a classified aeronautics program, while cash from operations was $1.3 billion exceeding our expectations for the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, cash return to shareholders exceeded 100% of free cash flow as we executed another $500 million of share repurchases in addition to $721 million of dividends paid. Despite the issue of a single contract, we were able to increase our outlook for earnings per share and hold our full year outlook for all other key financial metrics. Turning to Chart 4, we compare ourselves and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Second quarter sales grew 5% compared with 2020 to $17 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit remains at approximately $1.8 billion comparable to last year's results. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the second quarter of 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.52 was $0.73 above our results last year driven by volume, reduced share count and higher FAS/CAS income. On Chart 6, we will look at our cash generation and distributions for the second quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was $950 million. By executing additional share repurchases of $500 million in the second quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to generate -- excuse me, we're able to return 129% of free cash flow to our stockholders this quarter. Moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for earnings per share and holding our outlook for sales segment operating profit and cash from operations. Looking at Chart 8, we are increasing the sales outlook for RMS by $150 million. And that's primarily driven by volume at Sikorsky as well as a $25 million increase at our space business area and combined offset the downward adjustment in aeronautics, keeping total sales consistent with our prior guidance. In our Chart 9, we show the increased segment operating profit range for RMS, Missiles and Fire Control and Space, also offsetting the impact realized at Aeronautics, which allowed us to hold our guidance for the year, and we will continue to pursue cost takeout and margin improvement opportunities across the corporation On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our update to the guidance for 2021 earnings per share. Program performance and continued cost takeout offset our impact at Aeronautics, and we also saw improvements to earnings per share from investments and other non-operational items, along with the benefit of our continued share repurchases. To conclude on Chart 11, we have our summary. We continue to see sales growth year-over-year as well as strong operational cash performance, while still accelerating cash to our supply chain to meet commitments vital to our national security. And, as noted, we have increased our full outlook for earnings per share and are holding all other key metrics as we look ahead to the second half of 2021. And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first with the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
Douglas Harned: Jim, I wanted to see if you could describe some of the things that would likely drive growth at Lockheed Martin. You talked some about the budget, but we're now in a fairly flat budget environment and Lockheed Martin's revenues have moved higher, but the backlog has really not grown during the last 18 months, as some legacy programs have naturally flattened. You highlighted some good growth areas like hypersonics and Space. But when you look at the next 5 years, do you believe you can get the mid-single-digit, say top line growth in this environment, particularly given flat recent backlogs. I mean basically what should we look for that could take backlogs higher and drive enough growth to offset potential declines in mature programs?
James Taiclet: Good morning, Doug. With the resurgence of great power competition with China and Russia, the defense enterprise overall is at an inflection point. And when I say defense enterprise, I mean government, military, and industry. It needs to change. And where I think I can address your question is during that period of change, and it's very important and critical that we started now that Lockheed Martin is in a position with its breadth of platforms and systems and its cutting edge technology to both drive and benefit from that needed change. And so, yes, over the next 5 years, we're going to strive for mid-single-digit growth, and I'm energized and enthusiastic about working with our government military leaders, which we've already started. And with our defense sector and telecom and technology sectors, partners that we're going to have in the future to do this. And I'm convinced that our shareholders are going to benefit from our leadership here. We're going to benefit in a couple ways, and one of them is going to be by enhancing the value of our legacy programs, including the obvious F-35 is a much valuable, more valuable platform when you take advantage of the network effect that it can deliver by connecting sensors across domains, adding 5G.mil capability to our comm system so that we can communicate with satellites directly, etcetera, you end up getting a whole network effect with a value to the defense enterprise and the deterrent value is going to go up by implementing this across our technology roadmap over the next number of years, our existing systems. So, I'm very energized about the growth prospect. I think we have a uniquely positioned capability to drive it and that we've got a unique capability to interact with commercial industry in a whole number of sectors to help it happen.
Douglas Harned: If I can follow-up on that, when you talk about the inflection point, is this something that we should be looking for with respect to what Congress is doing, what the administration is doing or is it already embedded in the budget because the budget doesn't seem to set up for a lot of growth as it stands right now.
James Taiclet: The inflection point of need is here, Doug, but the system we will work within does not move abruptly, let's say. So it's got to migrate over a period of time in its way, if you will, and Congress will have a part in that. It's going to be a little bit more deliberate as far as the budget turns out. But within that budget, we intend to make our products, platforms, and services the leading edge and therefore the most attractive ways to allocate that budget in all the domains that we serve. So, we're actually not expecting our 21st century warfare concept to get funded independently. Rather, we're going to use that to make our current and future platforms way more competitive, way more attractive, use a network effect to get more value for money for the government and see how the budget can shift our way, depending on -- and in fact, irrespective of how much the top line grows. Let me ask Ken to follow-up on that.
Ken Possenriede: Hey, Doug, if I could, I will give -- I will just give you a little more color that'll hopefully complement what Jim said. So, if you think about our portfolio and where we are and where we're going, so F-35, rough numbers 27%, 28% of our portfolio and you think about where we are and where we're going with that program. So we're right now for production in the midst of our product -- what's called a production rebaseline. And that's basically due to COVID and trying to get our technology Refresh 3 on Lot 15 and Block 4 onto Lot 16. The customer -- the joint program office is working with all the key constituents to look at what makes sense. As you recall, this year we're going to deliver anywhere from 133 to 139 aircraft. What makes sense next year and into the next couple years to make sure we maximize when we put that key technology on that aircraft. So, you're going to likely see once that gets revealed, and hopefully it'll be -- we'll be able to reveal that with the customer when we give trend data in October, but it's likely to show the plateau of production slightly pushed out to the right but also elongating, if you will. So I think at least in the next couple of years, there is likely some opportunity there from a production standpoint. There is definitely opportunity for us in sustainment if you think about it, only roughly 40%, 50% of the bases are stood up. So, we still have a lot of work to do there. We're also going to have many more aircraft in the fleet in the next couple of years. Think of in the next couple of years, we're going to have over 1,000 aircraft in the fleet which are going to require more sparing, that modernization I just talked about working with the customer, we're also going to have to modernize some aircraft to put this new technology on aircraft that are already in the fleet. So that's one area. Sticking with that -- excuse me, sticking with Aeronautics, you have F-16 which is an international play that we have a backlog of 128 aircraft that is going to continue to grow top line as will Skunk Works. That's going to become a larger part of the Aeronautics platform. And just sticking internationally, we see strong demand for our integrated Air Missile Defense products. If you look at our helicopter programs, we're just starting to deliver CH-53 aircraft program, a record of 200 plus to the Israelis, hopefully, it'll be a couple other countries that have an interest in that platform. And then there's future vertical lift, which will give us a huge uplift in the middle of this decade going forward when we win those programs. And then there's Space. You mentioned hypersonics, that is going to be a nice complimentary part of that portfolio. I agree, it's not going to dramatically move the needle, but you're going to have those programs go into production in the middle of this decade, which will give us some uplift and then National Security Space, whether it's classified OPIR, NGI, we'll see some strong growth there. So we feel pretty good. Complementing what Jim said, we feel pretty good about our prospects going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much and good overall quarter, given the classified issue. So you did a -- an ASR in the quarter. And then you had this classified adjustment. Did you know at the time, you did the ASR, this would happen? Because I would have thought, if you saw it coming, you would have waited to do the ASR.
Ken Possenriede: Hey, Cai. Good morning. Good to talk to you. This is Ken. I will take that. So if you think about when we did the ASR, we basically put that in place the day after, we were allowed to trade again, which would have been a day after earnings. And as I mentioned before, if you look at the large amount of cash that we have, our thought back then and it still remains today, we continue to have that cash on our balance sheet. And we believe we're going to continue to have that after Aerojet Rocketdyne, we're going to remain in the market. That was our thought process in April, when we did the $500 million ASR. We're highly likely based on where our stock price is trading today. We're going to enter the market again as soon as we're able to -- may not be an ASR, but we're going to go into the open market and buy back more stock, it just absolutely makes sense to do that. Regarding when we knew about the charge, that basically happened in the May time period. It became clear, based off from a process standpoint, Cai, we had a joint customer, Lockheed Martin review to do a deep dive on the program. And then we also did one, that was Lockheed Martin only to provide an additional assurance function. So we've done a very thorough assessment of the situation and that was done in the May time period. And in fact, in the June time period, we reported out to our Board, so Jim, myself, and Frank St. John, our COO, reported out to the Board and we also had what's called a classified business and security committee meeting, and we actually owe them a comeback in September. So that all initiated in May, we're very comfortable with the charge. Just to give a little bit of a flavor of that $225 million, that is for the development portion of this program. Think of that as roughly 40% of that cost has already occurred and the other 60% is embedded in the new estimate to complete. So we're not assuming that this program goes forward with the current the -- excuse me, the prior ETC. It is a new estimate to complete with that over on embedded. So we think we have a good handle on that. And from a timing standpoint, it was after the ASR was put in place.
Operator: Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everybody.
James Taiclet: Good morning, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Ken, maybe you can just -- I know it's classified and you said there's only so much detail you can provide. But any incremental color you could give on what exactly happened, where the performance -- what type of performance issue it is? And you're -- how you're confident, it doesn't linger. And then, just folding that into the total Aeronautics segment margin, the revised annual segment EBIT guidance for the segment implies that margin picks right back up, even to above where it was pre 2Q. How do you do that with the reset number on this program plus I think you mentioned in the release F-35 margin didn't go up. So any color you can provide on where the segments margin goes from here?
Ken Possenriede: You bet. So, yes, let's first talk about the classified program. And I'll assure you know, and for everybody on the call, what we are able to say we've got approval from the customer. And hopefully, I've given you guys enough experience where I'll be as transparent as I can. But on this there's only so much we could say. So, as I answered to Cai's question, no, we've done a lot of independent reviews. We've done reviews with the customer. We think today based on all the information we have, it's a development contract that we believe will be successful from a schedule and performance standpoint, and then ultimately will turn into production -- a production program. And we also believe there are additional opportunities out there. And I'll assure you, we believe, I could say this, that there is still a very strong business case, given these associated opportunity. So this will be a great program for our customers. And I'm talking about all the customers out there that are going to utilize this and it'll be a good program for the Lockheed Martin Corporation. Regarding Aeronautics, Noah, you've got it right. For the second half of the year, we're basically assuming a little bit over 11% return on sales. And think of that as it's got to be primarily F-35. It will be -- from that standpoint, we are assuming some risk retirement on some production programs. I have mentioned in the past on the Block 5 we have taken a pause on risk retirements until we see improved performance there probably next year. But there are other lots out there. Back to the comments we made about our cost takeout initiatives, cost competitive niches, and our strong performance in other parts of the portfolio. We believe F-35 production, there's other opportunities out there for us to have risk retirements. F-16, we'll also see some improvement as we'll see 130. So I think you got that right. Aeronautics, we feel comfortable being around 11% or a little bit above 11% return on sales for the second half of the year.
Operator: And next we'll go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: Hi, good morning, Jim. Good morning, Ken.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Hi.
Kristine Liwag: Maybe switching gears, directed energy has been one of the key areas of advanced capabilities that the DoD has highlighted as an important category. How meaningful is it that the Navy is fielding the HELIOS and the DDG 51 Arleigh Burke? How much of a contributor could this be to long-term top line growth maybe in the next 5 years? And also, how far away are we until we see miniaturization of this kind of technology where you could deploy it on a platform like the F-35?
Ken Possenriede: So -- hey, Kristine, it's Ken. I'll take that one. So, yes, we are in the thick of that with the contracts that you described. And we're very pleased with the performance we've had on these programs. And we're also pleased where we think the customers going. I think we'll see a dramatic increase with our involvement, but you have to put that in perspective relative to the size of what it is. But it will be accretive from a top line standpoint. It's just for a $68 billion company that will continue to grow, at least in the next 5 years. Kristine, it's not going to be a -- I'd say, a material impact. In terms of miniaturization, we're working that with the customer. I think based on what we've seen, we're some ways away from that though. But we will give you an update when there is one to give.
Operator: And next we'll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Ken, it might be another one for you. Can you talk about the second half trends implied on cash flow to get to that $8.9 billion -- greater than $8.9 billion, obviously that would imply materially better than you've ever done in the second half. And then similarly, if you can just color the backlog, is it -- do you have confidence you can get back to that 147, 150 level is the F-35 progressing such that those will actually close this year. Just color on those two things. Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: You're right. So Myles, we've done for the first half of the year a little over $3 billion, which would tell you we've -- we need to do $6.9 billion. And based on what I'm seeing the lion share of that -- I'm not giving you much comfort, but once I finish, I will hopefully the lion share of that $6.9 billion is in the fourth quarter. And really the driver there is we're in the midst and a lot of this is due to COVID. We're in the midst of renegotiating, if you will, the timing and the amounts of performance based payments on the F-35 program that's specifically Block 5. We're working through that now. And if you look at January 1 to the end of the second quarter, rough numbers, our contract assets grew by roughly $1.9 billion. The lion share of that is F-35 and the lion share of that is performance-based payments; timing, if you will, of when we liquidate that for F-35. We believe we're on a path with the customer to close on that. This is the third quarter to close it -- close on that in the third quarter. And just to give you a little more color, we think -- excuse me, we think contract assets are going to grow another $500 million in the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter and most of that will be before December to give you some comfort, we will be liquidating contract assets to the point where we only see contract assets growing in total by an immaterial amount, they will still come down quite a bit and that's driven by the fourth quarter. And most of that is driven by Aeronautics. There is some work that needs to be done from a cash collection standpoint at RMS as well. But the lion share of that is Aeronautics. And we feel really bullish miles about the $8.9 billion of cash from ops for this year. In terms of backlog, I think we've already stated that. So you've got Lot 15, that we thought for F-35 that we thought would settle last year. We believe it's now going to settle this year. There's just a lot of complications going on and we think the joint program office working with all the constituents, it has a very difficult job, but they're doing a really great job of coordinating what the demands and the needs are of the services plus the international customers. We think that'll close in the third quarter. But because of that we have little to no comfort that Lot 16 is going to close this year. So we're actually out looking that to close next year. And that that's a sizable order. It's just timing, which means right now we're forecasting backlog to end this year at about $143 billion. So we're actually going to erode backlog this year. But again, I'll stress that's all timing. And for Lockheed Martin, we've gotten enough advanced funding on those Lots for 15 and 16, where it is not an impact to us. It'll just be optically a reduction in backlog.
Operator: Our next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yes. Good morning, Jim and Ken.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
Peter Arment: Hey Jim question, I guess on sticking on F-35, maybe can you touch upon just maybe the investments that Lockheed is making to reduce sort of the lifecycle costs of F-35 and do you expect to increase any of your internal spending, just given the sustainment discussion continues to grow louder, and I guess in front of your potential, PBL contract with the Air Force? And maybe, Ken, if you could just touch upon when you think that PBL contract could come into play as well?
James Taiclet: Sure. We've spent about $500 million to date in investments to improve the sustainability cause of the F-35 there, Peter. And we'll continue to make reasonable investments as we go forward. But there's a perspective that I can give you from a former Air Force pilot, because operationally and on the line, where the pilots and the commanders are flying the jets and defending the country and doing the missions, there's actually a lot of good things happening, and they'll tell you this themselves. But first of all, you can go to the performance metrics, meaning that flight hour between failure metric, when can you expect to fly the jet before you've got to get a spare airplane that day. It's nearly double the contractual requirement. And so the pilots when they get an assignment from the tail number for a mission, on any given day, they're twice as likely to get in that airplane and fly the mission as they are in any other fourth gen plane. On top of that, it's about twice as reliable as a fourth generation fighter. And meanwhile, the labor hours of maintenance needed for each of those flight hours is about two-thirds of the contractual requirements. So if you get out to bases, and talk to commanders who have either in their wings, F-35s and other aircraft, or they've commanded different squadrons of different types of aircraft, they'll tell you that for the frontline performance in the area of operations, if you will, the F-35 is sort of head and shoulders above legacy aircraft. In fact, the Air Force had about 18 months in CENTCOM recently, where they just got back from that tour, if you will. They had 1,300 sorties with F-35s, and the mission capable rate was all -- it was nearly 75%, sometimes 80% to 90%, any given week. And that's really, really strong, haven't been out and done this before, I can tell you that that's top shelf. Now, on the other hand, the affordability we need to address and I've met with each of the service chiefs and the chairman to implore all of us to work together on this. Lockheed Martin with that $500 million investment over the last few years has taken about 40% of the cost that we can control out of our purview, if you will. Already, we're going to shoot for another 40% over the next 5 years, but somehow 40% keeps coming up. We're only about 40% of the total cost. So 60% is propulsion and military government cost. If we don't have an all-in strategy together to address this we are not going to hit the goals. And so, again, when I meet with the chiefs and the chairman, and hopefully soon with the service chiefs, we will all get together on a tiger team and address this in the only way it can be successfully addressed as an integrated team. So that's how we're going to approach it. I do agree with the team at Aeronautics that there is a way to get this cost per flying hour on an A model of 25,000 an hour, but it's got to be an all-in approach. And we're going to keep doing our part, of course. But we’re -- I'm personally involved in trying to pull the wider team together to get that done.
Ken Possenriede: So, Peter, just based on timing, based on what Jim just said, we are starting to see a lot of interest. If you recall, we issued a white paper that described how we would drive down the costs, we described how industry would sign up to service level agreements. And as Jim mentioned, we are making great progress with the energy industry consortium. And we do think we have Pratt Whitney from a propulsion standpoint and the services fully engaged now. And we believe we're going to soon be responding to an RFP. They're going to take a lot of the key pieces out of our white paper for us then to what I'll call answer a conventional request for proposal. And we're hopeful that early next year, we industry could be under contract for some type of performance based logistics concept. And I'll just remind you that this is likely not going to be a top line enhancement play for us. That that's probably all embedded. But assuming the industry is incentivized to hit these targets or to over achieve these targets, it could potentially be a return on sales play for us.
Operator: Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
David Strauss: The -- in the fiscal '22 budget, the next-gen air dominance program saw a nice plus up. Can you talk about the role you're playing on that program, whether that work is all classified at this point, or not? And then, I guess, Ken, could you also touch on the R&D tax amortization issue, where that stands? Is there been any movement potentially done to do that? Thanks.
James Taiclet: Sure. I'll take both. Yes, unfortunately, David, NGAD, everything about NGAD is classified. The only thing I will say is you've heard the customers, the DoD say that F-35 is not going to be a build pair of NGAD. And I still think that's still the answer out there which is good news for the -- our great fifth gen aircraft. But unfortunately everything else regarding NGAD is classified and we can't discuss what our role or not our role is. Regarding the amortization of R&D, we're still working with a lot of our constituents. When we come out with trend data in October, David, our tax experts are telling us unfortunately at that time, it's likely not to be settled. So it is likely we will offer trend data for '22. That would -- right now what we see is assuming this issue goes away or gets deferred and does not impact '22 cash, we see $9 billion or greater of cash from operations next year. So we're in the midst of going through our long range plan. So hopefully we'll be able to reaffirm that. But we're also -- then also going to have to state that right now what we see is this amortization issue was a $2.1 billion impact to cash in '22. We're hopeful that this thing either gets deferred out 5 years, that's one scenario we're hearing. I mean, what we'll see where it goes, or it gets repealed, or it is interpreted differently than the way we industry are interpreting. And it really is just what I'll call conventional independent research and development for us, which would be rough numbers, a $300 million impact rather than a $2.1 billion impact. But regardless, Lockheed Martin sees a path forward for us to continue generating strong cash this year and into the next couple years. And we'll use that for our internal and organic inorganic investments for our employees, and then give a fair amount back to our shareholders.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Hey, good morning.
James Taiclet: Hey.
Robert Spingarn: Jim, when I listened to DoD, I hear them talk a lot about open architecture solutions and finding ways to be less locked into the contractors. But in listening to your answer to Doug's question before you spoke a fair amount about network effects, which some might view as another form of locking. So can you talk a bit about that tension, whether you think it's there. And if so, how Lockheed resolves to deliver both the vision that you've articulated, while also meeting DoD's broader desires?
James Taiclet: Sure. Rob, the two things are completely compatible and my recent experience has been that telecom and tech industry where it was essential that open architecture be the baseline, or the foundation, if you will, for 4G and 5G network development in telecom, for example. So our approach is completely based on open architecture. We even have a product we call open radio architecture that we demonstrated in a U-2, Lockheed U-2, of course, as basically a cell tower in the sky connecting F-35 and F-22 data links to again, the open radio architecture. And we could add an F-18, or another aircraft, even an allied aircraft, a Eurofighter, for example, down the road. The whole point of this is you want to build the network effect as broadly as you can across, frankly, all the platforms out there eventually. But we're building a roadmap internally in the Lockheed Martin because this -- these are the products and platforms we can control to install, trial, demonstrate and then produce these in our products. At the same time, like I said earlier, we're open to collaborating with our industry partners that are traditional in Defense and Aerospace, and eagerly and already successfully with some of my old counterparts and my former counterparts, I should say, in telecom and tech where we're trying to build out the Internet of Things network of the future here. So this is something where you can and must have an open architecture at the vendor lock, so to speak, will diminish. But this is a matter of leadership and speed and performance. And that's where Lockheed Martin can, I think, take a great position going forward here.
Operator: Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Jim and Ken.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe I was wondering if you could just update us on the classified business in general, how big is it across the businesses? How do you quantify risk versus rest of the segment -- rest of the business? And maybe, where are you seeing the most opportunities?
James Taiclet: Sure. Hey, Sheila, good morning. I'll take that. So, yes, generally speaking, our customers frown upon us from talking about the size of classified, but if you think about it, Aeronautics and Space would have the largest classified business in our portfolio. Third would be missiles and fire control, and then fourth, but last but not least, I'll stress is RMS. We see a lot of opportunities in Space. And that has not been something that's recent, but it seems to be trending up in an accelerated way. And also in Aeronautics, we've talked about this unfortunate missed charge on this program that we have today. As I stress when asked earlier, we do believe this thing has a very strong business case going forward, which will continue to grow. There's also other programs in the Aeronautics portfolio that will continue to grow. Missiles and Fire Control, we've talked about the classified program we won that requires some capital that is still in development and in the not too distant future that also will go into production. So we see the classified portion of Lockheed Martin growing faster than the non-classified portion of Lockheed Martin. Regarding how we run classified versus non-classified, that's a timely question because the -- recall when I answered the question about our classified business and Security Committee of our Board, that is one thing that we do go demonstrate to them that the processes that we have in the white world are identical to the processes that we try to put in the black world, and we also have the -- internal audit. Organization is part of that and we just reaffirm that and our external auditors, E&Y, are also instrumental and part of that. So the key is we try to mirror what we're doing in the non-classified from a process standpoint into the classified world.
Operator: Next we'll go to Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Hey, thanks. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.
James Taiclet: Good morning, Seth.
Seth Seifman: Ken, I was -- good morning. Ken, I was wondering, we've talked a little in the past about the F-35 production revenue outlook and you mentioned the rebaselining earlier. If we think about F-35 production sales this year probably being in the, let's say, the mid $13 billion range. As you think about this rebaselining, where does that head into 2022? And then, how would it eventually get up to that plateau, which I assume is something in the range of 170 times the price per aircraft of -- for the three variants. I don't know, maybe it's $90 million on average or something like that. But specifically for next year, how does the rebaselining affect your production revenue expectations?
Ken Possenriede: Yes. Thanks, Seth, and good morning to you. Yes, so we're still -- as I said earlier, we're still working through that rebaseline with the Joint Program Office who think of that as the quarterback, the program manager dealing with the services and the international customers. So all I could say today is our base plan was 169 aircraft. It is highly likely we are going to deliver less aircraft next year than 169. I just don't know what that is. And the only other thing I could say, and I don't mean to make this sound like Yogi Berra, but it's likely going to be less than what it would have been. I'm not suggesting it'll be less than this year, but it'll be less than -- the forecasted 169 and you're spot on, Seth. This rebase line may take 2, 3 years. And again, that's something else we'll get from the customer and the plateau will ultimately be 170 aircraft, perhaps a little bit more. And that plateau then will extend out farther out into the future than what we thought. And back to Jim's opening comments, we were just notified we won in Switzerland. That is a big, big deal for us. We just put in our best and final offer in for Finland. We're in the hunt for the next generation fighter aircraft in Canada. There are many other customers that have an interest in this aircraft including this -- of course, the services of the United States. So we think there is a strong demand out there for this aircraft. Regarding price -- regarding the B variant and the C variant, just based on quantities, it's likely you'll see the price of that aircraft either stay where it is or continue to come down the learning curve. The A variant, and I'm not trying to negotiate with the customer on the phone, but due to where we are in learning, due to where we are with inflation and due to where we are with the added capabilities that they want on the aircraft, it is likely you'll see an increase in prices, a modest increase in prices of where we are today. You got to factor all that in. We should have a better answer for you in the October time period in terms of what the impact is.
Operator: And next we'll go to Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good morning. Ken, can you just talk about kind of how much of the portfolio maybe arrows specifically is related to sustainment? And are you seeing any pressure there? Is there been any shift in focus from -- less of a focus on readiness, more on modernization under this administration? And then just on your comment on the F-35 Block 5 margins, is that just related to the technology insertion? Or are there kind of other challenges you're facing just on pausing risk retirements on F-35? Thank you.
Ken Possenriede: You bet, Joe. Good morning. So on sustainment, think of sustainment, there is sustainment in F-35, which back to the comments Jim made and then I made earlier, we still see strong demand. Well, of course, we want to get the cost per flight hour down. We also want to ensure that there's available aircraft out there, but the demand is going to grow there. And there is a keen desire for the more fielded aircraft that we have out there, the more robust sustainment program we have. We also have sustainment -- think of sustainment on F-22. I mean, eventually F-22s are going to get sunset, but I would say in the foreseeable future think of F-22 sales not being quite, say, a $1 billion -- they're over a $1 billion. And going forward, you may see that decline just a little bit. F-16, a big portion of F-16 is sustainment for international customers. And I believe we've mentioned this in the not too distant past. We actually got a contract with the United States Air Force to sustain their aircraft. And it's been quite a while since we've gotten a current contract for that. So I don't see that demand going away or the interest going away either. C-130, a big piece of that is sustainment of aircraft internationally. And then, in our Skunk Works, think of the U-2 is a sustainment contract, and ultimately they'll get sunsetted as well, but not in the -- not too distant future. And your second question was on Block 5 margins. Yes, it's right now, Joe, we're seeing -- we're taking a pause because what we agree to in negotiations from a learning curve standpoint coming down a learning curve, we're still coming down the learning curve from a -- this is costs now, down the learning curve not as robust as we planned to take these risks retirements. So we want to see continued performance into next year before we take those risks retirements at that time. And so think of Block 5 margins are very high, single-digit margins. These risk retirements would take them up into the low double-digit margins, but we'll likely keep pausing that until next year.
Greg Gardner: Hey, John, this is Greg. I think we've come up at the top of the hour. So I will turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.
James Taiclet: All right, Greg. Thanks. Look, I will just stand by reinforcing our commitments. First, our 21st Century Warfare vision, which will make our platforms and services more resilient and more attractive to the customer, in addition to making us more effective in creating a deterrent. Also investments and digital transformation and innovation, and delivering thereby strong cash generation supporting that afterwards that a strong dividend as we deliver long-term value to you all. And I want to just thank you again for joining us today. We're going to have an upcoming investor event in August. We hope you can join us for that. And John you can conclude the call then. Thank you everybody for being here this morning.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-20 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Possenriede, our Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.
James Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had a strong financial results this quarter, and continue to perform at a high level strategically and operationally. Our achievements reflect the quality of our workforce, the breadth of our products and services and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and stockholders. We continue to deliver these results in spite of the ongoing difficulties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. And my thanks go to the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their outstanding contributions during these challenging times. I'll begin today with a quick update on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced in December, a transaction we believe will enhance Lockheed Martin's ability to develop and supply advanced products in support of national security and our civil space objectives. We also plan to strengthen Aerojet Rocketdyne's capabilities as a merchant supplier with improved offerings for all of its industry and government customer, which is a critical component of closing our acquisition business case. Last month, Aerojet stockholders approved the merger agreement with over 99% of votes cast being in favor of the transaction. Also, this quarter, as expected, both companies received a request for additional information or a second request from the Federal Trade Commission as part of the regulatory review process. The second request extends the waiting period pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. We're working cooperatively with the FTC and continue to expect resolution of the regulatory review process by the latter part of 2021. Moving to our financial and operational results. Lockheed Martin got off to a strong start for the year. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide an update to our 2021 financial outlook, which increases key financial metrics across the board. But I'd like to continue by providing a few highlights right up front. First quarter sales increased 4% over the year-earlier period, with Rotary and Mission Systems growing 10% due to the delivery of an international pilot training system and ramping production of Sikorsky aircraft. Segment operating profit increased as a result of our sales performance, and earnings per share also saw strong growth. Our EPS benefited from gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. LM Ventures make strategic investments in early stage companies developing disruptive cutting-edge technologies, and it supports our technology road maps and growth strategies. Ken will give a little more color on this in a few moments. Our cash generation remains outstanding, driving over $1.7 billion of cash from operations this quarter, which includes the nearly $1.4 billion downward impact of accelerating payments to our suppliers, including thousands of small and vulnerable companies that are especially stressed due to COVID-19 impacts. Altogether, these results reflect the high level of execution being achieved across the company. Our outstanding cash generation and strong balance sheet also provide us the flexibility to complete a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter to opportunistically buy back stock. We expect our cash generation to remain strong, and we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions by investing in innovative technologies, executing our 21st century warfare strategy, providing our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to stockholders. Turning to federal budgets. As a reminder, the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle marked the final year of the Budget Control Act that was originally enacted in 2011. The Department of Defense appropriations approved as part of the FY 2021 omnibus funding bill resulted in a fully funded national defense budget of approximately $740 billion. The White House recently released their preliminary budget proposal for fiscal 2022, targeting approximate $11 billion top line increase for the Department of Defense, an indication of the desire for continued stability in national security funding, and in line with our expectations. Similarly, the President issued an interim national security strategic guidance document, which incorporates key elements such as diplomacy, economic development, innovation, and modernizing our military capabilities into a broad framework for addressing accelerating global challenges. This guidance document places emphasis on deterrence, investments in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and secure next gen 5G infrastructure as well as the need for having strong defense and intelligence capabilities. We believe this vision is well aligned with our 21st century warfare strategy and plays to the strength of our broad portfolio and our culture of innovation at Lockheed Martin. Also in the quarter, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package was enacted into legislation. This bill extended the CARES Act Section 3610 provision until September 30, 2021, enabling federal agencies to continue to reimburse contractors for the cost of keeping employees and subcontractors in a ready state as a result of the global pandemic. Importantly, this legislation also contained cash funding relief provisions affecting single employer pension plans, the primary reason for our increase in our cash outlook. Ken will discuss this further during his remarks. Turning to our business areas. I'd like to touch on several notable achievements demonstrating our focus on operational performance, strategic growth initiatives, and the strength of our portfolio. I'll begin with Aeronautics, where our team participated in this year's Orange Flag exercise. That's the U.S. Air Force's annual event to assess integration maturity of their war fighting platform. This year's Orange Flag featured a broad network-centric demonstration, showcasing the integration of the F-35 and other legacy aircraft, including the F-22 and U2, with long - land-based long-range fires, naval fires and space-based sensors. This exercise demonstrated a fully functional Internet of Things or IoT architecture, integrating a number of our nation's most advanced weapons systems. Our team was on the vanguard of this effort, enabling F-35s and F-22 to pass data to a U2, all Lockheed Martin aircraft, with the U2 then relaying the information to a ground-based control center. Targeting data was then transferred using machine-to-machine data sharing with an army engagement operations center as well as to navy ships. By providing data via fifth-generation aircraft to multiple command and control nodes, that information can be used for real-time targeting. This exercise demonstrated Lockheed Martin's readiness to provide unmatched situational awareness and to rapidly field capabilities today in support of our customers' joint all-domain operations concept.  In Rotary and Mission Systems, The CH-53K King Stallion was selected by the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the winner in their heavy lift helicopter competition. Upon contract award, our Sikorsky line of business will provide new CH-53Ks to replace the Israeli Air Force's current fleet of legacy Sikorsky 53-D aircraft. Israel will become the first international customer for our new 53-K variant, and we look forward to working with the Israeli Defense Force and the U.S. government to finalize the agreement. In our Missiles and Fire Control business area, the U.S. Army awarded our Precision Fires team a $2.8 billion contract for additional guided multiple launch rocket systems, or GMLRS, products and services that continue our relationships that's lasted for over 40 years. This quarter, MFC also delivered the 50,000 GMLR systems, another sign of the enduring demand of our signature programs. Moving to our space business area. The Missile Defense Agency down selected our space team for the next-generation interceptor program, awarding a $3.7 billion, five-year contract for technology development and risk reduction activities. This award leverages our internal investments and experience from our THAAD and other programs to deliver the capability to respond to multiple threats with a single interceptor. NGI will be a key element of homeland defense of our country against ballistic nuclear missiles, and we're extremely proud to be selected to pursue this opportunity. Our Space team also announced a strategic interest agreement with telecommunications firm omni space to explore collaborating on a hybrid communications network using both satellites and ground-based wireless technology. Tying together space and terrestrial systems into a seamless 5G network, has the potential to greatly enhance military applications and help manage complex information-centric warfare and all the operational domains. We continue to explore opportunities like this one with the goal of accelerating the benefits of commercial telecommunications technology into our 5G.mil initiative to rapidly increase the capabilities of our soldiers, sailors and airmen in the 21st century. I'll close by again highlighting Our space team and their contribution to the recent successful Mars Perseverance landing. Lockheed Martin Space designed and built the Mars 2020 Aero Shell, which encapsulated both the Perseverance Rover and the innovative Ingenuity drone helicopter, protecting them during entry and decent through the Martian atmosphere. Lockheed Martin also designed and built the Mars helicopter delivery system, which transported Ingenuity on the Rover and successfully deployed the helicopter for its historic first flights on Mars. We've built aeroshell systems for every one of NASA's Mars Rovers and Landers, and we've been part of every NASA Mars mission, beginning with the Viking program in the 1970s. We continue to incorporate innovative technologies and decades of experience into each new spacecraft, and we're excited to continue our Mars heritage with the Perseverance Program. These many achievements highlight the breadth of our portfolio, our focus on innovation and next gen technologies and our commitment to providing the United States and its allies with 21st century capabilities to support crucial, national security missions. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.
Ken Possenriede: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter while maintaining our backlog of $147 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our balanced cash deployment actions, including the execution of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program this quarter, returning a total of $1.7 billion to our stockholders, including our quarterly dividend payments. With these results and strong performance from our Rotary and Mission Systems segment, we are able to increase our outlook for the year for all key financial metrics. And turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 4% compared with last year to $16.3 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. We had the segment operating margin of 10.8%, consistent with our expectations as we did not record any equity earnings this quarter due to no-launch events in our ULA joint venture at Space. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for first quarter 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.56 was $0.48 above our results last year, driven by volume and, as Jim mentioned, includes $0.18 of a gain from investments in our ventures fund. And I'll discuss this a little more in a subsequent slide. This was partially offset by $0.10 in severance charges from previously announced actions taken to improve efficiency and lower total cost for our business. On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash return to our stockholders this quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was nearly $1.5 billion. By executing our planned share repurchases of $1 billion in the first quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to return 119% of free cash flow to our stockholders quarter. And moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for the current years for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. On Chart 8, we showed the increase to our sales guidance range of $200 million, and reflected in our estimated sales range for Rotary and Mission Systems. This increase reaffirms our growth for 2021 projected to increase year-over-year by 4%. On Chart 9, we show our outlook for segment operating profit by business area. And consistent with sales, we have increased our RMS in our outlook by $25 million. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our increased guidance for 2021 earnings per share. As I noted a moment ago, we recorded a $68 million gain on strategic investments we hold in our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund, which translates to approximately $0.18 in earnings per share. As Jim noted previously, these investments are part of our growth strategy, focused on innovative technology and early stage companies and their valuations may fluctuate over time. Moving on, reduced tax expense as a result of the American Rescue Plan Act and the timing and execution of our share repurchases have also favorably impacted our outlook for EPS, as has the increased earnings we noted from Rotary and Mission Systems. There is an offset to incorporate the nonrecurring severance charge we discussed earlier. In total, our full year earnings per share outlook has increased by $0.40 at the midpoint of the range. On Chart 11, we will look at our increased cash flow forecast for 2021, and with increases also estimated for 2022 and 2023. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we are no longer planning to make a $1 billion discretionary pension contribution in 2021. This benefit is partially offset by reduced pension tax deductions with the net increase to cash estimated to be about $600 million. The net impact also improves our anticipated cash flow in '22 and '23. This change allows us to recover the entire $8.3 billion of existing CAS prefunding credits by 2026. And based upon this change in law and our current estimates and assumptions for future pension asset performance, we do not believe there will be a required pension cash contribution before the year 2026 and minimal contributions thereafter. In total, this change in legislation increases our three-year cash flow estimate by $1 billion, and combined with reduced future CAS expenses, will improve our cost competitiveness and our affordability to customers going forward. I should note, as I did on our last call that this outlook and trends are prior to an R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that's effective in 2022. And to conclude, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe that the first quarter of 2021 has laid the foundation for a strong year. Our backlog remains robust, and our key programs continue to deliver growth and sustained performance. We have increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And as a result of a change in legislation, our three-year cash flow expectations have grown by $1 billion. And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And first with the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Rob Spingarn: I wanted to dig into space a little bit. Two-part question, one for each of you. And I thought I'd start with Ken. And just wondering how we think about top line growth for the three space subsegments, so satellite, strategic and defensive missiles and space transport over the next few years ex the AWE fade, particularly now that we have some budget details from NASA. And then, Jim, while we're on the topic of space and NASA and with the Artemis HLS award to SpaceX last week, and all of the other start-ups we're seeing, the new space crowd is coming on strong, and I wanted to ask you how you think about that from Lockheed's perspective. Thank you.
Ken Possenriede: Sure. Hey, Rob, it's Ken. I'll start off with your long-term question regarding top line growth. So everyone is aware, if you look at the last couple of years, we've had a very strong order book in our space business. Some of it planned and frankly, some of it nice surprises. So if you go around the horn - if you look at our National Security Space segment, I'd say probably the biggest growth opportunity we have there is, is in our classified space area. We are seeing an enormous amount of opportunities out there. A lot of them planned. And frankly, a lot of them that we are helping shape. And so I'd say, long term, there's a lot of opportunities there in national security space. From a strategic and missile defense standpoint, I would start out with what Jim described as a very nice win for us, which was the NGI contract. I think over the next couple of years, we're going to see some nice opportunity from a growth standpoint there that - that program will be developing and demonstrating JATO enabling systems, and they'll be ready for operational use as early as today. So some opportunities there. I'd say the second area of large top line growth opportunity is our hypersonics business. So if you think about hypersonics today, we're going to do about $1.5 billion, rough numbers, of sales in our hypersonics area. And roughly about two-thirds of that is in our space business. Think of that as CPS. So I think some strong opportunities there. And then commercial space, probably not as robust growth as the other two business segments, but we do see some opportunities there, and that's in light of Homeland Security. I'm also going to mention the one initiative with omni space that Jim brought up. I think there's some exciting opportunities there, not just in the government arena, but also in the commercial arena that will help shape with them. And then I think the last piece I'll talk about is our LM-100 initiative. This is a midsized satellite bus that can support missions to both LEO and GEO. And that will be joining our fleet of the LM-50 and the LM-2100 series. And some of those investments in advanced payload technologies and demonstrations, we'll be using that bus that can yield some future growth. So I think there are a lot of exciting opportunities there for us in space. It really is an opportunity-rich environment.
James Taiclet: And Rob, when it comes to space from a strategic standpoint, I think the important framework to start with here is that 80% or more of our space operations revenue comes in national security space and strategic missile defense. So the remaining 20% is where sort of the action is on exploration. And we're playing right in the middle of that. So we're on the - largely commercial team, led by Blue Origin and the national team on the moon lander. That our team did not particularly be successful in this, didn't mean we weren't participating. We were part and parcel of the new order, if you will, in civil space and teamed up with Blue Origin. On the other hand, we've got a franchise position on Orion. And Orion is the actual crew compartment spacecraft that will be used for the Artemis missions going forward. So we've got a great position there. We'll continue to work with whether it's omni space or others, Blue Origin, SpaceX, whatever makes sense for us from a partnership/competition perspective. We're going to play, and we're going to be there. But again, 80% of our system - Space Systems net revenue is going to be coming from, again, franchise situations and strategic missile defense and national security space where I'm not seeing those newer firms play at the level where they can compete with us.
Operator: Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. Your sort of vision for the company that you talked about would seem to require maybe some changes in the way that the department interacts with contractors. I guess, after being in the role for a year, what would you say are the top one or two changes that you need from the department to kind of really drive the 21st century warfare strategy? And what's the plan for getting those?
James Taiclet: Sure. Let me just frame up the strategy quickly for everyone on the call. And then for each of the sort of four or five main areas, I'll make a point as to what we hope to encourage and work with our government customer to do on their side. So overall, our objective is to lead our National Defense enterprise, which is industry and government and the military services toward a higher and faster trajectory of development. This is essential to meet the challenges, I think, in an area of resurgent great power competition. So this isn't just a business strategy. I think it's a national strategy that's an imperative. And at Lockheed Martin, we're in a great position to try to lead that with our customer base. And there's really four or five elements. And so I'll hit each element and say, well, what do we hope to get along with our behavior from our government customer and the military services to work with us on this. First of all, I think we - it's imperative. Again, we established what we call a 5G.mil network architecture. So something that is a standards-based architecture with interfaces, frequencies we're going to use, bands we're going to employ, ways to do hierarchies and use intellectual property from numerous companies inside and outside the defense enterprise to actually create an architecture just like you see being done in, say, 5G in the telecommunications world. I think we can lead that for a number of reasons, but we're going to absolutely have to have our government customer involved with us. And when you look at exercises like Orange Flag, that demonstrates that they see the need as well. And ultimately, we're going to have to have an ability to work with our customer base to have new acquisition and appropriations processes so that we can speed things up and get things done faster than the kind of world we're talking about. One of the things that frankly is a core competency of Lockheed Martin is dealing with the federal acquisition regulations and I do feel we can be a bridge, during the sort of changeover period, if you will, to commercial tech. We can license with them on one hand, the way they used to working and we'll deal with the federal government as far as the contracting goes on that side. I think we can be a great bridge for that. But the first thing we need to do is establish that architecture and have cooperation with our government customers to do it and we are. The second thing is we really intend to partner with these leading companies in the telecom and technology space, because we need as a defense enterprise to accelerate our adoption of those 21st century technologies and capabilities. So again, we'll try to be the pivot point for that, linking the two industries with our customer, but we're going to have to again have an interest in adapting procurement processes and speed to the kind of speed that the commercial companies are used to. There's an interesting model for this, the intelligence community, there are some budgets that are handled at the DNI level, which have a lot more flexibility than the standard DoD budget line would have. And so that's just one idea, but we need to start working with our customer closely on some of those fast-track kind of initiatives. The next piece of what we're going to do at Lockheed Martin is we're going to enable eventually all of our major platform programs in aerospace, maritime and land domains to seamlessly connect into this architecture. And then on the customer side, we're going to have to work with them to make sure that they're comfortable using the standards that we come up with and some of the software defined network protocols that we intend to use, we're going to work with them on that. Now why that's important is because, currently the sequential design test paradigm that the Department of Defense uses to develop weapon systems is too perfectionist and too slow to actually do this. And so we want to work with our government customers to use a more rapid development process. So for example, on hypersonics, we're already using it. We look for 80%, 20% kind of splits on success on all the test points and metrics, and we move on to the next test. We don't strive for 99% to 100% because that will be too slow to get this done. So there's a sequential design test paradigm change, frankly, that we have to work with our customers to achieve there too. And at the end of all this, why are we doing that? I think at the end of it all, our customers are going to achieve greater returns capability and operational abilities by moving toward this direction. And our shareholders are going to benefit too, because we're going to be a stronger and more resilient growth machine and engine for our business. So there's benefits to shareholders, there's benefits to government, and we hope to lead the charge on this.
Operator: And our next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Jim, there's been some commentary out of Congress over the last month or so about the F-35 and the operating cost of the aircraft. I was wondering if you can give us your perspectives on this issues? And what the obstacles could be to getting this operating cost down to an agreeable level? Thank you.
James Taiclet: Sure. So what I'll start with is an ex-Air Force pilot and have been spoken to Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States, this aircraft is the most capable fighter plane ever developed in history. It's got a lot of leading-edge technology with it. Just the propulsion system alone integrated with the stealth technology is pretty groundbreaking. It enables this airplane to do things that no other one can do and survive in the process of that. The other piece of it is Lockheed Martin was the head of even my thinking in making sure that the F-35 would be ultimately a hybrid-based station or a mobile compute node for the battlefield. And so we've got the sensor capability, the computer processing power and the communication linkages from that airplane to the network. Again, that makes the airplane much more than just a single-purpose fighter. So having said all that, it's an expensive machine. It's expensive to maintain in large part because of the stealth technology that's more advanced than anywhere else. Having said all that, we are working on all three dimensions of affordability with the customer very closely, myself included. And that is on production, where we've already achieved - the company has already achieved the goal of $80 million F-35A, and we're $1million or $2 million below that these days. So production is in good shape. We're going to keep working on it. For modernization, this airplane, because of this evolving threat and the speed of which that's happening, is going to have to continually modernize. And if we can employ some of these commercial technology practices into our own modernization program, we'll be able to get some efficiencies out of that. And then sustainment is also key. And what we need to do is have a joint strategy and develop it with our program office and our services through the end customers that have to actually fix this aircraft and maintain it in the field to get the optimal sustainment strategy, the right level of funding for spare parts, etc., and really clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the depot system, for frontline maintenance and for the OEM and our supply chain. I think that's a very doable thing, and we're embarking on that led by the joint program office and the service team. So I think we're going to address all three dimensions. And that the goals that the government has put in place for us at $25,000 a flight hour, if we work with them in tandem, is achievable.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Ken, maybe just a high level one on the backlog, your target, I think, of $150 billion in 2021. Maybe if you could just walk us through some of the key moving pieces that you think they're going to allow you to get there? And anything to call out on the international front? And just, Jim, related to that, if you could also just comment if you're seeing any kind of changes in the administration on the international award front? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So yes, from an order standpoint, you're right, Peter. We think if you look book-to-bill, it will be by the end of the year, it will be above 1, and we should be close to about $150 billion. A couple of the key awards that will get us going forward. There's a variety of F-35 orders. I'd say probably the one worth highlighting or the two worth highlighting is, if you recall, Lot 15 for F-35, we deferred the booking of that last year, and we moved that into this year. That's a big order. And in there, there is - just sticking with the international theme, there is a good size of not just U.S. airplanes, but also partner countries and FMS countries. The other big F-35 order, which is in the fourth quarter, would be Lot 16 production. And think of that as just ballpark $9 billion. And similar to Lot 15, it's got U.S. airplanes. It's got partner airplanes and FMS airplanes. In fact, when you start getting out into that time period, the partner and FMS percentage of aircraft starts getting close to roughly 50%. And so we still see continued demand there. We have a handful of other international aeronautics orders out there. There's a few F-16 orders. There's a few C-130 orders. Another key one will be the next tranche of CH-53K. That's Lot 5. We're expecting that order this year. There's a bunch of PAC-3, fiscal year buys that we're expecting this year. There is a reasonable size span order for the Space business, which is Australia. There's a few special programs out of space. So I would say we are extremely comfortable with our orders profile. I would say the only one that possibly could move out to the right would be the Lot 16 production order. And again, that will just be timing, the joint program office, and us get alignment on pricing. And in fact, just - I'll just bring up the point. I'm sure someone's going to want to talk about the pension change. But one of the rationales for us to quickly declare why we're going to implement the CAS adoption to 2022 was for us to get that into our forward-pricing rates into 2022 and beyond. Because in fairness to our customers, they're not going to conclude negotiations with us until we push that down to the - that benefit down to the business areas and into their forward pricing rate. So that was one of the key reasons we made that declaration now, and started in 2022 because that will help with the Lot 15 negotiations that are going on now and many other large negotiations we have going on now.
James Taiclet: And Peter, it's Jim. When it comes to the current administration's approach to international defense, I think there's really four important points to make. One is, the Biden administration clearly recognizes that we're all in the year of this resurgent great power competition and regional disruptive powers that are out there as well like Iran and North Korea. That's a world that's not going to get any more peaceful anytime soon, most likely. And so strong national defense is a priority of the administration, I believe, based on their own statements. Secondly, the Biden administration is reinforced and elevated the criticality of alliances to actually meet this kind of situation. And that again is a positive for international defense cooperation. The third item that I note is that there's a very experienced and capable foreign policy national security cadre of leaders, lifetime professionals, many of them in this space, and they know exactly what they're dealing with and how to make it work. And then fourth, yes, there's going to be some process alignment between the White House, the Department of the State Department of Defense and Congress on how to actually conduct all of this. But I do see strong opportunities going forward under this administration for international defense cooperation, and that would benefit Lockheed Martin I expect.
Operator: And next, we'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Good morning. Ken, I wanted to pursue Aeronautics a little bit. I mean, sales were flat in the quarter. How much of that was due to having one less week in the quarter? Deliveries were like 17 versus 22 for the F-35 and you lost some revenues from taking the development contract down. So do we make up the shortage of revenues in the fourth quarter when we pick up the week? And if you could just get into a little bit more of the detail like I was just asking.
Ken Possenriede: Sure, George. Good morning. Yes, the main driver of why Aeronautics was flat, frankly, was - and this is non-COVID related. We had a sizable couple of hundred million dollar vendor invoice that we anticipated to hit in the first quarter. George, that actually hit - it hit already, so it hit in the month of April. So it was just - that was a timing event. So I'm not so certain 12 weeks versus 14 weeks is going to have that much of an impact. That was really more of a delay in the invoice from the first quarter to the second quarter. But just to give you a little color, in the first quarter, basically, F-35 was generally down. And that's mainly due to development being down. I'd say production on the whole was relatively flat and sustainment was up modestly. And then to your point, we're going to continue to see momentum in the quarter - in the upcoming quarters. And in fact, to your point, the largest quarter for Aeronautics is the fourth quarter. So yes, you will see some of that continue going into the fourth quarter. So I think it's fair just to say it was the vendor payment slip into the second quarter. Second quarter is a little less than the third and the fourth, but there - all three of them are, I would say, somewhat considerably higher than our first quarter. So thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: So in the quarter, Ken, you talked about 10.8% segment margins. I think a couple of years back, the corporation was doing 12%, north of 12%. So I wanted to ask about how you view the potential opportunity for mix and productivity to improve segment margins in a more difficult budget environment from here? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: Thanks, David. You want to talk about beyond 2021, I assume?
David Strauss: Exactly.
Ken Possenriede: Okay. So, yes, I think it's probably best we go around each of the four business areas. So if you look at the mix at Aeronautics, F-35 is still going to be a dominant piece of Aeronautics regardless of how quickly the rest of the segments of that business area growing, and I'll get into that in detail. But so if you just peel the onion on F-35. Jim mentioned when he answered the sustainability question, if you look at the three elements, a nice pleasant surprise for us, which is a good news story is, there is a demand still for added capability, added technology on the airplane that we - and our partner companies are working on. So we still see development being a decent size, relatively speaking, decent-sized piece of the portfolio. It's going to be cost plus, so dilutive, but we'll take it, which then takes us to production, which is still going to be the lion's share of that piece of the portfolio. And I've said this before, if we perform on our current contracts as we believe we should be able to, and we're able to get acceptable deals on our future LRIPs, there should be some margin opportunity there. The only thing I'd caution is, we're looking at our performance on Lot 12 through 14 now. And whether we do a risk retirement later this year, we want to see some more improvement there before we do that. So I think the point I just made is valid that the opportunity is there. We have to perform, and we're just keeping a close eye on that. And then sustainment is going to be the fastest-growing piece of this - part of the portfolio, and it will continue to grow. I mean, we're going to continue to stand up bases. We're going to continue need sparing. We will back on the follow-on modernization work we're doing in development. We'll have to retrofit some of those aircraft that are already in the field. But today, they're cost plus and our customers buying on an annual basis, which is the argument Jim made, is inefficient. There's going to have to be - we believe there's a better way to procure, and that's why we offered that performance-based logistics concept and we'll see where that goes, if that morphs into something. And if industry is prepared as we are to take on the investment and take on the risk and sign up to a service-level agreement, and we perform, there should be some profit opportunities there. F-16, we've got 128 aircraft in backlog, five customers. We have - we see a lot of interest out there internationally from many, many countries. We're going to deliver eight aircraft next year. And we will, basically, by the middle of this decade, ramp up to about three, 3.5 airplane deliveries per month. There should be - and they're all FMS contracts. That's the way the customer is procuring them today. There should be some margin opportunity there for us. And then the last piece of Aeronautics is our Skunk Works. And it is our fastest-growing piece of Aeronautics, likely will be in the foreseeable future. But a lot of those contracts are classified. A lot of them are cost plus. Again, maybe margin erosion, but I'll take the top line growth with the added profit any day. So that's Aeronautics. Missiles and Fire Control, I think we have the opportunity to keep the margins where they are today. We do have a little bit of a mix issue. We should continue to see strong demand for PAC-3s into the foreseeable future. We're continuing to build out real estate to continue with the needed demand out there. And then the other piece that is going to continue to be quite large and continue to grow is in the classified area, which today is cost plus, will be in the foreseeable future, which will have a dilutive effect on margins, but we'll take that any day. And ultimately, that should morph into production and fixed price and allow us to grow margins there. At RMS, I think it's probably best to talk about Sikorsky. We're starting to see the CH-53K go into production. Jim in his prepared comments talked about some of the international opportunities, specifically Israel we have there, which will be a great opportunity for us. A lot of these other helicopter programs are now into production. And then ultimately, we'll have to down-select on FLRAA and FARA and we're bullish on those. And by the end of this decade, it will start - they'll start out as development programs. By the end of this decade, they'll be in production as well and hopefully see some margin improvements there. And then lastly, Space. Space, if it wasn't for AWE, they would be our fastest-growing business area this year at 7%. And we should see, with our core space business, we should continue to see growth there. It will be a mix between cost plus and fixed price. United Launch Alliance is alive and well, and will continue to be, and will give us a nice equity earnings stream. But I see some - based on where we are today, I see some margin upside there as well based on where they are today.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Safran with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Rich Safran: So given the accelerated share repurchases, I wanted to ask you again about capital deployment and just how you're thinking about it. Does the accelerated share repurchase infer any change in how you're thinking about the balance between dividends, buybacks and M&A? And on that topic, is there any intent to continue to or make larger investments in businesses and technologies like ABL?
Ken Possenriede: Okay. Hey, Rich, it's Ken. Hopefully, this will resonate with you, but I think it's a consistent story. First and foremost, we're going to generate as much cash as we can, and that was one of the rationales of why we decided to start deferring our ERISA funding in 2021 from an economic standpoint. That made the most sense. But first and foremost, we're going to invest in our business, whether that's organic or inorganically. We have still some decent-sized capital outlays this year of, rough numbers, about $1.8 billion. We're at record levels of IRAD spend this year, and we'll continue to do that. And we'll - this - again, we'll focus on organic. And then inorganically, in Jim's prepared statements, we talked about Aerojet Rocketdyne. That's on-track. We just got our second request from the FTC, which is no surprise. Nothing has changed. We're still very bullish about that for that to come to resolution in the fourth quarter of this year. And then it comes down to the excess cash, what do we do with it? We are focused on our dividend strategy. That would be the next in the batting order. We're going to - in the third quarter, Jim and I will go see the Board with our Treasurer, John Mallard, to make a recommendation on what's the appropriate increase in our dividends, and it should be deemed favorable to our shareholders. And then lastly, it's share buybacks. And frankly, Rich, what we saw in the first quarter where our stock was trading, we thought it was grossly undervalued, and we went into this accelerated share buyback plan and deemed to be very successful. And we will opportunistically, in the next three quarters, buy back stock where it makes sense. And think of that as anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in the next three months. We have the balance sheet to do everything I just described, and we'll continue evaluating that. And I'll hand it over to Jim to talk about if there's any other investments in - I think you mentioned ABL and other type opportunities out there.
James Taiclet: Yes, Rich. And going back to that overall strategic framework that I outlined earlier, you hear a lot in there about partnering with leading technology companies, leveraging commercial industry research and development investments. They've already made or are making to reduce our costs that we then transmit to our customer. So we want to use the full range of transactional options with inclusive of our defense industrial-based colleagues that we're used to dealing with, but well beyond that, right? So ABL is more of a kind of a bulk-buy-option type commercial agreement, for example, which is maybe the lowest on the spectrum of what you might do all the way up through partnerships, which are like-for-like contributions, joint ventures, which are actual equity agreements with different companies like we have with ULA, for example. And then full-on acquisitions like Aerojet Rocketdyne or i3, which is a smaller tech company that we bought last year. So we're going to use that full range of transactional options to pursue the strategy that I talked about. So you'll see us be, I think, a little more creative at times a more open aperture. But it will be thoughtful. It will all fit within the batting order that Ken just described. But we're going to make sure that we're being widely viewing the options so that we can take advantage of cost reduction of R&D that's made in other sectors or of other business models. So just one last point on this, some of that's already going to invest in low-orbit at scale production for commercial uses, well, maybe we could tap into some of that - their production for military and defense uses. And again, let them do the capex investment, and we'll just commercially buy off what we need from them, which is similar to ABLs agreement.
Operator: And our next question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: How has the relationship with ABL evolved since initially investing in the company? And also, what does an exit of an investment look like at LM Ventures? Will you eventually acquire them, sell your stake or IPO? How do you look at that?
Ken Possenriede: Hey, Kristine, it's Ken. We really didn't make an investment in ABL. What we basically agreed to is to commit to a range of launch vehicles. And think of this for lower-level satellites that don't require the horsepower of, say, our United Launch Alliance. The only investment we do have is it's in our Ventures group. And think of that as this is more for the technology that they bring to make our products better. And it's a relatively modest - that's a relatively modest investment. So I'm not sure I would look at it as something that from an acquisition standpoint. And the question you asked for when do we look at getting out of those type investments? So we did - as you heard, we did have some investments that actually went public, that allowed us to make a gain. Some of those are back, which we're going to be required to hold, and then we'll make a determination whether it makes sense for Lockheed Martin to get out of those ventures, but then to continue to utilize that technology. And just as an example, ABL, we would do something very similar. And again, I'm not suggesting that whether they're public or not. We would just make a determination when it makes sense for that modest investment in them, that we have whether it makes sense for us to get out or not and just continue to utilize their technologies.
Greg Gardner: John, this is Greg. I think we have time for one more.
Operator: And that will be from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: So help me think about this. In the quarter, right, F-35 volume was down and F-22 volume was down. And I think about those as kind of the underlying foundation of the company. How can we get comfortable that that's not going to be a trend that - I mean that growth engine is still healthy in there?
Ken Possenriede: Sure. I'll take that, Ron. Good morning. I think a little bit goes back to what George was asking me in terms of the first quarter versus the rest of it. So I would say on production, we're down - it's - I'm going to call it flat, Ron, just because it's down year-over-year, $25 million. But what we're basically looking at on development on the whole - and this goes back to the earlier conversation. This in some ways is for Lockheed Martin is a good problem to have, we continue to have that demand out there for increasing technology, but I don't see development growing. So let's, for year-over-year, call it, flat production. just based on - if you think about production revenues, it's really not for the most part, it's really not for the deliveries we're making this year, which are Lot 12 and Lot 13. It's really for the deliveries we're making next year. We're building those aircraft out now for next year. And then we're doing the buy ahead, if you will, for the following year. That's generally where the sales are coming for this year. And we're fairly confident - we're very confident, I should say, in the stream and the flow of what's going on. So think of production is going to grow this year low single digits. And I've been relaying that sales are going to continue to grow at a relatively slow pace for production. The growth is in sustainment. And in the quarter, we did see growth in sustainment, and we will see growth for the year in the - close to the almost 10% range. So I don't think that's a concern. I think F-22 - I'm not sure you called that the linchpin or the bedrock of the business area. I'd say, Ron, relatively speaking, F-16 is almost double the size of F-22. I think that's more of the parameter of where the rest of aeronautics is going, including the Skunk Works. I would say F-22 is going to continue to be flat and declining as well C-130, and the pleasant surprise on C-130 is it's not declining as quickly as we thought it was. The team has done a nice job of getting congressional adds from the United States government and international customers for that great workhorse. And that's going to be flat over time. So I'd say your big drivers going forward for growth at Aeronautics will be sustainment on F-35, F-16 and then the Skunk Works and then the bedrock, if you will, will be the modest growth that we're going to have going forward on production.
Greg Gardner: John, this is Greg. I think we've come up on the top of the hour here, so I will turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.
James Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Lockheed Martin had a strong first quarter, delivering outstanding performance operationally for our customers, providing continued growth and value for you, the stockholders too, and I want to just close by reiterating my thanks to the Lockheed Martin team for their dedication and commitment to excellence during a difficult time for everyone. And thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. And that concludes the call for today. Thanks again, everybody.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-26 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: [Technical Difficulty]
Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. And good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a great start to the New Year and at this call, I find you and your family safe and healthy. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. As we review our results, strategic new business activities, key accomplishments and our outlook for 2021. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the loss of Michele Evans, our aeronautics business area leader, who passed away earlier this month. Michele dedicated 34 years of service to our company and touched the lives of countless people both inside and outside the corporation. I knew Michele for years and I can say that she was the life of strength and grace. And while we mourn our loss, we also are thankful to had her as part of our Lockheed Martin family, we’ll miss Michele.  As we look back to the year from a broader perspective, 2020 introduced personal and professional challenges to each and every one of us. I'll begin my summary of Lockheed Martin's results today by thanking the men and women of our company and their families, for stepping up to deliver outstanding performance during extremely difficult time. It was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to drive operational and financial results, which not only exceeded many of our expectations, but also set records in several areas. The coronavirus outbreak remains an ongoing pandemic and we're continuing to take actions to mitigate its impacts. Vaccines are also becoming available to help combat this disease and we're hopeful for a return to a more normal business environment, as we progress throughout the year. Our dedicated workforce and our resilient supply chain continue to perform with excellence during these demanding times, supporting our global customers and their important missions and I'm very proud of their accomplishments. Moving to our results, we delivered another year of outstanding performance in 2020, strategically, operationally and financially. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide our full-year 2021 financial outlook. But I'd like to provide a few highlights from the past year. A period in which we set high watermarks in sales, earnings and cash from operations. First, sales and segment profit each grew 9% over 2019 and our 2020 earnings per share increased by 11%. We had a strong year of cash generation, achieving $8.2 billion of cash from operations, even after a $1 billion voluntary pension contribution and after accelerating payments to our supply chain to help mitigate COVID impacts. We are continuing this practice, prioritizing our vulnerable and small business partners. We recorded over $68 billion in orders in 2020, growing our backlog by $3 billion, resulting in a robust $147 billion year-end total backlog. These results reflect a high level of execution being achieved across the company, providing critical security and deterrence solutions for our customers. As we look to 2021, our broad portfolio has us positioned for continued growth in all four of our business areas. We expect our cash generation to remain strong and we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions, investing in innovative technologies and strategic opportunities to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities and still returning cash to shareholders. Turning to defense budgets. For fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act has been passed into legislation and the Department of Defense Appropriations were approved as part of the FY '21 omnibus funding bill. Both of these congressional actions adhere to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, which established spending levels for discretionary, but defense budgets with a total fiscal year 2021 national defense spending target of approximately $740 billion. Also Congress passed $900 billion COVID relief package, which extended section 36-10 of the CARES Act to March 31, providing federal agencies the authority to reimburse contractors who are temporarily unable to work due to facility closures or other restrictions.  Lockheed Martin programs were well supported in the FY '21 appropriations bill with Congress adding funding of over $1.7 billion for 17 additional F-35 aircraft and other development and integration activities for the program. Adding nearly $900 [million] [ph] for 9 additional C-130Js plus support work for that airplane. And over $400 million for Sikorsky programs including additional CH-53-K and Black Hawk helicopters. And also the initiation of an 8 THAAD battery for the US Army. Turning to our portfolio, I would like to touch on several notable achievements, demonstrating our focus on strategic growth and operational performance. As we announced last month, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne, an action that once finalized will bring long-term strategic value to our entire portfolio. As we commented then our 21st century warfare strategy includes enabling growth areas such as hypersonics, tactical and integrated air and missile defense and space systems domains. Aerojet's expertise in propulsion systems will benefit our existing hypersonic programs as they progress from development to production and will improve our tactical missiles and air and missile defense products, while continuing Aerojet Rocketdyne's legacy as a merchant supplier to the entire industry. We believe this combination will deliver innovations and improve efficiencies that will offer more timely and affordable solutions for all of our customers, including the Defense Department domestic manufacturers and our international partners and we're very excited about this transaction. Moving to the business areas. In aeronautics, our F-35 team finished the year strong, delivering a total of 120 F-35 aircrafts. Our aero production organization, our partners, teammates in the supply chain, all worked to overcome manufacturing issues introduced by this pandemic. We've now delivered over 600 airplanes since the program's inception with nearly 360 jets still in backlog and domestic as well as international opportunities ahead of us. Over 2/3 of the jets in the plan of record are still to be ordered. So the aircraft continues to perform well, it's operating from 26 bases and ships around the globe. And the Royal Australian Air Force recently declared initial operating capability in December. The seventh country to do so since the program began. Also in our aeronautics business, the US Air Force awarded $900 million contract for us to provide sustainment and support services for F-16 aircraft, including maintenance and modification activities. Of course, the F-16 is one of our longest-running production programs and we will look to optimize the Air Force's F-16 fleet for greater capability, readiness and performance via this new sustainment contract. Moving to our space business area, we recently won a $4.9 billion award for our next generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR contract. This award funds the production of 3 geosynchronous satellites and ground systems to provide initial warning of ballistic or tactical missile launches anywhere in the world. These new space vehicles will have more powerful sensors and greater resiliency to enhance our Nation's air and missile defense capabilities well under the 21st century.  Keeping with our space organization, we're pleased to be selected for one of the awards to develop a prototype payload for the new evolved strategic satellite communication systems. ESS is designed to be the successor to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency constellation satellites, one of our signature programs that provide secure and survivable strategic communications for national leaders and tactical commanders alike. This is our OPIR satellites, the ESS Constellation is intended to provide improved resiliency, survivability and increased capabilities. We look forward to participating in this opportunity as we work to enrich our platforms with more mission systems content, which is another key facet of our 21st century warfare strategy. I'll close with our Rotary and Mission Systems and missiles and fire control business areas, which recently led Lockheed Martin's participation in an exercise Valiant Shield 2020, which is a bi-annual joint effort for the US Navy, Army, Air Force and Marine Corps. Our combined team used virtualized Aegis weapon system to conduct a pioneering, joint multi-domain, long fires demonstrations. By delivering machine-to-machine interfaces across joint force systems, this effort accelerated speed of decision making and then the action. It demonstrated a primary premise of our 21st century war fighting strategy by networking separate sensors, communication links and weapons across multiple platforms. The result is more effective joint all the main operations that provides enhanced capabilities and greater effectiveness to the commander in a field of operations. This achievement highlight our strategy to help address emerging threats with 21st Century capabilities, to invest in new and innovative technologies and leverage our signature programs to provide powerful deterrence to future military conflicts. That's our mission and with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.
Ken Possenriede: Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share from continuing operations close with a record annual highs. We generated $8.2 billion of cash from operations after a $1 billion discretionary contribution to our pension trust this quarter and we continued our cash deployment actions, returning $3.9 billion of cash to our shareholders for a combination of dividend and share repurchases. While continuing to invest in the strategic growth of the business, including acquiring i3 and record investments in IRAD and capital expenditures. We also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne in the fourth quarter with the close expected in the second half of 2021. I will note that our 2021 outlook include -- excludes all results associated with this transaction. While backlog declined approximately $3 billion in the quarter due primarily to the timing of the F-35 lot 15 production order, 2020 represented the sixth consecutive annual increase in year-end backlog for the corporation. In summary, it was an outstanding year for the business and Lockheed Martin is well positioned for continued success in 2021. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% in 2020 compared with last year to $65.4 billion, continuing the strong performance over the first three quarters, while segment operating profit also increased 9% over last year to nearly $7.2 billion. On Chart 5, we compare sales by business area with last year's results. As Jim mentioned, all four of our business areas experienced strong sales growth in 2020 led by aeronautics and missiles and fire control at 11%. Aeronautics growth was driven by development and sustainment increases on F-35 and F-16 as well as growth in advanced development programs. Missiles and fire controls growth was primarily from production volume in Tactical Strike Missiles and air and missile defense lines of business. I will note that all four of our business areas achieved record highs for sales in 2020. Chart 6 shows our earnings per share for 2020. Our EPS from continuing operations of $24.50 was up $2.55 or 12% higher than our results from last year, driven primarily by increased volume and sustained performance. On Chart 7, we'll discuss our backlog. Driven by annual increases at three of our four business areas, we maintained a book to bill ratio above one for the full year of 2020. This continued backlog growth combined with further visibility of our 2021 orders, provides additional confidence in our increased sales outlook for 2021. On Chart 8, we'll discuss the cash return to our shareholders in 2020. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $8.2 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was greater than $6.4 billion nearly a 6% increase over to 2019. This growth was achieved despite accelerating more payments to our supply chain and we received from the favorable DoD initiated progress payment increases and the deferral of payroll taxes under the CARES Act. We increased our dividend by more than 8% and executed our planned share repurchases for the year with $1.1 billion in total shares retired. This brought our total cash returned to shareholders to $3.9 billion for the year or 60% of free cash flow providing a solid returns to the shareholders in 2020. Moving on to Chart 9. We provide our outlook for the year ahead. Our outlook for sales ranges from $67.1 billion to $68.5 billion. The midpoint of this range represents nearly a 4% increase over 2020 and improving from our October estimate, even after incorporating the impact of the UK March decision to insource contract support for the atomic weapons establishment. The $700 million sales reduction for this change is reflected in our outlook for the space business. We're not for this decision, our estimated sales increase would have been approximately 5%, which is greater than the estimated 3% sales growth we discussed in the last earnings call. We have incorporated the known COVID impacts into our 2021 financial outlook. We will continue to work with our US government customers to monitor COVID risk to our operations in the supply chain and we will continue exploring potential path to recovery of cost impacts, where appropriate to minimize future impacts. The range for segment operating profit is estimated to be approximately $7.4 billion to $7.5 billion. Our estimated FAS, CAS pension adjustment is approximately $2.3 billion. Our estimated range for 2021 earnings per share grows to between $26 to $26.30. The midpoint of this range represents approximately an 8% increase over 2020 results. Cash from operations is now projected to meet or exceed $8.3 billion and I will discuss this in greater detail on the following chart. On Chart 10, we will walk through our future cash expectations, folding in the $1 billion discretionary pension payment we made last quarter. Strong operational performance drove a reduction in working capital, which allowed us to increase our cash outlook for 2021 to greater than or equal to $8.3 billion. We now see approximately $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations in 2022, increasing our three-year cash generation estimate by $900 million over our prior assessment. And as we sit here now, we see 2023 cash from operations of approximately $9 billion. I should know this outlook and trends are prior to an estimated R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act change that would impact 2022 cash by approximately $2.1 billion and lower 2023 cash by approximately $1.8 billion. On Chart 11, we break down our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area. All four business areas are positioned for continued sales growth in 2021, approximately 4% for the corporation, led by aeronautics at 5%. Segment operating profit growth is also projected to grow at approximately 4% into aggregate with our largest growth in Aeronautics at 6%. And finally on Chart 12 we have our summary. We believe 2020 was an exceptional year for Lockheed Martin during these challenging times. Our team diligently work to minimize the impacts of the pandemic to our business and our supply chain. We have increased our estimates for 2021 for all key financial metrics. Our results in 2020 exceed the previous highs and have positioned us well for continued growth and value creation this upcoming year. We remain focused on cash generation and growth in 2021, we will continue to invest in discriminating technologies and strategic initiatives to deliver value to our customers, while providing strong cash returns to stockholders. And with that, we're ready for your questions. Brad?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Thank you for the question. Jim, could you speak to your broader space strategy? And I appreciate your comments on Aerojet in your prepared remarks. But can you be more specific on how it creates value, particularly in the absence of -- maybe a broader strategy or is it actually part of a broader rollout strategy? I mean, are you guys thinking about doing more strategic actions in space and how are you thinking about space for Lockheed Martin?
Jim Taiclet: Ron, I came into this role with Lockheed Martin being the leader in National Security Space, as it is. And the benefit of the position of the company is that we have a strong position in the -- I would say, classic large bus military defense satellites and intelligent community satellites. So we also have the ability to go down range into medium and lower, but as well as geosynchronous or and so. The whole playing field in national defense space is open to Lockheed Martin and what we're doing in the business is, we're introducing these 21st century technologies and taking advantage of that space platform. And so you see us winning recently a low orbit transport layer contract, which is a pioneering initiative of the Department of Defense to start introducing 5G and other modern networking technologies into the space domain, we're part of that. And what we've been able to do is to connect our space assets already using some of those newer technologies and AI and also distributed compute into our Aerospace, land and sea forces, as well the platforms that we deploy there. So we have a broad space strategy which is to take 21st century networking, storage and compute technologies into our space domain as really a competitive advantage versus other defense contractors that don't have that asset available to them. The second part of your question is, well how does Aerojet Rocketdyne create value in doing this? And it really goes hand-in-hand with our hypersonic strategy, which is part of our 21st century war fighting initiative. I view Lockheed Martin's benefit or role in defense enterprise is adding velocity to it. The world is moving faster, both kinetically if you will and in the networking and AI perspective as well and we need to speed up. And just taking one dimension of that hypersonic missiles and countering a hypersonic missiles requires a much better tighter integration of the propulsion system into the body of the missile. The heat generated by these hypersonic missiles is incredible and just managing that heat and thermal issue, is one of the reasons we invested in i3 as well. So, we are selecting what we think are the most important defense platforms and connectivity capacities for the future of warfare and we're investing in those. And Aerojet Rocketdyne is part and parcel of that investment strategy. Propulsion integration into hypersonic missile, glide bodies is essential. The other benefit of us working more -- in a more integrated fashion with Aerojet Rocketdyne is, we'll be able to bring our broad engineering expertise, our capital and our operational experience into Aerojet Rocketdyne and bring the best of Lockheed Martin to the propulsion side of missiles and space. So there are incredible synergies here, I know Ken can speak to a little bit more of on those later both revenue and costs, but given my long answer I'll stop there.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Hey, good morning guys. Jim, can you talk about kind of your updated mid-term view of the DoD budget now that we have obviously new [sec-off] [ph] and administration, but maybe even more importantly a change of control to Senate. I'm just wondering what you're kind of seeing and hearing tea-leave wise in terms of the budget outlook? Thanks.
Jim Taiclet: Sure, Pete. The administration hasn't unveiled its actual plan or trajectory for defense budgets. But I take solace in a couple of things. One is that the national security and intelligence and international affairs team, President Biden is proposing has brought on is experienced, they are professionals in that realm of -- many of them having decades of senior government experience dealing with these issues and so you're going to have -- we believe a lot of continuity in policy and also in focus on how important strong defense is for this country. So I think the proposed team is a plus. And unfortunately, frankly the threat outside against potentially United States is growing. It's accelerating too by the way and when we look at the national defense strategy, it reorients itself and reorients our defense enterprise towards great power competition. And it's something you cannot just sit still and watch go by, because we will be overtaken because of the aggressiveness of our potential peers. So, I'm taking solace in these trends as far as the defense budget goes. That you have professional experienced people leading it for the administration and that threat environment is greater versus lesser, we feel that supports a stable defense budget going forward.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joseph DeNardi: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Ken, can you talk a little bit about the R&D tax impact. And I guess relative to the political backdrop, do you now see that playing out as more likely or is there still an outcome or that's less onerous. I mean, are you now planning differently than you were a few months ago in terms of the potential cash flow impact from that? Thank you.
Ken Possenriede: You bet. So yes, Joe, I have socialized with you guys as much as we could, once we concluded our view of what the tax law, the interpretation that was and as I stated a few times now it looks like it's about $2.1 billion in 2022, $1.8 billion in 2023 and it will continue trending down. One of the reasons we are extremely focused on cash, you heard in my prepared comments, the amount of cash that we're generating in '22 and '23. I've stated we've taken -- we took a pause for that roughly the second half of last year, before we started talking to the key constituents about that impact. It is still our belief that we think there is some likelihood it will either be repealed or altered, so it just doesn't include entire research expenses, which would include our cost-plus contracts. But would be just our research in our IRAD, our research and development costs, which would not be a material impact to our -- to the outlooks I gave you. We still think there is a good likelihood that's going to happen. Because if you think about it, if -- in 2022, we have $2.1 billion less of cash this is just Lockheed Martin and as you know Joe, this is not just Lockheed Martin and not just A&D, this is all of industry. So this is going to hit pharma hard, it's going to hit high-tech hard. These are dollars that we're not going to have the ability to plow back and invest into our portfolio and into our technologies. And I think that is a compelling story and I think at the end of the day, that's going to rule the day. Now having said that, we are still generating large amounts of cash. In fact, as you know, we ended the year in excess of $3 billion cash on hand. Right now assuming our dividend assumptions and our share repurchase assumptions for 2021, we're going to end 2021 with over $5 billion of cash. That number is going to continue to grow. And that frankly, that's a good opportunity for us to do the things Jim described from an investment standpoint and then to continue our robust cash deployment strategy that we have historically had with our shareholders.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. It's actually Mike Mogeri [ph] on for Hunter.
Jim Taiclet: Hi, Mike.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, so according to your filings from 2009 to 2017, square footage in your spaces that you lease or own fell 8.5 million square feet or 15% while you are still growing revenue. So I know that you have an investment in Palmdale coming up. But in the next budget down cycle, flattening whenever it should come facility consolidation. Is that a lever you'd be willing to pull or able to pull again?
Ken Possenriede: Yes, thanks for the question, Mike. It's Ken. So I think this year or 2020, we're going to end with roughly 72 million square feet and there's four pieces to that. One is, the space we actually own and a large share of that is going to be manufacturing space and that's about half of our real estate. And then the other half is a combination of leased space. GOCO, which is government owned contract or operated much like our Fort Worth facility and then GOGO, which is government owned government operated, which is AWE. And so there is a couple of just short term, there's a couple of puts it takes. Assuming the UK government does take over the management of AWE, we lose about 4.5 million square feet out of that 72 million squares. When we're successful with the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition, I believe they have about 3 million square feet that we would add back. You mentioned Mike, the Palmdale building that we're building, we also have a little bit of real estate that we're expanding in space and in RMS and in missiles and fire control and that nets about 1 million square feet. So at the end of the day, we're going to be down about a 0.5 million squares. But now the opportunity comes, right now we have roughly half of our employees working remotely. Some of them are periodically coming in, but we have over the last couple of months have rolled out a plan. Frankly looking at Lockheed Martin forward is what we call-in and it's frankly the future of work. And we are going to start looking at, getting out of some of that leased space as our leases expire, you can expect us to reduce our foot print by at least a couple of million square feet in the next couple of years, if not more. We will go to more hoteling, we will allow people that where it makes sense for them to work from home and we'll make sure this is a competitive and strategic advantage for us.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kristine Liwag: Good morning, guys. Jim, maybe I'm following on the question on the new administration, but in a slightly different way. How do you think about opportunities and challenges regarding foreign military sales. With the new administration, do you see more headwind or more tailwind than before?
Jim Taiclet: Good morning, Kristine. As far as international business, including foreign military sales. The Tennessee -- the people in the Biden administration and the President's sound statements reiterate his view that alliances are important that they need to be cultivated and that they have real value and deterrence in National Defense. And so I do think that will have a more open environment for FMS and indirect commercial sales to our international partners. The other benefit you've seen it recently in the press is that, we have some fantastic an unmatched products that are in great demand and highly desired by many countries. So you've seen F16 sales coming back, F35 was a pivotal element of the Abraham Accords we believe. And that system is so highly desired by our allies in the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere that it actually helped putting a modicum of piece to the Middle East. And so our prop between our products and the Biden administrations stated proclivity to enhance our alliances, I think we're in a better position going forward.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland: Good morning, gentlemen. A big figure, Q4 is probably the best time to ask a question like this, just to get some color on it. But classified has obviously been a big component of bookings and growth in your focus. I wondered, if you might can give us some more color, if you can around how much classified grew in 2020 or some more color on bookings growth or if you can do that even relative growth versus the rest of the business. Just any kind of sense you can give us on the sort of seed corn projects that will fill out the revenue outlook in the next 3 to 5 years and beyond.
Jim Taiclet: You bet. Hi, Carter and unfortunately, I do have to be a little cryptic and I apologize for that, but I'll try to give you color to the best of my abilities. We have seen our classified business from an order book standpoint and from a sales standpoint growing faster than the corporation. If you go around the horn, I've mentioned in the past, we won a strategic program in Palmdale, where we're starting to see the benefits of multiple customers starting to -- want that system. In fact, we're also in conversation with international partner of the United States of their interest in that system and back to Mike's question, that's the reason for the capital growth out in Palmdale. There is some other things going on out there that unfortunately we can't talk about that. I think we'll reap the benefits of some of them are hypersonics, some of them are other platforms. And missiles and fire control, we've talked about the large development program that we won. It is progressing well, it's going to continue to grow in the future. Probably as fast, if not faster than the rest of missiles and fire control. And then, probably the other big place to talk is space. We won a couple rather large strategic programs in 2020, we're also pursuing a few in 2021. And also the -- from a sales standpoint, as I mentioned it for across the corporation growing faster than top line than our business in the aggregate it is. From a margin standpoint, margins in aeronautics for Palmdale the classified work right now is dilutive just by the nature of the contract types. Same with missiles and fire control, these programs are going to be dilutive -- growing faster than the rest of the portfolio, but from a margin standpoint, going to be dilutive. The good news also is, but from a contract type standpoint, they're not an impact to working capital. So there'll be a reasonably good cash flow. In the space business, some of these programs are fixed price. But most of them are going to be cost plus as well, so just slightly took dilutive to the overall portfolio. But again, I apologize that's about as much as I could say about the portfolio.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. Jim, a question for you. Given the recent share price performance and the valuation on the stock. And of course, a very low interest rates here. Do you think is the best use of the balance sheet to continue to pile up more cash and perhaps you should be more aggressive on the share buyback here?
Jim Taiclet: Well, we are balanced in our cash application and always have been as a company and it's my legacy back at my prior company as well. And there are many competing parts, right? So we have an opportunity to say and a desire to grow and we're pursuing that growth strategy while carrying for cash deployment to shareholders. So again to be a little cryptic, we've got all the keys on the piano at our disposal. And we're going to work our way through some decisions and opportunities here in the near future. But yes, I may accolade of the notion that when share prices below intrinsic value that you aggressively to the extent that you can, buy it back based on regulatory and other matters that go on. And so -- and opportunities that maybe being looked at or not and so, we'll work our way through all of those issues. But I can assure you that, if we're in the clear and intrinsic value is greater than the share price. You'll see Ken and I diving back in the market.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, Jim and Ken. Just give 3% to 4% EBIT growth this year versus 9% in 2020. How do you think about some of those drivers as it relates to your $9 billion OCF target in 2023? Is it sort of steady as it goes in terms of your earnings outlook? And then I guess the age old question of, is there an opportunity where earnings growth exceeds revenue growth going forward, given decelerating budget environment?
Jim Taiclet: Hi, good morning. I hope you're doing well, you and your family.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you very much.
Jim Taiclet: So yes, we see -- if you look at our cash and as you noted, we see 8.3 cash from ops in 2,187 before the tax impact due to R&D of -- in '22 and then $9 billion in '23. We see -- right now, we see margins pretty steady at 11%. So most of that is -- I've talked to Wall Street about our focus on cash, what we've called it is a culture of cash, where generally over the last couple of years, it's not just frankly a balance sheet, issue is not the finance community just to solve, it's the entire corporation. Where say production operations understands the consequences of making or missing deliveries and how that impacts cash. So we see more opportunities going forward, managing the balance sheet, specifically contract assets and inventory and ensuring that if they're going to grow, they're growing at the most efficient way possible. And then also, as Jim mentioned, we see opportunities. I'm not going to talk about specifically FMS, we're probably more direct government sales, where there is an opportunity for us to get cash advances. To answer your second part of your question. We do see some opportunity though to be better than 11% and that specifically our programs that will start to mature. Pick F-16, we're generally in the beginning of the production cycle again, we're going to deliver 8 airplanes in 2022 and then we will get up to significant double-digit deliveries in '23 and beyond. There is an opportunity for us to have margin improvement there. F-35, everybody wants to talk about F-35. We do still think there's opportunities there from a margin standpoint to production. We've talked to you about the PBLs concept to the performance-based logistics concept that we've had that we do think there's some margin opportunity there for industry. Assuming we perform, assuming we hit the critical service level agreements that we want. Hypersonics, we'll soon get out of development and hopefully go into limited rate production and production that will help us. All the helicopter programs that we've talked about, you'll start to see CH-53K moving at a development into production. Presidential helicopter of course is moving into production. You have combat search and rescue that are moving to production. There is just a couple of examples, Sheila, I think that will give us an opportunity to enhance our margin overtime.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Thank you. Good morning. Jim, earlier, you said that the goal would be to enrich your platforms with Mission Systems content. And I have to say, this to me sounded like something I could have heard back in the Vance Coffman Norm Augustine days, something that didn't really work out well, because of DoJ concerns, DoD concerns. So now with the -- you're trying to do that. And then also you talked about the advantages you could get from the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition. And then Raytheon with the acquisition of Blue Canyon and that's -- they make buses that do work for you guys or else for here us for Northrop Grumman. I mean, are we seeing -- do you think we're seeing a different structure to this industry going forward with much more vertical integration? Can you comment on this from sort of a philosophical standpoint?
Jim Taiclet: Sure, Doug. I mean, if you go all the way back to the primary notion that we're back into a world of great power competition. It's important to look, I think beyond our own defense industrial base structure, but outward to those of the competitors, which are China, Russia, Iran and North Korea for example. And compare our capabilities in the -- if I mean, government -- comparing our defense industrial base capabilities to those of the peer group. How is China operate its defense industrial base, how does it organize it and what are the capabilities and velocity again that comes from that? And from that perspective, my view would be that vertical integration concerns from a classic antitrust perspective, are dwarfed by the lack of velocity and inability to integrate and added cost frankly that comes from the existing defense industrial based structure that stratified with the supply chain that's quite fragmented. I think it's better for the country and for the defense enterprise to enable industry to make logical proposals for bringing in Mission Systems, if you will, the supply chain that goes into major platforms, into a more integrated organization. So, I think that's the philosophical basis. On the other hand, we cannot predict the decisions of individual regulators and those coming into office. But I do think that it's critical that those decisions look through the lens of great power competition and how we compare to the defense industrial base certainly with China.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hi, good morning everyone. How much revenue is your hypersonics franchise generating in the 2021 outlook? And then how much revenue could your hypersonics franchise be generating closer to the middle of the decade?
Jim Taiclet: Okay Noah, I'll take that. You do like these long haul answer. So I'll do the best of my abilities on the second part. But if you look at our hypersonics portfolio through 2020, our total order book was north of $3 billion. We generated about $1.2 billion in hypersonics sales in 2020 and think of that is mostly development in cost plus programs. And actually we had a couple -- risk retirements at the end of the year, so our programs are performing. For 2021, Noah, the best of our abilities, right now we see hypersonics sales being about $1.5 billion and still dilutive margins just based on contract type and the type of work that's being done. We're going to have a handful of these programs will have first launch continued demonstration of capabilities this year and next year. And then, as I've stated in the past, you will start seeing some of these programs neck-down as you saw last year where we had one program terminated, but we actually saw the funding start to go to some of our other platforms. So for us really not a harm and intuitively made sense. So by the middle of the decade, it's conceivable that, that number could be closer to $3 billion. You'll start to see some of these limited rate production programs happening. Some of these programs will actually start going into full-scale production. So it's conceivable that our sales were more than double by the middle of this decade and also the contract type will start changing and they will either be fixed price incentive or fixed price contracts.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Jim, Ken, Greg, good morning. So, I want to ask you about the international. We've known the Trump administration went to extensive measures to promote US Defense exports. I'm just wondering, maybe could dovetail off to the comments you've made, coming from your government affairs people about the new administration. Do you see any changes with how the new administration is looking at exports. Do you think there's going to be continued growth there? And do you think this could be a benefit to you or to the international sales of air defense equipment?
Jim Taiclet: Richard, it's Jim. Again it's too soon to tell what individual policy makers are going to do since they haven't been named or confirmed in large part yet. But if you go back to first principles of the administration based on -- can they [indiscernible] our President Biden's campaign, jobs and economic recovery incredibly important to him and to his administration. And there are no better source of jobs and international military sales for this country and in large part, because these are tend to be engineering stem, high salary and the manufacturing jobs also high wage, reliable, dependable jobs with companies that have strong benefits, etcetera. So, if jobs in the economy are important, the promotion of international defense sales one would -- surmise, it would also be important. So from that perspective, I expect that we're going to get strong support, let alone from as I mentioned earlier, the interest and desire to have increased collaboration and cooperation with our allies. And as the next pilot myself, I can tell you that there is no better way to get a tighter bond with an ally and then sell them jet aircraft, fighter aircraft, because all the way back in the mid '80s, when I was in pilot training, we had Saudis in our class for example. And then, when I was at Pratt & Whitney, we build in F-100 engine overhaul repair shop in Saudi Arabia that further cemented our collaboration with that country, is just two tiny examples. And then you've got again the training, collaboration, you've got industrial collaboration, you're doing exercises together, you're using the same cockpit avionics. Just goes on-and-on, how you can increase your alliance stickiness if you will with major defense sales. So, I think on those two dimensions at least that we would expect some positive momentum.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning. Just a quick one on space. It looked like there was some implied margin erosion or compression sequentially into 2021. But I would have thought that AWE would have helped that. Is there something else that moved around in the mix that you point us to?
Ken Possenriede: Sure. Hey Myles, it's Ken. Yes, the big driver is; if you look at United Launch Alliance. Due to the mix of launches, we're going to see less profit next year, a ULA then we had in 2020. But you're right, unfortunately that more than offsets the ULA. I'm sorry the AWE dilution.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. I wanted to go through some of the margins [indiscernible] aeronautics. I mean you had to increase in C-130 profits and in look like revenues change much otherwise you would have spelled it out. And then you had a reduction in the F-16 margins and it looked like you had to have an increase in the production margin on the F-35 to get these big and increases you had. So I just wonder, if you could clarify that a little bit more?
Jim Taiclet: Hey George, I got a clarifying question for you. Talking about fourth quarter of '20 or you want to talk about '21?
George Shapiro: Talk about the full year 2020.
Jim Taiclet: Full year 2020. Well, it's probably just make sense than to talk about the fourth quarter, because that's the most current information. So just in aggregate, I'll talk top line and bottom line for aeronautics. So we saw a development top line increases. Generally, they were mid-single digit increases and that was driven by a follow on modernization. I mean, we're still seeing a lot of success there, a lot of demand by our customer set for increased technology on the platform. Production was down in the quarter, year-over-year in the fourth quarter, George and that was mid-single digit as well that was probably more of a timing issue than anything else. Sustainment, we saw a strong growth and we're going to see strong growth into 2021 that will be the fastest growing piece of F-35 in 2021. We saw strong increases at -- on F-16, you're starting to see production kick in and you also had strong sustainment. C-130 sales were up 3%. So think of that is low single digits. ADP, the skunk-works is strong double-digit increases there as well. And I'll go to profit for you, so for the quarter, we were up 7%, roughly 10.8 margins versus 10.6. But F-35 to your point was down. That was driven by production, so we had high-single digit margins. I mean it was almost 10%, but down a little bit versus last year, which were stronger double-digit margins and that was just frankly driven by a less risk retirements in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019. Sustainment was up a little bit, F-16 margins for the quarter George were up. Both were double-digit margins, but fourth quarter this year we are almost 20% margins on F-16. That's because we had a risk retirement on an international sustainment program, C-130 margins were up in the fourth quarter as well and that's because we had risk retirements in our FIAC programs. And ADP was up and most of that was volume, but we actually good news had some risk retirements there as well. So hopefully that help to give you some color.
Greg Gardner: Hey Brett, it's Greg. Before I hand it off the Jim, I've been informed that some listeners might not have heard the forward-looking statement at the beginning, so Joe, let me just reiterate for a minute that statements made in today's call that are not historical fact, are considered forward-looking statements and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions. So, please check our SEC filings for more discussion on these risks and historical facts. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim for closing comments.
Jim Taiclet: Okay, great. Thanks. Look our business performed exceptionally well in 2020 under extremely difficult circumstances. And again, I want to thank the men and women of Lockheed Martin for stepping up to that. We delivered outstanding program execution and operational performance for our customers and strong financial performance for you the stockholders. So our robust backlog, our broad portfolio and our long-term strategic focus, have us well positioned for continued growth we think. So we thank you again for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. And that concludes our call today, Brad. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-20 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Possenriede, our Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2020 earnings call, as we review our financial and operational results, highlight some of our key accomplishments, and discuss our updated outlook for 2020 and trend information for 2021. I do hope this call finds you and your family safe and healthy. The coronavirus outbreak remains an ongoing global pandemic, and we're all working to mitigate its impacts. Our priorities at Lockheed Martin remain ensuring the health and welfare of our employees and their families, continuing to perform and deliver for our customers and our national security and using our resources and leadership as a company to assist our communities, our country, and our allies. We are continuing to take actions to address issues brought on by this virus: maintaining robust health and safety protocols in the workplace, delivering personal protective equipment to frontline workers, and donating over $20 million to COVID-19 charities. We have continued expediting payments to our supply chain and have hired over 12,000 employees since the pandemic began. I thank all of the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their dedication and commitment during these trying times as they perform with excellence for our customers and their important missions. I'd also like to take a moment to express my sincere sympathies to those across our nation affected by the recent hurricane and wildfire disasters. We hope that our employees and other citizens of the affected communities recover quickly from the devastation caused by these events. Moving to Lockheed Martin's results, as our press release illustrates, we delivered another strong quarter across the board financially, strategically, and operationally. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide preliminary trending data for 2021, but I'd like to begin by providing a few financial highlights from the quarter. Sales this quarter were a record and exceeded last year's third quarter by 9%. Year-to-date, we are 10% over our 2019 results. Our business areas grew segment profit by 6% over the 2019 third quarter and year-to-date were 7% over 2019. We had a strong quarter of cash generation, achieving $1.9 billion of cash from operations. We now have brought in nearly $6.4 billion of operating cash year-to-date, keeping us on pace to deliver at least $8 billion in cash from operations in 2020. We won approximately $17 billion in orders, resulting in another high watermark for our backlog and our ninth consecutive quarter of backlog growth. And in cash deployment actions during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of over 8% to $2.60 per share and $10.40 annually. Providing outstanding returns to shareholders through a strong dividend remains our cash deployment priority, and this action marks the 19th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend. Our outstanding year-to-date results and record backlog enabled us to again increase our full year 2020 outlook for sales, operating profit, and earnings per share. Our team continues to deliver exceptional performance and operating results with a portfolio that is well aligned to our customers' priorities. Turning briefly to budgets. You'll recall that the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 was enacted into law last year and established spending levels for discretionary defense budgets, with a total fiscal year 2021 national defense spending target of approximately $740 billion. Lawmakers continue to work on authorization and appropriations bills, and in the interim the federal government is operating under a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2021 through December 11. While we do not expect impacts to our 2020 financials should the continuing resolution be extended beyond December 11, 2020, we could experience some level of impact to our 2021 trending data depending on the duration of the CR. Similarly, Section 3610 of the CARES Act, which was passed in March to provide authorization for federal contractors continuing to support government initiatives despite COVID-19 disruption was also extended through December 11. To-date, no additional funding has been provided for issues introduced by the coronavirus. As with the DoD appropriations bill, we do not anticipate a material impact to our 2020 financial results should a delay in CARES Act funding continue, and we remain engaged in discussions with the Defense Department regarding a macro settlement for issues caused by the virus. Turning to our portfolio. I'd like to highlight a few of our notable strategic achievements that demonstrate the solid demand for our signature platforms and their relevancy to next-generation, war-fighting capabilities. In our Aeronautics business area, the Department of Defense announced a foreign military sale for a total of 90 new F-16 fighter aircraft to the countries of Taiwan and Morocco. Aero received an award of nearly $5 billion, adding to recent orders from Bahrain, Slovakia, and Bulgaria and bringing the F-16 backlog to nearly 130 jets. This 90-airplane award is part of a new $62 billion indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, contract vehicle put in place to facilitate F-16 FMS sales to international customers, taking advantage of standardized contracting to expedite the process for future awards. And I can tell you, I flew a Block 70 last year, and it is an awesome airplane. Our Space business area was awarded a new contract that represents an opportunity to bring together an array of high-tech platforms into one cohesive network that spans every domain for unmatched situational awareness powered with 5G technology. Last month, the Space Development Agency awarded our team one of two contracts for approximately $200 million to develop initial data transport capabilities for the first generation of the National Defense Space Architecture. The award represents an important step toward building an interoperable, connected, and secure mesh network of satellites that links ground, sea, and air capabilities to sensors in space. The Space Transport Layer contract initiates the design and development of the system, the launch of a constellation of 10 small low Earth-orbiting satellites, and this network will be capable of sending and receiving secure wideband data directly to the war fighter and to weapon systems. This interoperability and interservice networking will communicate and analyze data seamlessly to enable a force multiplier that's flexible and formidable, so that those in battle can effectively perform joint all-domain operations. Future sensors, data collectors, and communication payloads can be incrementally added to this constellation to create a web that will link the most time-critical intelligence and tracking data. We are very pleased to be part of this opportunity and look forward to the launch of the satellites and the demonstration of the initial mesh network in just two years. In our Missiles and Fire Control group, our integrated air and missile defense team achieved two important mission success events. These demonstrated our commitment to innovation and a network-centric focus at Lockheed Martin. Most recently, we successfully conducted a test at White Sands, just after the close of the quarter, where a PAC-3 MSE missile intercepted an incoming target using location data provided by the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense network or THAAD weapon system. This demonstrated a critical capability to expand the defended area through integration of existing systems. In July, the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin together demonstrated the ability to integrate F-35 intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance track data with the U.S. Army's integrated Battle Command System, during an Orange Flag Evaluation near Edwards Air Force Base, California. This valuation just demonstrated the value of utilizing data from the F-35 to enable enhanced integrated air and missile defense such as PAC-3 engagements. This accomplishment is one of the first instances of demonstrating our 5G.mil concept. With the F-35's compute and data storage capabilities enabling that F-35 to serve as an edge node of a network-centric operational architecture. This concept and the ability to share data across platforms is another example of our commitment to adopting a joint all-domain operations mindset to maximize the collective value and power of our customers' highly capable assets and our platforms. Networking every sensor with every shooter across the services and across domains will provide real-time data to maximize the effectiveness of our total force. These few strategic highlights represent just a few of how we will pursue a strategy to help our customers meet emerging threats with 21st century capabilities as well as create a powerful deterrent to future military conflicts. We continue to engage industry as well as technology leaders from the commercial sector to explore collaboration and align technology road maps for transformational solutions for our men and women in uniform. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken.
Ken Possenriede: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share remain strong. And as Jim noted, we achieved record sales in the quarter. We generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our cash deployment actions in the quarter, returning $757 million of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In addition to these results, we again increased our backlog to $150.4 billion, representing the ninth consecutive quarter of record backlog. And based on the strength of our performance to date, we have updated our financial outlook for 2020 and are also providing our 2021 preliminary financial trends. Turning to chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the third quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% compared with last year to a record $16.5 billion, continuing the strength we had in the first two quarters, while segment operating profit increased 6% over last year's level to nearly $1.8 billion. On chart 5, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS from continuing operations was $6.25, an increase of $0.59 or 10% higher than last year, driven by a $100 million increase in segment operating profit and additional FAS/CAS income, partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate. On chart 6, we review our year-to-date cash from operations. Through three quarters, our cash from operations is $6.4 billion, a 10% increase over the same point in 2019. This performance does include $1.4 billion of CARES Act benefits, which were more than offset by $1.8 billion of accelerated payments to our suppliers. Moving on to chart 7, we provide our revised outlook for 2020. With just one quarter left in the year, we are now providing point estimates of results for the entire year versus the ranges we have provided in previous quarters. We expect sales to be approximately $65.3 billion for the year. That's above the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. At $7.1 billion our forecasted segment operating profit is also above the high end of the guidance range last quarter, maintaining a 10.9% margin. This puts our sales approximately 9% above our 2019 results and segment operating profit approximately 8% last year. Our FAS/CAS pension adjustment remains unchanged at a little less than $2.1 billion. Earnings per share is expected to be approximately $24.45 above the high end of our previous guidance range driven by additional sales volume and the continued performance across our business. And cash from operations remains at greater than or equal to $8 billion, which assumes no contributions to our pension trust in 2020. Chart 8 shows our new outlook for sales by business area for the year. In total our point estimate for sales outlook is approximately $1 billion above the midpoint of our last guidance and that's driven primarily by Aeronautics. On chart 9 we provide a similar view of our new outlook for segment operating profit by business area for the year. Like our sales, segment operating profit is $150 million above the midpoint of the guidance range from last quarter and that's driven primarily by Aeronautics and RMS. On Chart 10, we provide a preliminary look at our 2021 trends. As we look ahead, we expect our 2021 sales to be greater than or equal to $67 billion, a 3% increase over our current outlook for 2020. We expect our segment operating margin will be between 10.9% and 11.1%, showing continued strong performance on our legacy programs in all business areas. And as you recall from last quarter, we expected 2021 cash to be at least $7.8 billion, including a $1 billion contribution to our pension trust. We are now pleased to increase that estimate by $300 million to $8.1 billion still including the same $1 billion pension payment. We also plan at least $1 billion in share repurchases, the same level as we anticipate in 2020 and that's more than offsetting any expected share issuances in the year. And additionally we have a debt maturity coming due next year of $500 million. Moving to our FAS/CAS outlook. We expect our net 2021 FAS/CAS adjustment will be approximately $2.1 billion and that's similar to the adjustment for 2020. This estimate assumes a discount rate at the end of the year of 2.5% or 75 basis points below the 2019 rate. And based on our performance to date, we are assuming a 7% return on our assets for 2020 and we are maintaining that same rate of 7% per year for our long-term asset return assumption. And finally on chart 11, we have our summary. We have seen growth and strong performance from all our business areas this year with increased backlog and sustained cash generation throughout the year. Our updated 2020 financial metrics anticipate strong full year results and we expect to see continued operational performance and increased cash flows in 2021. Based on our portfolio of legacy programs, new wins and strategic investments in key growth areas, we have continued to grow our backlog, deliver value to our customers and return cash to our stockholders. And with that, we're ready for your questions. John?
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen at this time, we are opening our lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Thanks so much, and good morning Jim and Ken.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Revenues have grown 30% since 2017, and if we exclude the F-35, volumes are up 17%, so high single-digit growth per year. What programs or product areas do you think decelerate the most in your view from these high-single-digit levels to 3% implied trend line for 2021? And then is this something of a new normal we should be thinking about or do we transition from platform programs to less quantifiable opportunities that could reshape the growth curve? Thank you.
Ken Possenriede: Thanks Sheila. I'll tell you what, I'll kick it off and then I'll ask Jim if he's got some color at the end. So, it's probably best we start with how we got to this trend data. So, if you think of our planning process over the last couple of months, we've been going through our long-range plan, working with our business areas, and then working with the corporation on assumptions regarding tax or pension assumptions et cetera. We then review that with our Board, and it's primarily a reaffirmation of our 2020 numbers and then the long-range plan for 2021 through 2023. Do that in the late September time period. The quarter closes, we then do an assessment to come up with what we think our trend data will be. And I'll just remind everybody and we've said it in our prepared comments, Jim and I we did take our guidance up $1 billion for 2020. So if I could go around the horn. I'll do sales go around the horn, and then I'll give you some -- my perspective on some opportunities out there and then hand it over to Jim. So we start with Aero, and we look at 2021. Right now, we're seeing low-single-digit growth year-over-year for the portfolio. And specifically, if you talk about F-35, we're seeing growth similar to the overall Aero growth of low-single digits. Right now, we see production and development flat and we see primarily the growth coming from sustainment as our fleet expands. On F-16, we see solid growth as the program continues to ramp up production activities and also the modernization programs that we have going on at -- for F-16. Air mobility sales surprisingly are flattish. We've been talking about a slight decline, but they are stable going into 2021. And finally for Aeronautics, we do anticipate seeing strong double-digit growth at our Skunk Works, our classified Advanced Development Programs. We continue to execute on those recent awards. If I move on to Missiles and Fire Control, we're seeing low-single-digit growth there as well, and that's after several years of very strong growth as we approach production capacity on some major missile programs. Think of Hellfire and GMLRS. We're still seeing very strong demand there, but just year-over-year we see it being more flattish than not. Our growth is being led by our production programs, think PAC-3, which will be up double-digits. Precision fires will be up mid-single digits and JASSM-LRASM will be up double digits. That's partially offsetting some of the growth in our THAAD programs and that's just due to some procurement cost timing on a multi-year award. If I could move to RMS, we also anticipate low-single-digit growth there as well at least for now. At Sikorsky, we're seeing low-single-digit growth, and that's a reflection of the mix across our production programs as life cycles change. So think of the Combat Rescue Helicopter program and CH-53K, we'll see double-digit growth there as these programs ramp up into production, that’s partially offset the growth at VH-92 as it ramps down and lower volumes on our Canadian military helicopter program, and the same with Black Hawk even though it's a strong contributor, and the top line year-over-year we'll see a modest decline. Within IWSS, we'll see a slight decline from 2021. Our Aegis franchise, however, will see high-single-digit growth and that's driven by international opportunities, so we're still seeing international opportunities there. Offsetting that growth, we're seeing reductions within our Radar business as the TPQ declines, while we await the next-gen programs. Think of Sentinel and TPY-X beyond 2021, and we're also seeing lower volume on our Littoral Combat Ship program in 2021. Nice surprise in RMS is our training solutions. We're going to see solid double-digit growth there driven by digital percentage of POT events in 2021 on an international pilot training program. And then finally Space, it will be -- right now we see it as our highest growth business area, mid single-digit range. Think of that as the strategic missile defense portfolio is expected to be up double digits. That's mainly driven by hypersonics programs and then also the anticipated next-generation interceptor award, and that's partially offset by the growth and reductions on our legacy MIL space programs, and predominantly think SBIRS, Advanced EHF, and GPS, they're all down mid-single digits due to program life cycle. So we'll go into January, we'll spend the next three months going through the second phase of our plan, and a couple of things before we give guidance, we'll see how we ended 2020, how we finish the year. We'll then reassess our orders plan for 2021 and adjust that accordingly and its impact that it has on our 2021 top line growth for sales. And then, we'll look at our backlog and look at the assumptions that our business areas are making of conversions to sales in 2021. And before I turn the call over to Jim, just some orders opportunities that are out there. We still see continued need and demand for additional capabilities on F-35 that ultimately down the road maybe not in 2021, but we'll see some growth there in the future. There are certainly other countries that have a keen interest in the F-35 from a product standpoint. So we'll see demand there. F-16, Jim mentioned the IDIQ contract, we received the first two countries that are part of that IDIQ. We see many opportunities out there for F-16, and the same with C-130. And then in the classified area of Aeronautics, there are a multitude of opportunities out there. In Missiles and Fire Control, we have TLVS. That's a future air and missile defense program for Germany. There's upside there for us. CH-53K in RMS for international. Of course, we've always talked about the Future Vertical Lift. And then in space, there's classified space. And then most of these are platform programs Sheila. There are others. We're looking to focus on our mission systems. Jim talked about the 5G work and the interconnectivity of our products solution for our customer, and I'll let him give some more color on that if he has it.
Jim Taiclet: Sure Ken. That was a great summary of some of the detailed line items that go into 2021. But Sheila, I would just add and extend from what Ken said on some themes for growth over the next -- not only the next year, but the next number of years. So the way I'm looking at it is that as Ken said, there's high demand for our signature products already both domestic and international whether it's F-35, F-16, CH-53K, et cetera. And we are going to drive some mission systems content into those as we move forward and technology, insertion and upgrades as was mentioned briefly. But those are some really big themes. We don't know exactly what customer and what order and what version they're going to be seeking and what the quarter, but I assure you these themes are going to continue. The next theme, I would offer is, there's some new technology ramps to production that Ken alluded to, but when we speak of hypersonics, I think there's a very big upside there, because there's a very big threat that's getting worse out of Russia and China and the U.S. and its allies are going to have to meet it both on offensive and defensive hypersonics systems, which I believe we're the leader here. The classified space arena is really a wide open field. Our Space business is again the clear leader in this area. And we're putting out some really fantastic products, I think that are unmatched in our industry. And then there's Future Vertical Lift as Ken said. And keep that in mind because as we go to network-centric operations, which I just alluded to a couple of examples that we've already implemented – as we go to that network-centric approach more widely, it's really going to strengthen our platform positions of those signature platforms. So think of Aegis, F-35, Future Vertical Lift, whether it's DEFIANT or not. Those are going to be the edge compute nodes of the future and the processing systems that act as the core network that tie it all together. So our platforms are extremely well positioned to actually implement the sort of 5G.military that we have that we're pursuing. And then there's going to be new revenue streams. I think as a result of 5G.mil and our kind of 21st century warfighter concept, and those could be inclusive of networking-as-a-service, more of a subscription model that we do on behalf of our customers. And then we do the upgrades and the comm layer and make sure we tie it all together just like you experience on your cellphone subscription. You don't know all the pieces that go into it. So every morning when you turn it on it works and it works with the latest applications and it works with the latest technology. So those are the kinds of things we're going to explore. It will take a little bit longer to get there but we're positioning ourselves to do that as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks, good morning. First one is just a clarification for Ken and your remarks on backlog. You mentioned some of the opportunities, but I didn't hear if you thought it would end the year flat up or down. And then Jim, if we take everything that Ken laid out from a cash and capital deployment with respect to the $1 billion share repurchase and then debt retirements about $1 billion a year, you'll have maybe $6 billion this time next year and a business that requires $1.5 billion to $2 billion on hand. So it's going to continue to raise the question of how you're progressing looking at potential opportunities, particularly in the M&A arena. So hoping you can give some perspective there as you've looked a little bit deeper from your time. Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: So – hey, Myles. Good morning. So first question on the backlog. We are right now planning on growing our backlog in the fourth quarter. There is one binary event that has to happen and that is the closure on Lot 15 production. We're in the midst of negotiations with the customer right now. I think there's agreement on both sides to try to get this done by year-end. But if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen and it rolls into next year. But if it does happen, we will continue the growth in the fourth quarter of backlog increase.
Jim Taiclet: And so Myles to speak to M&A approaches, I think we actually have to take two levels up and speak first to the strategy for the company. The executive team and I and the Board agree on what we call our 21st century warfighter concept, which has four pillars to the strategy. And I'll go through them really briefly. But first of all it's lead. We want to lead the acceleration of 21st technology – century technologies into the national defense space, not just by doing it ourselves but by teaming with commercial industry and things like AI, 5G, edge computing, autonomy, additive manufacturing et cetera. So we're planning to lead that acceleration into 21st century technologies. We're going to innovate as a second pillar internally along with that. So we're going to innovate in both the realms of science such as directed energy, hypersonics, I mentioned earlier, as well as in this networking innovation and bring capabilities to our platforms and frankly our – ultimately our competitors' platforms to be able to make them all more effective on behalf of our customer. The third pillar of all of this is driving operational excellence. And so that's really about while doing all this increasing Lockheed Martin's margins and ROI, while reducing the total life cycle cost for our customers because for them to afford what they need to do in the future our industry actually has to get more efficient at the same time. And then lastly, and this is where we get into more of capital allocation, we believe in this business and we're seeking to invest in it for growth. So growth of our asset base, our capabilities is sort of the fourth pillar and that's going to provide solutions to our customers that they're going to need in the future that we can't necessarily deliver today. So when we take those four pillars and say, okay, well what are we going to do with capital allocation and all that cash that this really fantastic business is generating as you said, it's really first of all to support our strong dividend. We're going to continue to do that. And secondly, we're going to keep investing in organic capital expenditures to build capacity to deliver on our core business. Much of what we spent this year is on classified programs in both Aeronautics and Space that are growing relatively rapidly. And so we're going to continue to do those organic investments every time we can. Thirdly, alongside those CapEx investments, we're going to invest in R&D to sustain our technological leadership. And again, both in traditional or defense-centric areas, such as hypersonics and also is more commercially introduced areas such as networking. So those are the first three: it's a dividend, CapEx and R&D. But we're also going to seek acquisition and joint venture opportunities to deepen our capabilities in things like mission systems, as Ken said, and to add technological firepower to our existing company. For example, we just bought a business called i3 that gives us a novel capability and thermal management for hypersonic glide bodies, which is something we wanted to bring in-house and again accelerate our own potential for developing that piece of the technology that's so absolutely critical. And so we're going to be looking for opportunities in the M&A space and the joint venture space and even partnerships that are commercial to thicken our portfolio and also to bring in the technologies faster into the company that we think are going to be crucial for the future. So we plan to be active but we also plan to be very, very prudent. In my last business experience, we were fairly active on the M&A front but we turned down actually quite a few more opportunities than we went through with. So we'll continue to have that discipline here at Lockheed Martin, but we do want to invest in this company and grow and use our cash flow to do that when we can.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Safran with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Rich Safran: Jim, Ken, Greg, good morning.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Rich Safran: So a space question with about three parts. Margins at Space were a bit weaker than I thought. And I'm guessing, there was an issue there at ULA. So I thought you might discuss that. Next, we're talking about 2021. I thought you might discuss the competitive dynamics in the Space business. Does SpaceX represent a challenge to your plans? And given the remarks you just made, do you think contested space is a growth area next year? Finally, here Jim, I thought you might expand on the opening remarks about the new satellite constellation. And if it's applicable discuss generally the long-term space opportunity set here? And if the 21st century warfighter program you just mentioned is involved.
Ken Possenriede: Okay. Hey, Rich, that sounded like a four part question. I'm not good at math. So, yeah regarding the margin reduction on Space. It's based on a couple of things. One, we had one less event on ULA. There was a slip in one of the launches. So that was the main driver. But you also had lower risk retirements on advanced EHF and fleet ballistic missile in 2020 compared to 2019. Regarding SpaceX and then I'll let Jim chime in. We at ULA – we Boeing and the United Launch Alliance leadership team we have seen SpaceX as an emerging threat. I mean, they are more than an emerging threat right now. But what I would say is of the recent competitions we've had with them, we've actually been pleased with the outcome of where ULA landed relative to SpaceX. So I think going forward, we're confident that we certainly have the mission capable abilities, but we also think we now have a price point that is compelling to customers that will allow ULA to get its fair share of awards over SpaceX. I don't know, Jim, if you want to talk about the next two.
Jim Taiclet: Sure. When it comes to test and space all I'll say is that, there are kinetic and non-kinetic emerging threats to space on orbit space assets and even ground stations and the links between them. And so as a prudent national defense, I think our government is going to need to understand and work with the industry on how to address those kinds of threats and so I'll leave it there. But those threats are emerging and they're becoming more material. When it comes to the new satellite constellation, this is to me coming from the telecom and technology sector, the real cracking open up the door of having a multi-layer, multi-lateral survival communications system that can enable a 5G.MIL concept that we're working with. So I think it was a real breakthrough for Rick Ambrose and his business to win a big part of that it's called the transport layer as I said. And what that does is put a low-orbit constellation similar to what you're hearing about in the commercial sector that we'll be able to transmit 5G speed, capacity and latency signals between really all domains now. So it'd be into upper space orbits down to aircraft in the air to ground troops and vehicles to ship-borne operations and theoretically and potentially even to undersea. So this transport layer is sort of one of the first elements of what we would envision in the future as 5G.MIL architecture and so we're right in the middle of designing that now with our customers. So yeah, it's an important piece. There'll be more competition. This will be a competitive space, but we want to get out in front of it. And I think the Space business area of Lockheed Martin gives us a huge advantage over really anyone else in taking the lead in this.
Operator: And next we'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Can you hear me? 
Ken Possenriede: Yes. Hi, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Okay. Hello. Ken, I thought you had been pretty consistent for a while here that MFC would remain the fastest-growing segment of the company through – for a few more years. And you've just – recognizing that the dispersion of the growth rates you just guided to for revenue in 2021 by segment is pretty tight you didn't guide it to be the fastest-growing segment and it's a meaningful deceleration from 2020. So what's changed there if anything, or do you just have conservatism built into that? And then on the margin in that segment following that coming down for a few years now with the mix shift. Is that bottoming in 2020, or any color on the margin going forward in that segment would be helpful as well.
Ken Possenriede: You bet. Thanks Noah for the question. Yeah there's a couple of things. Let's talk top line, there's a couple of things going on. So as I mentioned, when Sheila opened up the call with the question on where we saw slowness of growth some of it is just – some of our tactical strike missile programs are at capacity right now. So think of Hellfire and GMLRS. You have a little bit of a timing issue with THAAD. But going forward, we see growth with THAAD. The growth opportunities for Missiles and Fire Control down the road will be PAC-3, and precision fires for the most part, because of the – they are not at capacity and we are seeing extremely strong demand internationally and domestically for that product. And what we didn't talk about in the development phase still is the large classified program that we have. We will start to see in the next four to five years that go into a limited rate production and then ultimately into production and you will see a large increase there as well. So I think – I think you see – I think you see at least in the short term some of the areas are going to be capped by capacity, but we'll work with our customer based on the strong demand that we see does it make sense for – to us to increase our capacity for say Hellfire’s for example. Regarding margins, for 2021, we actually do see it's a slight decline to margins in 2021 and I do mean slight. And as we've talked about it before and I just mentioned it with that development program as it continues to grow at the topline, we'll see dilution there. That's the main reason. But -- so think of margins as a slight dilution in 2021.
Operator: And next we go to the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning, guys.
Jim Taiclet: Good morning.
Ron Epstein: Jim I just have a quick question for you back on the technology stuff. Back in -- it was a couple of weeks ago DoD announced their 5G experimentation and testing at five different installations. And I was surprised to learn that Lockheed wasn't part of that given what you've been saying lately. Can you talk about that like what you think about that? And is that an area that Lockheed would be interested in or is that just something that the company is not interested in?
Jim Taiclet: Well, there's two concepts around 5G. One is standard communications activity. So, terrestrial, if you will commercial communications. So, what is generally going on in the programs awarded that you're referring to is certain bases or ranges are going to have a standard terrestrial 5G implementation on those bases and ranges. That's not so much what we're interested in. We're interested in operationalizing the technical capabilities of 5G wave forms and technology software and hardware to improve our defense products and our defense products' performance in an inter-related way. So, that's a derivative of having the network in place. At a base level that's not going to really deliver what we're looking for. We need a global 5G connectivity platform and that's why space is so important an element of this. It's also why our airborne platforms will likely have a big role as well because we need edge compute nodes and edge transmission points to be able to get into battle outside of the bases if you will. So, we're really talking more about how do you go to war on a battlefield and bring with you and have available to you the throughput of data, the latency benefits, and the ability to do software-defined networks and manage spectrum dynamically on a battlefield. That's really what we're after and that will improve our national defense. 
Operator: And next we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you so much for all the great information you're given us. So, cash flow, you expect cash flow from ops up $100 million next year even though it looks like you have a headwind in pension of about $1 billion, you have a headwind in terms of payroll tax deferrals looks like $500 million. Sort of what are the drivers to get you up? What's happening to CapEx? How much is that going to come down? And maybe give us some color if you could in terms of the relative direction in 2022. Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: You bet Cai. Good morning. Yes, so we've been embarking on what I'll call a culture of cash for quite some time now and we are actually starting to see the fruits of that effort Cai. And to your point what we're seeing in 2021 as I stated in my prepared comments I gave you all some color on 2021, 2022 on our last call. So, here's what we're seeing now. It's -- obviously the farther out we go the little less granular it is. But to the best of our abilities by doing long-range plan, balance sheets, and cash flow statements what we're seeing right now is as you stated $8.1 billion of cash from operations in 2021 which as we stated is $300 million above the outlook we talked about earlier. Right now we're seeing CapEx in 2021 at about $1.7 billion. That's fairly consistent with what we're seeing this year. And as you mentioned we've got the payroll tax holiday this year. It's a tailwind of $460 million. And we're also getting the benefit of about $750 million $800 million by the end of the year of the acceleration of the progress payment rate from 90% -- excuse me 80% to 90%. We are going to accelerate all of those benefits that we got from the government to our supply chain. So, we will be whole -- we'll have the government whole in 2020 with those benefits we received. So, we do have -- with that payroll tax we do have a headwind. 50% of that $460 million gets paid next year. So, that is a headwind. And then the other half gets paid out in 2022. As you state, we do have $1 billion pension contribution next year. In the following year, what we're seeing in 2022 is we now see a number closer to $8.2 billion. We gave you a little color in the last call. We were at $7.9 billion, so another $300 million improvement on cash from operations. We see CapEx today based on what we know today in terms of our capacity requirements and infrastructure builds and whatnot $1.7 billion in 2022. So CapEx will be roughly $1.7 billion from 2020 to 2022. And actually, I'll go out to 2023 we think CapEx right now is about $1.7 billion. So we have that other headwind as we mentioned on payroll tax in 2022, and we have the pension payment of about – it's about $1.7 billion out in 2022. So I think pre-pension payment our cash from operations right now in 2022 is about $10 billion. Now the only other wildcard in all this is we've talked about the change in the R&D tax assumptions where we're no longer expensing R&D out in 2022 and beyond. We're amortizing it. So that assumption would reduce our cash from operations out in 2022 by $2.1 billion. Out in 2023 we see cash from operations of greater than or equal to $8.3 billion so another $100 million increase from where we see 2022. I mentioned, our CapEx at about $1.7 billion. Right now, we're forecasting a pension contribution of roughly $1.7 billion. And the R&D impact goes down from $2.1 billion it will be about $1.8 billion out in that time period. So we have spent a lot of effort on our working capital improvements. And to be frank Cai, we think certainly in contract assets we have some opportunities still to hopefully improve these numbers.
Operator: And our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Thank you. Good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Doug Harned: I have a two part question on the F-35. When you look at the President's budgets, they keep taking down numbers for the F-35 Congress keeps adding some back and at the same time you've got some growing international opportunities, which you've talked about. But those don't come immediately. So one would think a more stable trajectory would be helpful here. So how do you plan production around this kind of scenario? And as we see more growth coming from sustainment, how do you think that will affect your margin trajectory on the F-35?
Jim Taiclet: So I’ll take that, Doug. Yes, so right now because of COVID impacts, we've started the year, roughly we thought we were going to deliver about 140 aircraft this year. They are predominantly Lot 12 airplanes, so that's the first lot of our block buy. So right now, the team is forecasting rough numbers 120 to 125. It's still a little bit in flux, but that's our outlook right now.  Right now based on what we're seeing and working with our supply chain and working with our production operations team, we're out looking roughly 140 aircraft deliveries out in 2021. We think based on the demand we have with Lot 12, 13, 14 and ultimately I talked about the Lot 15, production lot order that we're hopeful we'll get at the end of this quarter, we see about 169. So let's just round up to 170 aircraft delivered out in the 2022 time period. And then out in 2023, we see similar about 170 aircraft. That's basically predicated on the United States government program of record.  Earlier year, we had some to your point congressional adds, but we're not assuming any congressional adds at least today once you get beyond 2021. There is still pent-up demand with our partner countries, our FMS customers demand. And then as you stated Doug, out in that time period, there are other interests for the airplane with our partner countries, existing FMS countries and there are some new potential FMS countries that potentially will buy aircraft, but it'll be beyond the 2023 time period. So I think we have a pretty good handle out to about 2022, 2023 where we think our production is going to be.  Regarding margins, it really comes down to the PBL. Right now just based on how the customer is buying, sustainment they are, it is dilutive to the overall F-35 portfolio. Where we do see opportunities is in production. We do think if we continue to perform, continue to weed out inefficiencies and hopefully negotiate a deal where the customer rewards us for that. There is production opportunities, but it comes down to the PBL. And we do believe, we are starting to get more and more interest from the customer for a PBL or performance-based logistics concept and that would have us taking on investment as the industry taking on investment risk and it would then give us the opportunity assuming we perform and hit the service level agreements we'll sign up to -- for that to be margin-accretive. 
Operator: And next we'll go to Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: Thank you and good almost afternoon. Question about sort of CapEx environment you're operating in. As you can see there's a lot of focus on your growth rates especially deceleration from 2020 growth to 2021 growth at least how you see it now. But at the same time, CapEx is remaining at this $1.7 billion level, you said 2021, '22 '23.  So even though there seems to be an assumption that growth rates and opportunities are slowing down you're still spending a lot more CapEx than you were almost ever. So how do we sort of square those two things? And is the industry or the customer I should say offering you enough certainty to be spending that CapEx such that you now have the long-term payoff that we're all looking for? 
Ken Possenriede: Thanks. Hi, Jon. Almost good afternoon. So I'll -- it's Ken, I'll take that. So if you go around the portfolio, we are still seeing demand for CapEx. And then there's one point I'll make and I'll hand it to Jim because he may have a comment on this as well. But if you think Aeronautics, we have slowed down our capitalization spend on F-35 because of COVID. But if we're still going to ramp up to those higher quantities that I described when Doug asked me the question on F-35, we are going to have to still build out our capacity on F-35.  The same with F-16. Jim mentioned our backlog right now is 130 aircraft. We're going to deliver our first airplane roughly beginning of 2022. Rough numbers we'll do about eight a year. And then ultimately by the time we get out to the middle of this decade, we'll be delivering three to four F-16s a month. So we will have to build out that capacity.  And then we've talked about the classified win in Palmdale, we still need to build the building out there. And we are hopeful that performing on that program, there are other customers that have a keen interest in that program and that's one of the opportunities I talked about when Sheila asked the question. There are opportunities out there for us that just frankly aren't planned right now.  If you look at Missiles and Fire Control, we are still building out capacity for PAC-3 though we're not building it out for say Hellfire or GMLRS. We'll talk to the customer. We feel very good about the PAC-3 build-out for example. We do see opportunities for 500-plus PAC-3s per year and potentially significantly more than that. The question then is does -- is it the right time for us to continue building out in excess of the 500 per year that we are going to build out.  Space, we have the state-of-the-art Gateway Center. And there are some other opportunities out there where we have to spend capital. And then RMS, they've done a very nice job of portfolio-shaping. That is the place we really don't see a lot of facilitization or increased capital.  One thing Jim has tasked us on and we're in the middle of doing this not just for capital, but IRAD and then other investments are there low-hanging fruit if you will where it does it make sense for us to spend that capital or our IRAD. And then are there places where we should be investing regarding 21st century warfighter, the digitalization effort that we're trying to take on. So though we may stay at the same level, the balance or the mix of our spend may change over time.
Jim Taiclet: Just the one comment I'd add to that is, we are raising the capital expense decision-making process a level and we're going to be looking across all the business areas simultaneously and doing the rank ordering at that level, which will may result in some adjustments as Ken suggested. And also, I would highlight the digital transformation side of this which is both in the factory offices and functions. That's going to help us meet our customers' needs on one hand, but it's also going to help us improve margins on the other hand and be more efficient internally as we do all of this. So, there's investment upfront for that as well. But it's going to have a dual benefit.
Operator: And our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. I think, Ken, you mentioned a little bit earlier the profitability expectation for Missiles and Fire Control in 2021. Can you just walk us through the other segments real quick?
Ken Possenriede: You bet. Thanks, Seth. I think, we're at the afternoon now. Yes so, at Aeronautics, we're actually -- we expect a slight improvement in margins from 2020, which we're very pleased with. F-35 margins and the balance of our compact -- combat air margins are expected to increase and that's consistent with our overall margins. And we expect fairly consistent margins in 2021 on air mobility. The combat air and air mobility margin improvements more than offset the dilution because you would expect just where the Skunk Works is that they would be dilutive. And I mentioned Missiles and Fire Control, so I'll move on to RMS. We're happy to see returns to double-digit margins this year and we expect a slight improvement in 2021 which we're very pleased with, so all that integration work that we've talked about. We talked about the portfolio shaping that we're doing at RMS. We're starting to see the results there. Sikorsky is the primary driver. They'll have year-over-year improvements on production programs. Think of those set as Blackhawk VH-92 and CRH. And then lastly at Space, we'll see a little bit of an erosion in margins in 2021. And that's very similar to Missiles and Fire Control. You're seeing dilution due to the OPIR development program and also increased development content at strategic missiles and missile defense portfolio. Think of that as hypersonics and then the next-generation interceptor. So, thanks for the question.
Jim Taiclet: So it's Jim. I'll end the session today by reiterating that Lockheed Martin completed another quarter of strong financial and operational performance. And with that robust backlog, focus on our program execution and strong demand for the portfolio of products and services we have -- we're positioned for a successful closure of 2020 and continued growth in 2021. So, thank you all again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call which will be in January. That concludes the call. John, thank you.
Operator: Yes. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-21 11:00:00) =====

James Taiclet: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It's a pleasure to be here on my first Lockheed Martin’s earnings call, and I look forward to working with all of you. I hope this call finds you and your families safe and healthy. The world continues to combat the coronavirus outbreak while it is striving to recover and sustain economic activity. Our primary objective at Lockheed Martin is to ensure the health and welfare of our employees and their families, our teammates, customers, and communities. We remain vigilant taking the necessary steps to help protect our workforce while producing the products and solutions our customers need to achieve their important readiness objectives. Our business areas have taken actions including implementing alternative work schedules, health and safety checks at our facilities, and telework wherever possible. Most recently, our Aeronautics team established a rotational facility plan for our F-35 production line, allowing us to continue to manufacture the aircraft while practicing social distancing and completing regular deep cleanings. The corporation also continues to support our critical industrial base suppliers, frontline medical workers, and our local communities with COVID-19 relief and response. In March, the Department of Defense announced it would increase progress payment rates to large businesses from 80% to 90% accelerating payments for the completion of work in recognition of the challenges posed by COVID-19. The DoD’s expectation was that prime contractors would flow these accelerated payments to the supply chain. Through the second quarter Lockheed Martin has flowed all of the accelerated payments the corporation has received from the Department of Defense, $1.3 billion in total to our supply chain. In this process, we've given priority to small and vulnerable suppliers as we continue our efforts to promote a healthy and sustainable defense industrial base. We've also continued to support our local communities and to date have made substantial donations to non-profit organizations involved in COVID-19 related relief and assistance with emphasis on veterans and military families. And as a global organization employing thousands across the world, we are supporting related initiatives in 15 different countries, including donations to food banks, healthcare facilities, distance learning, and research efforts to help combat this disease. This corporation has hired more than 9,000 new employees across United States since the crisis began and is advertising for another 3,000 positions. We remain on track with plans to hire approximately 12,000 employees during 2020. And across the country, we produced more than 65,000 protective gowns and 30,000 face shields, and we've donated PPE at 174 locations where frontline medical workers are caring for COVID-19 patients and others of risk. Through all these initiatives, Lockheed Martin remains committed to supporting our employees, our suppliers, and communities in which our company operates through the course of this ongoing pandemic. Ken will review our first quarter financials and updated full-year outlook in more detail in a few minutes. As you've seen from our press release, we had a very strong quarter financially despite the effects of the coronavirus. Mitigation plans put in place by each of our business areas, their teammates and supply chain, the international community, as well as strong support from the Department of Defense and broad U.S. government actions have allowed us to minimize the financial impacts on our company. This coupled with outstanding operational performance have enabled us to increase our full year outlook for sales, earnings, EPS, and cash from operations. Sales in the quarter were 12% greater than last year, as all the four business areas increased from 2019. Our segment operating profit results were also strong, growing 15% year-over-year, driven by both higher sales growth and an increase in segment profit margin to 11%. We had a strong quarter of cash generation, bringing in over $2.2 billion of cash from operations and executed our balanced cash deployment strategy. Moving to new business activities, we received nearly $22 billion in orders this quarter, raising our backlog to over $150 billion, a new high watermark. Our Aeronautics business area led the company with over $9 billion of orders, including $7 billion of total orders booked for the F-35. We were able to add 84 jets to the program with the finalization of two Lot 14 production contracts, bringing the current number of planes in our backlog to 411 aircraft. Our F-35 team also added approximately $1 billion in combined sustainment and development awards this quarter as well. Missiles and Fire Control also had a strong quarter, with the Defense Department announcing several PAC-3 awards, including one for over $6 billion to supply PAC-3 MSE interceptors, launcher modification kits, and associated equipment to support the United States and foreign military sales customers across multiple contract years. These awards demonstrate the global demand for PAC-3 MSE interceptors and to meet that demand this year, we began work on an 85,000 square foot building expansion at our Camden, Arkansas facility. The building is expected to be completed by fourth quarter 2021 with operations they're beginning in the first quarter of 2022.  Our Rotary and Mission Systems secured orders of over $1 billion to support and supply 24 MH-60 Romeo helicopters to the Government of India. These Sikorsky SEAHAWK aircraft will provide Maritime Anti-Surface and Anti-Submarine Warfare capabilities to India, as well as cargo, utility, and search and rescue missions. And our Space business area added multiple orders including a classified award for over $1 billion. In total, the corporation grew orders 23% above second quarter 2019 and achieved a companywide book-to-bill ratio of nearly 1.4 for the quarter. I'll touch briefly now on the Department of Defense budgets as both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have completed the respective markups of the fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. Each version adheres to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 spending targets and equal approximately $740 billion for national defense. Appropriation committees from each chamber are in the process of drafting the funding legislation to accompany the authorization. There are encouraging elements for our portfolio as the Senate version confirmed that the national defense strategy remains the roadmap for the armed services, and the bill was passed with strong bipartisan support. Our portfolio was well supported in the Senate version for the recommended increase of 16 F-35 aircraft above the President's request, additional funding for Missile Defense priorities including an 8 THAAD battery, and increased funding for the Homeland Defense Radar-Hawaii program. Congress will continue with the authorization and appropriation phases. We look forward to the finalization of the process and supporting our warfighters needs. Moving on, I’d like to highlight several significant events that occurred across the corporation during the past quarter. Beginning with Aeronautics, the F-35 team achieved another operational milestone, as our United Kingdom partner celebrated the initial carrier deployment of its 617 Squadron. This legendary unit, known as the Dambusters from their exploits in World War II is now aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier. The Squadron will now begin a series of flight trials demonstrating the jets ability to defend the carrier who Combat Air Patrols, rapid deployment and interoperability with other U.K. Naval assets. This is all in preparation for their second embarkation later in the year, when the Squadron will join the carrier and her task group for a large multinational training exercise with U.S., European and NATO partners. The ship will then set sail again next year for her maiden Global Carrier Strike Group 21 deployment. We're proud to provide this unrivaled fifth generation aircraft to help support our U.K. partner in the security of their nation. Moving to RMS, our radar surveillance systems team achieved two notable milestones this quarter. In April, they successfully completed the Sentinel A4 Radar Program preliminary design review, following successful system requirement and system functional reviews, which took place earlier this year. So just four months after the initial contract award, the Sentinel team has already achieved several key milestones as it progresses the critical design review phase later this year, and then in a fabrication, demonstration and test. The Sentinel A4 Radar replaces the current A3 variant and will provide improved Air and Missile Defense against low flying unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles, drones and other threats. For the program of record of approximately 200 systems plus international partnerships the Sentinel Program alone has a total potential contract value of over $3 billion. RMS also delivered to the U.S. Army, the first AN/TPQ-53 radar system, which is equipped with Gallium Nitride to provide additional power and enhanced counter fire target acquisition capabilities. The TPQ-53 radar locates and tracks enemy indirect fire, neither a 360 degree or a 90 degree mode and it was first deployed in 2010 to Iraq and Afghanistan, where it delivered outstanding performance and reliability to defend our troops. We are currently in [4A] production to provide approximately 190 units with a contract value at $1.6 billion. The both the Sentinel A4 and the TPQ-53 are part of Lockheed Martin's open scalable radar architecture, the cornerstone of each of these systems design, which allows for upgrades that will not only extend the lives of the radars but evolve their capabilities over the next 40 or so years. In Missiles and Fire Control, our Air and Missile Defense line of business mark the delivery of the 500 FAD interceptor to the U.S. Army. The FADprogram is a key part of the U.S. Missile Defense System has been selected by multiple international partners to support their national security. MFC continues to expand our production facilities to accommodate that demand. This quarter our space business area, as part of the Blue Origin National Team in this really is exciting and was down selected for the next phase of the human landing system for NASA's Artemis program. The Artemis program is the country's ambitious endeavor to land humans on the moon in 2024 and return them safely to Earth. Leveraging designs and technologies used on our Orion program, Lockheed Martin will produce the crew ascent element, the vehicle which will transport astronauts from the lunar surface to begin their journey back to earth. We look forward to supporting this remarkable mission and continue long running out of legacy of supporting NASA mission. Before I turn over the call to Ken, I'd like to take a moment to thank Marillyn Hewson for her years of leadership and express how honored I am to have the opportunity to lead Lockheed Martin, a company that I consider a national asset. My experiences as an Air Force pilot, flying Lockheed Martin Aircraft and Operation Desert Shield helped shape my belief that helping to provide for the defense of our nation and its allies, is one of the most important endeavors that one can undertake. When presented with the opportunity to become President and Chief Executive Officer here, I viewed it not as a job offer but as a call to service. Moreover, Marillyn and her Executive Team has positioned the company for even greater success for the future, and I'm eager to deliver on that prospect. Since becoming CEO about a month ago, I've met Hewson virtually with a significant number of our key government customers to introduce myself, reaffirm our commitment to performance and affordability and get their feedback. I've been pleased with the broad response of confidence and Lockheed Martin is a key partner, but also the candid discussions on the challenges we jointly face in the National Security Space. There's great appreciation for the technologies and solutions we provide. And we have a long heritage of innovation for our customers. I plan to continue this legacy as well as pursue a long-term strategy to deliver enhanced capabilities to support what I call the 21st century war-fighter concept. That concept endeavors to bring relevant lessons in the latest technologies from the broader tech sector to the defense industrial base. I believe Lockheed Martin is uniquely positioned to address this and other evolving security needs of our nation and its allies. And I'm excited to have this opportunity. I've also had the chance to meet with many of you in our Investor Community in recent weeks that engage in conversations and I look to continuing that dialogue. As you can tell, I'm quite convinced that we can further leverage our key platform positions and broad portfolio to drive a long-term value to our shareholders while furthering both National Defense and Scientific Discovery. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.
Kenneth Possenriede: Well, thank you, Jim, and welcome aboard, and good morning to everyone. As Jim noted, I also hope that each of you are doing well and staying safe. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results and year-over-year growth in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter. We delivered $16.2 billion in sales, $1.8 billion in segment operating profit and $5.79 in earnings per share, which included a non-cash charge related to an international joint venture that we are now exiting. We generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations and we continue to execute our balance cash deployment plan for 2020 returning almost $1 billion to our shareholders. We achieved a new record backlog of greater than $150 billion exceeding our all time high for the corporation for the eighth consecutive quarter. We have updated our full year guidance increasing our estimates for sales, earnings and operating cash flow as COVID-19 mitigation plans and our outstanding performance and minimize our year-to-date impacts. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the business in challenging times. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 12% to $16.2 billion led by volume in Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control, while segment operating profit increased 15% led by earnings growth and Aero and RMS. The resulting segment operating margin was a strong 11% for the second quarter. These results include the impacts caused by COVID-19 and reflect the proactive efforts of Lockheed Martin in our customers to mitigate these disruptions, particularly as they apply to our supply chain. And as we have closely monitored this evolving situation, it has become apparent that some of the impact we anticipated will be realized in the second half of 2020 versus being contained primarily in 2Q. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for 2Q, 2020. Our EPS of $5.79 was up $0.79 over results of last year, driven by our sales volume increase favorable performance and additional FAS/CAS income and excluding the $0.34 for the impairment of the international joint venture we are exiting, the second quarter earnings per share would have been $6.13. On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash returned to our shareholders this quarter. We also had a strong quarter of cash flow generating $2.2 billion in cash from operations. We continue to invest in capital projects to support long-term growth, which resulted in over $1.8 billion of free cash flow. We paid out dividends of $2.40 per share and repurchased $259 million worth of shares. And year-to-date, we have now repurchased over $1 billion in shares fulfilling our 2020 outlook. Our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow allows us to continue with our long standing balanced cash deployment strategy. Let's move on to Chart 7, strong operational performance in all business areas have allowed us to increase our outlook for all financial metrics, as we continue to implement mitigation actions to combat the coronavirus. We are now projecting full year sales growth of 7% over 2019 with consistent segment profit margins, and we've increased our cash flow by $400 million to greater than or equal to $8 billion. On Chart 8, we will break out the increased sales guidance by business area. We have adjusted our estimates for Aeronautics, Space and RMS, increasing the midpoint of our sales range by $1.125 billion. And based on our current assessment of the full year, while COVID-19 has caused disruption in our supply chain and as some of our key locations, we have had non-COVID performance that has offset the impacts and gives us confidence to increase our 2020 outlook. On Chart 9, we show the corresponding increases to segment operating profit by business area, again led by Aeronautics, Space and RMS. And in total, we have raised the midpoint of our segment operating profit guidance by $100 million. And to conclude, on Chart 10, we have our summary. We had a strong quarter, both operationally and financially and we have increased our full year outlook for all metrics. We had another quarter of backlog growth, our eighth in a row, a reflection of the strength provided by our broad portfolio. We continue to closely monitor the environment and evolving conditions in our business related to COVID-19. And we remain committed to providing long-term value to our customers and our shareholders. And with that, John, we are ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We ask you, please limit yourself to one question, if you have any follow-up questions, you can place yourself back into the queue. And first, with the line of David Strauss with Barclays Bank. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
David Strauss: Hey, Jim, to follow up on some of your comments, I wanted to ask you how do you see Lockheed portfolio positioned to perform relative to peers, if you look out at potentially a tougher budget environment over the near term, and how you're thinking about sustaining the Company's peer leading growth into the longer term, if you could take this both from an R&D perspective as well as how you will evaluate investment decisions from a return perspective? Thanks.
James Taiclet: Sure, David, good morning. This company to me is incredibly well positioned for any reasonable range of outcomes in defense spending in the economy over the next few years as well as -- as breadth of product and service that is really essential to the National Defense strategy. So when you put the two things together, I think the company, vis-à-vis peers is incredibly well positioned relative to others. The backlog of $150 billion is equipment and services that the customer needs, they've already signed up and budgeted for. And again, there are ways to solve both opportunity sets. One is if there's a rising defense budget or stable one, we can continue to deliver on that backlog just as it’s contracted, but if it changes, those requirements are still going to need to be met. And because of our platform position, David, we can extend and broaden the capabilities of existing platforms, make sure that their life can be extended while at the same time of being upgraded to whatever standard is required at that point in time. So, I think the breadth of the Company's portfolio of products, services, and domains that we operate in is going to position us well even at a downturn, frankly. Secondly, on long-term growth, that's -- the threats aren't going away. Defense is going to have to be supported, I think in any reasonable person's view going forward, especially if those people are in positions of responsibility no matter what party they may come from. So I view that defense has got to be an important priority for the country. Going forward, there may be a mix change, if you will, but it's still going to be an important priority. Again, the benefit of coming in the door here is the existing portfolio position of the company across the services, domains, international space, et cetera. That broad platform is a risk mitigator in my opinion, to a downturn and say the defense spending trajectory. So on the upside, the innovation gene at this company is fantastic. So when you can apply that innovation genetic framework to the broad portfolio that we have and I hope bring in some tech industry practices and maybe some new partnerships and technologies to augment that I think the upside for long-term growth is really tremendous. And on the R&D front, if we can get our customers convinced that certain types of independent research and development needs to be compensated for perhaps new ways by the government, so the companies like ours and others can take risks, so we can bring in partners that are willing to take risk, at least knowing they may have a path to compensation at the end of the day, and then we're going to be able to accelerate our growth. So we're in a great position to try to work in any environment I think, whether it's defense spending, technology deployment, I've got an idea called 5G.mil that we're going to try to figure out how to create and really bring that technology as just one example, entire [ph]space and drive performance at this company as a result of that.
David Strauss: And Jim, just quick follow up there. How do you -- based on your time at American Tower, how do you measure success from a financial perspective? I think there you really emphasized free cash flow and free cash flow per share and return on invested capital, are you going to apply the same kind of framework at Lockheed?
James Taiclet: Yes, I'm pleased to say that Ken's already applying it as we speak and before I got here, so I was really glad to see that that's a capital allocation decisions have historically been made here. I think that my experience at American Tower, we used a wide variety of vehicles to deploy capital, get others to do it on our behalf and in partnership with us. And maybe we can add some of those elements here, and some might be pre-existing relationships in the tech sector and telecom to join us in some of this investment profile. But, I do think that that we can continue to drive cash flow per share growth here and ROIC stability or expansion at the same time we did at American Tower over a 20-year period. And I think we can do it here too.
Operator: Our next question from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Well, good morning.
James Taiclet: Hi.
Robert Spingarn: Welcome, Jim. Very nice first quarter out of the gate. I have a couple of quick things for Ken on the guide. So Ken, MFC was the one segment where you didn't change the guidance, you had this good bookings quarter, and I guess growth declines a little bit in the second half. Is this a result of COVID? Is it just where the business is? When would -- might it re-accelerate to double-digits? And then just separately, I wanted to ask you what you've got embedded in the guide for F-35 production sustainment and development?
James Taiclet: You bet.
Kenneth Possenriede: Good morning, Rob. So yes, Missiles and Fire Control is the one that we did not adjust guidance. So, you're exactly right. Just to remind everybody, it is still our fastest growing business area, still most profitable business area. But going around the horn, and it's a little bit of what I talked about in the first quarter, our biggest concern from a COVID impact standpoint was clearly at Aeronautics and clearly the main driver -- main concern at Aeronautics is F-35, and we've done a good job of anticipating that in the quarter and hence the results you saw in the quarter. We had really strong results at Missiles and Fire Control in the second quarter frankly and in the first half. You're right, if you look at where we're going, we’re holding guidance. We do see COVID impacts. This is a very high-volume business, so we are starting to see some pressure on Hellfire deliveries and ATACM deliveries regarding -- and mainly driven by COVID. But, we're going to be up year-over-year mid-single digit from a growth standpoint in the second half, so still pleased with the trajectory of where the business is going. Let's see your second question on guidance for F-35. Yes, second quarter, we saw strong growth across F-35. Follow on modernization we’ve received some awards in the quarter that resulted in strong sales growth year-over-year. In fact, we'll see that into the second half of the year. Production, if you recall, we had a little bit of a slow start in the first quarter and that was basically timing of supplier payments to us that picked up in the second quarter, but really strong production growth in the second quarter and sustainment is up as well. And so for the year, we're looking at double-digit growth for F-35. Overall, we're seeing development up really strong, sustainment really strong and production mid single-digits, which is higher than what we thought.
Operator: Our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
George Shapiro: Ken, I wanted to pursue a little bit more Aeronautics, F-35 you had an incremental margin of like 18.5% in the quarter. So obviously, it must have raised the margin if you can share how much the margin went up. And then my second question, if you look at your implied guidance at the high end, the second half of the year has only 3% growth in aero, way down from 15.5% in the first half. And the margin is implied at about 10.6%. So is that just being conservative or are we starting to really see some slow down there? Thanks.
Kenneth Possenriede: Thank you, George. So yes, in the quarter, F-35 was up very, very strong on the top line growth, there production was up strong sustainment of strong as I mentioned on the previous question. If you look at margins, from a production standpoint, they were strong double-digit. We had some risk retirements on a few of our production lots. So it wasn't just [blocked by] but it was a few of our previous lots that actually are still open. So we had some retirements, their development so FCD, the FCD has wound down. That was a low margin business for us. And now, we're embarking on follow on modernization with our customer. And we're seeing strong -- though its cost plus we are seeing stronger margins that we did on FCD think of those as high single-digit margins. And then on sustainment, we had a variety of risk retirement, not one single sustainment program that I could spike out, but there's a variety of sustainment programs that had some risk retirements in the quarter so, so you're right on that a strong quarter from a margin standpoint. Second half, we're not anticipating the risk retirements that we had in the -- in this quarter George and your other question was looking at the high end of the guidance. So though we think we have done a very good job with our customer mitigating a lot of the risks due to COVID in the second quarter, where we are starting to see risks specifically in Texas and specifically in our supply chain due to COVID. And we do anticipate seeing a couple of hundred million dollar impacts specifically on F-35 production, top line due to COVID risks. And so to your question is that being conservative, it's only conservative if COVID does not happen, but if it happens, we feel comfortable with our midpoint of guidance and our high end of guidance.
Operator: And next we go to the line of Jonathan Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Raviv: Thank you and welcome Jim looking forward to working with you hope everyone as well.
James Taiclet: Thank you.
Jonathan Raviv: Just thinking about cap allocation, I know you guys have reiterated your balanced capital strategy. When I think back to the last time this industry faced the potential political change, high deficits, potential budget pressure, the capital allocation strategy looked to get a little bit imbalanced. So just any more further perspective on how capital allocation strategy can shift and flex, if the reality on the ground changed and what might be different today versus let's say 10 years ago, 10 years ago, you're having to repo pretty big dividend on a relative basis, CapEx fell a lot, whereas now CapEx is still at a pretty high level. So because we've been your -- very unlevered balance sheet as well, and to think about how capital allocation plays a role in a pressured budget environment? Thank you.
Kenneth Possenriede: Thanks, Jon. Hi, good morning. It's Ken, I hope you're well as well. So I'll take that, Jon, we're committed to providing still significant portion of our cash flow to our shareholders that's regardless of, what happens, what this downturn looks like. But, I'll – I will start with cash. And we just took our cash up to the greater than or equal to $8 billion this year. We have some tailwinds. And frankly, this year we have some headwinds and with that balance in what we see, with our working capital improvements, we were comfortable doing that. One thing I'll say going out to the future, and it's based on our strong backlog and it’s what I'll call our culture of cash. I've mentioned in the past that we're comfortable right now even with the headwinds that we see out in 2021 of $7.7 billion based on what we see right now, we're comfortable taking that up $100 million to $7.8 billion. And then out to 2022 we talked about the pre-tax change for the amortization of R&D that we saw a path to roughly $7.8 billion in 2022. We're comfortable today taking that up another $100 million. So think of just cash that could be used for internal investments and for cash deployment up $400 million this year up $100 million next year, and up $100 in 2022. We've talked about capital this year and next year are probably the highest capital spends we're going to have think rough numbers, about [$1.07] billion this year, though, there is an appetite to spend more at the business areas, but right now, we're forecasting [$1.07] billion and probably [$1.07] billion next year, which gives us still very strong, free cash flow going forward. We're committed to the dividend, there's absolutely no question. That is our priority. And we don't see that changing in the future. Jim and I will go to the Board to recommend a change to our dividend rate in the September timeframe for the next four quarters. Based on what we see today, it's -- for planning purposes, we should assume high single-digit increases. I think for planning purposes. That's what we'll plan going out into the futures. I still think repos, repos has a place for us. We've talked about the $1 billion this year, we've done about [$1.01ish] billion through July, we're now going to pause at least in the near-term, it makes sense for us to do that based on this COVID environment. And just from a planning standpoint, we should assume $1 billion in 2021 and 2022. And think of that is to prevent dilution in our share count. And as you mentioned, and Jim has talked about this other investments we need to make. We have the balance sheet to do that we have the cash flow to do that. And you saw in the second quarter, we did flow of [$1.150] billion a debt. We did that opportunistically got a great yield on that money. And we're -- we'll continue looking at whether it makes sense for us to go into the debt market, whether it's for organic or inorganic investments.
James Taiclet: So Jon, this is Jim. Ken just gave you a great landscape picture of the whole the scenery here, and I can go ahead and pick up on one thing he did say about maybe something you were looking for in your question, too, is, what would we do different potentially in a downturn on capital allocation, and just to recap the dividends there it's going to be a growing dividend in our view at least Ken and mine and the Board I expect would agree with us. But in a downturn in my historical, recent experience, and my philosophy here is that may be also presenting an opportunity for us if there is a downturn, we're going to look at the silver linings that may be there. And whether it's M&A and other investments. So if you add together the scale of Lockheed Martin in the cash flow that comes from that, they can just define the backlog on top of it the extends out into time and the balance sheet strength that we have, there could be opportunities for us to act in a time period where asset prices are depressed for things that we may want to bring into the company or JV with or whatever. And so that's just another way to picture it, is it the strength and the breadth and the foundation this company allow -- could allow us as it did in my prior experience to get assets we really wanted. That might be even more available at attractive prices, which then drive the nice ROI that you want the cash flow growth to come with it?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And then next we’ll go with the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Thanks. Jim, Ken, Greg, good morning. How are you?
James Taiclet: Good, Rich. Good morning.
Richard Safran: So if you mentioned this in your opening remarks, I apologize. I missed it. Hopefully we have a fiscal ‘21 budget in place by starting the fiscal year. But, what I wanted to focus on was -- and what I wanted to ask you was about the global settlement you've talked about, and I'm sure you're aware that there's also been chatter about additional stimulus funding. So what I was looking for, is if there's any risk to your cash flows, and sales guide if there actually isn't a global settlement endorsed and or stimulus funding, I'm just curious about what assumptions are embedded in the new guide and what you're expecting from the settlement?
James Taiclet: Yes, good morning, Rich, I'll take that. So you're right. We have provided [OSD] the Department of Defense [indiscernible] based on what we see as impacts to Lockheed Martin and its supply chain that go out to September. We just had a few internal conversations and we're starting to have conversations with the customer probably make sense since that is already stale, this is a fluid situation probably makes sense for us to update that rough order of magnitude and it may make sense for it to -- for us to extend it beyond September. We'll go through that with them. Regarding what, what we're assuming from a sales and margin standpoint, what we're generally seeing Rich, is these impacts are out farther than we thought the three months ago, and probably more in the ‘21 time period. And maybe a little bit in the fourth quarter of this time period. So if there is not a deal, the grand deal, I think, the next course of action would be for us to go work individually with our respective customers to negotiate on a case-by-case basis, what the impacts are to us. And what are not, the issue is going to be, the available funding for that. If there's not funding, these are all allowable costs. And, then the question becomes -- we put that into our forward pricing rates, and there might be some modest impacts to a couple of our programs but that would be probably more at the profit level, not at the top line. And right now we don't see that playing out as advertised. So it's fluid and we're working through this with our customers.
Kenneth Possenriede: Seems like the summary is that the 2020 guidance is not greatly affected in either direction, whether the stimulus goes through or not.
Operator: Our next question from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much. Jim you come from a tech background. You talked about, seeing opportunity to adopt some practices from commercial technology at Lockheed Martin, potential for partnerships A program you mentioned 5G.mil, could you expand a little bit in terms of how would you bring commercial technology into the company, and what would you expect to gain from it?
James Taiclet: Sure, Cai. There's a number of approaches to this. Again, in my previous experience, we were embarking on this for commercial 5G applications, which is Internet-of-Things at scale including autonomous land and air vehicles. So that's happening in the tech sector now. So there's a 5G standards of that there's computing, which is storage and processing of data that's moving to the edge of the network and intermediate places from data centers to the edge. And there's the autonomous vehicle infrastructure and devices, we call them edge devices over in the tech side, that are being built, you think of them as the driverless car, et cetera, et cetera. So all of those elements are being processed a page, it's going to take time, by the way to do any of this in the commercial space. And those practices can be brought over, I think, to the defense industrial base. But only quickly if our customer comes along with us and changes some of the procurement practices, how we can get paid for things, there's a licensing regime that you may be aware of in the telecom space, particularly that enables global standards to be built. And then each participant or competitor designed to that global standard. That's how you can get 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G done in a space of 20 years when it takes that long to get one defense program done. So those are the kind of practices I think we can migrate over with some of those partners that are working on these things on the commercial side. Now, again, this is a long cycle initiative. Is it is on the commercial industry to it's going to require cooperation with our customer, and they're authorizing us to try some of these things. Because no one's going to take any risk on the defense industrial base by implementing these technologies in a different way. If they're not sure they're going to get paid for it. So we've got a lot to do. But frankly, it -- in American Tower we endeavor to change the industry to go from where transmission sites for telecom networks were non-performing cost centers inside the telephone companies and we converted them through commercial practices and basically, sale leaseback type of approach. We turn those assets into performing assets for commercial companies like ours that were able to create value for shareholders over a long arc of time. So this can be done. But it's going to take time, it's going to require just like it required American Tower, the cooperation of our customers, who were then the telephone companies to work with us and engage in this. And the only reason they did was because they could deploy their networks faster, get capital from us to do it and also to have a lower total cost of ownership for the site over time. And when you multiply that by, we have 180,000 sites back in my prior company, we basically help change the industry, not just us, but around the world. That's the kind of aspiration we have here at Lockheed Martin, and we are in a position to do it, and I would argue a way better position than we ever were back in the in the tower and digital infrastructure industry 15, 20 years ago. So that's the aspiration, Cai how to do it we know, we've got a great example on commercial telephony and technology and how they collaborate through standards bodies and other mechanisms in JVs and alliances to get this done. And so those are the kinds of practices we can bring over. It's not easy. It's not going to happen in a hurry. But the benefit again, Lockheed Martin has is the backlog is so strong on what I call the product centric way of doing defense industrial based business, that we've got time. And we can perform as we try to also move the industry towards a network centric way of doing business.
Operator: Our next question is from Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
Seth Seifman: Ken, I wanted to just follow up quick, maybe on Rich's question about a settlement and the industry has been fairly vocal about this being important. You guys have mentioned that there's not very much impact one way or the other on the guidance for 2020. So should we think about it, then as you know, if it is important, and it's not important for 2022, so we think about it as being something that's important for 2021. And maybe if you could explain to us a little bit about the mechanics of, then there is a settlement sort of what happens is that, is that cash that the company has been missing out on this year, that will come at some point, perhaps next year, how should we think about the mechanics of how that all runs through the P&L?
Kenneth Possenriede: Yes so, whether it hits this year, next year or all years Seth it is important, it's important to the industry. And it's not just Lockheed Martin it would be across our entire supply base. As I mentioned this is fluid, it's got a lot of moving parts. It probably just for our financials, it will -- it modestly in the second half of the year, but then probably hit more and ripple through the supply chain in the first half of 2021 is our best assessment. Mechanically, the way this could work if it was a big settlement, we still have to go through the details, but I'm guessing that the expectation would be so pick the F-35 a brand settlement, I think the expectation internally just from a program performance standpoint and at the customer level, they would want those costs and those budgets if you will to flow into those respective programs. I'm going to speculate that there probably would be some kind of clip level, from a dollar threshold standpoint that we would utilize with the customer set of what gets flow to the program. So there probably is a point where it's going to be a diminishing return and cost more to implement that across programs and not. Assuming if there's not a grant deal I think what you would see is each program would deal with a case-by-case and then mechanically, that's how that would happen. And it would be a sales impact, a cash impact and an EBIT impact across each respective programs. But, what you're talking about ballpark -- whatever our number is, it's -- we're a $65 billion, round up to $65 billion company. It's not going to be that material to our bottom line specifically if it's over a multitude of years. So we'll see, we'll see where this goes. I think this has got to take some time to play out still.
Operator: Next we'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everybody.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: So you feel that a number of questions here on what your business could look like for your capital deployment could look like in the hypothetical that the defense budget declines. And so I wanted to ask you the question, do you think the defense budget will decline? And we all obviously can -- and have a view on that based on the inputs that are visible to us, but I'm assuming you all have more insight into the geopolitical landscape and then maybe what both sides of the [IO] are thinking right now and in the committee's, but also in the potential presidential platform. So maybe beyond just the standard, world a dangerous place so. What is your view on whether or not defense spending goes down and if it were to actually grow? What specifically could make that happen from here?
James Taiclet: Noah, it's Jim. I tried to not speculate on the behavior of people that are going to make independent decisions that we can't predict. So we're just getting the company ready for either scenario frankly, if it's stable, slightly rising or moderately rising defense budget, we know how to handle that. But if it's a declining defense budget, we're planning for that too. So we can't predict one way or the other that the behavior of human beings, whether it's six months from now, or whenever they're going to make these kinds of decisions, but what we can do is prepare for both scenarios. And that's exactly what we're doing. All of our BAs are looking at all their programs and saying if and they're planning this under Ken's guidance, if there's a downturn in defense defending, which I've asked every BA to look at and get back into the integrated plan, if in that scenario, it's a red team kind of an exercise, what would we do? It's a contingency plan that says, okay, we would offer with -- to our customers to say, look if your budget is x minus y. This is what we think you should do with our products and programs for extending lives and other things like that. And with the backlog we have in the orders in track and the production lines that are going into supply chains that operate is going to be two to three years before those defense budget cuts actually flow into the defense industrial base production line. So we've got time to work with a customer to make sure that that they can have their contingency plan and we're behind and we're working with them 100%.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Great, thanks. Good morning.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
Myles Walton: Jim, I'm curious. If you look at from an operating segment level, where do you think your leadership might have the most impact from what you're bringing to the table, which are your technology partnerships, lessons learned that vertical integration from an M&A perspective? And how would that manifest would it be, faster growth, better margins, maybe just, where you think you could have the bigger impact, maybe one level down at the organization?
James Taiclet: So by operating segment, each of those businesses with the corporate support they've had, they're great at what they do, I'm probably not going to make a better missile design than people in MFC can make so, what I think my benefit or add value added might be as cross cutting those BAs in a way that hadn't been done before here or anywhere else. And then linking them with a customer to do what the customer is literally asking us for, which is how do we connect equipment, systems, communication networks, across what they call domains. So how can I have satellite, get a signal from an F-35, then goes back to a ground based Missile Defense System to hit incoming threat to, up one of our installations? That's what they really want. Not any single one of our business areas or any other companies, frankly, I think could give them that, that solution. So we're working with, our recently hired CTO who was previously running DARPA to look horizontally across what are the missions that the DoD and our allies need to do? And what BAs and what BAs do we have the assets, resources and time technical capabilities to provide them that horizontal solution. So our typical backlog, we're providing what I call vertical solutions, we're providing products, platform, services, generally to one service, the F-35 and exception of course, but to one service, maybe just the one country, but we're going to need to link across services better we're going to need to link across our allies better. And we're -- and that's what this network solution is really about in my mind. So that's what I think Myles we can bring our tech world partners and, and U.S. and other allied countries, companies into this to make us better horizontally. I'm not sure they can even make us all that better, vertically, all that often, but horizontally, I think we can. And that's where you bring in the AI the 5G, the distributed computing, things like that. Some of our vertical technologies like hypersonic, we're going to do just fine in that, now we may buy individual M&A opportunities or targets to be able to fill ourselves in or do more mission system work in a technology like that, but I think it's more horizontal than vertical Myles to be answered quickly.
Operator: Our next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning Jim. Ken, can I ask you a question on just the order environment? You had a really strong quarter. I think Jim mentioned $22 billion in orders of 1.4 book-to-bill, but maybe you could just highlight some of the international pursuits that are still in front of you. And if you are seeing any kind of delays or chatter because of COVID-19, and maybe just how that -- will you expect to still come in this year in 2020? Thanks.
Kenneth Possenriede: Thanks. Good morning, Peter. Thanks for the question. Yes, we still see some great opportunities out there specifically, internationally. We're not seeing that much slipped to the right, I'd say the only thing we may be seeing to the right, are the requests for proposal, solicitations we are moving to the right but they are holding firm to the end dates. But to answer your question specifically, a couple of things that we have out there that are quite large or we have a indefinite quantity and definite delivery F-16 order coming. The [indiscernible] key customer is Taiwan, and another country customer that should get announced sometime in this quarter. Think of that as an additional 90 aircraft for F-16 which we're quite pleased with. There is a C-130. Indonesia order that we're also anticipating happens later this year. There is some follow on work for the recently announced India Navy's MH-60R program that we got earlier, those are the main -- mainly the large ones we also have an [indiscernible], Japan order that we're anticipating later this year. And then of course there's a variety of F-35 production orders that we plan to book later this year that rough numbers 40% of those quantities will be of international nature. Going into next year, we see -- we also continue to see some strong demand for specifically F-16, our Integrated Air and Missile Defense. In parallel with our customer, we're pursuing a CH-53K order in Germany and in Israel that should get -- we'll shape that this year and hopefully get that award in a competition sometime next year. So there are a lot of international opportunities out there and really not seeing a lot of slowdown in -- from an order book standpoint.
James Taiclet: John, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Great. And that will be from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much, and good morning.
James Taiclet: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: [indiscernible] I think is the way you guys describe it. I think just like to follow up on what Noah was asking about, not asking you to necessarily speculate on where the U.S. Defense budget could go to. But maybe to follow up on your introductory comments about the challenges in National Security, are these challenges around resources or is it around your folding the capabilities the U.S. will need to address national security threats going forward? And also could you elaborate a little bit more on that. Thank you.
James Taiclet: I would characterize the challenges or the pursuits that China and Russia are taking to regain status as peer competitors, the United States in this field. And when you get into the depths of what's going on, it's concerning from someone who's been in this space, my whole career off and on. So that's the real challenges, we've got a country that in the form of China, which is getting very aggressive in their actions, their attitudes and their aspirations and they're investing in capabilities. Some of them are symmetric, and some of them are asymmetric to find our vulnerable spots in our traditional way of running our defense operations and trying to get ahead of us in those especially vulnerable spots. So there's got to be a lot of investment and a lot of technology investment to firm up those vulnerable places in our defense posture. And that's what I would characterize as the big challenge. And Russia on the strategic side, whether it's hypersonic missiles or other fairly strategic threat type elements is back in the game and investing too. So they may not be the great land army, they were in the 1980s and threatening Europe in that way. But they've gone to a technological threat posture, which allows them to do it from a greater distance. And we'll look with a much smaller military organization, if you will.
Greg Gardner: And gentlemen, just past the hour, so I think I will turn it back over to Jim now for some final thoughts.
James Taiclet: Sure, as I conclude the call today. I do want to thank the employees of Lockheed Martin for their contributions and dedication during this time of global pandemic. They performed with excellent supporting our customers and their important missions. And I'm extremely proud of them and to be part of Lockheed Martin team now with 110,000 plus other teammates.

Marillyn Hewson: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope this call finds you and your family safe and healthy as we collectively work to address the many issues brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. Our nation and the global community have seen the dramatic effects of the COVID-19 crisis. We are all saddened by the rise in illness and the tragic loss of life that has resulted from it, and our Lockheed Martin family has not been spared from this pandemic. The world continues to battle this disease, with experts predicting improvements will be seen in the coming weeks and months. And while this is certainly encouraging, we must remain vigilant to ensure progress is achieved. The corporation is taking necessary steps to help combat this virus and keep our employees safe while assuring our customers can achieve their important readiness and mission requirements. We are beginning to experience some issues in each of our business areas related to the coronavirus, primarily in access to some locations and delays of supplier deliveries, which have caused us to adjust our full year sales outlook, and we will discuss that later in the call. Our teams are successfully addressing many of the risks that have arisen due to the COVID-19 impacts. Our manufacturing facilities are open, and our workforce is engaged. The situation will evolve, and we will continue to monitor our business environment for areas of concern. The corporation remains committed to delivering the products and services needed for our customers and to maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for our employees. In recognition of this unprecedented situation, the U.S. government has taken several actions that continue to reinforce the importance of our nation's defense industry. The Department of Homeland Security deems the defense industrial base to be part of the nation's essential critical infrastructure. And the Department of Defense has issued guidance that confirms the expectation that companies providing products and services in support of national security continue to maintain staffing and work schedules to perform their crucial functions. The DoD also published a deviation on progress payments memo, issuing a blanket increase to progress payment rates for both large and small businesses. Stable and reliable cash inflows provide needed visibility for all businesses and will be especially important to many small and medium-sized suppliers. These actions underscore the country's commitment to our industry and importantly, to our supply chain, which provides tremendous innovation and strength to our national security products. The international community is also deeply affected by this crisis. And our company is committed to perform with excellence for our global customers and to support the health and well-being of our employees around the world. The corporation is taking steps to aid our employees, teammates and others. And in a few moments, I will discuss some of the actions we have taken to help provide support to those affected by this crisis. I will touch briefly now on the Department of Defense budgets and the recent presidential budget submission. This quarter, the President submitted the fiscal year 2021 budget recommendation to Congress, consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 enacted values, with the total national defense request equaling approximately $741 billion. Notably, the DoD reiterated their commitment to the national defense strategy and their submission, with the space domain, air and missile defense and hypersonic programs, key pillars in their strategy and our portfolio, all receiving increases from the previous submissions. Congress will continue to process with the authorization and appropriations phases. Our programs remain well supported, and our portfolio is broad and expanding. We look forward to the finalization of the process and supporting our warfighters' needs. Ken will review our first quarter financials and updated full year outlook in more detail in a few minutes. I would like to begin by noting that the disruptions introduced by this virus have caused us to reduce our 2020 sales expectation as production and supply chain activities have recently slowed in our Aeronautics business area. The changes in our outlook represent impacts we anticipate being recognized over the remainder of the year. We are not projecting any changes due to our expected full year operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations outlooks that we set forth in January. Our results this quarter were very strong. Sales in the quarter exceeded last year's first quarter by more than 9%, led by our Aeronautics team as the Aeronautics business area grew 14% from the first quarter of 2019. Our segment profit came in just above the first quarter 2019 amount as risk retirements in all business areas allowed us to exceed our expectations in this quarter. And we had a strong quarter of cash generation, bringing in over $2.3 billion of cash from operations as we look to achieve our full year target of greater than or equal to $7.6 billion. Moving to orders and backlog. We received more than $15 billion in orders this quarter, maintaining our backlog at approximately $144 billion, our all-time high. RMS garnered the largest set of awards, with the total exceeding $7 billion, led by our Sikorsky organization, which booked over $4 billion of orders, including over $2 billion for a performance-based logistics contract for the U.S. Navy to provide sustainment services on our MH-60 SEAHAWK platform; and award of $500 million for the second low-rate initial production, or LRIP, contract for 12 combat rescue helicopters; and $470 million awards -- award for LRIP 2 of the presidential helicopter contract, adding 6 aircraft to the program and bringing the total order to 12 rotary aircraft out of a total program of record of 23 aircraft. Aeronautics also had a strong quarter, with aggregate F-35 orders approaching $900 million. Other awards, including a new classified order, brought the Aeronautics business area total to $3.6 billion for the quarter. Missiles and Fire Control received a pair of sizable awards this quarter, led by precision fires, which booked a $1.1 billion order to supply guided multiple launch rocket systems to the U.S. Army and international customers. MFC also received an order for over $900 million to provide FAD interceptors and equipment to the U.S. Army and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And our Space business area received a fleet ballistic missile order of $600 million for continued Trident II production. Our performance to date and resilient portfolio have positioned us to achieve strong results so far this year. The effects of the COVID-19 outbreak are being felt by our teams, but we remain committed to delivering the vital solutions that our customers require. This pandemic has caused dramatic impacts to our employees and their families, our customers, our supply chain and the communities in which we work and live. Our corporation is committed to use our know-how, resources, leadership to assist during this global crisis. Lockheed Martin is implementing multiple actions to help support affected groups, including accelerating payments of over $150 million to our small and medium-sized supply chain partners, and we have already flowed the first $50 million of an additional $450 million in accelerated payments to our global supply base as a result of the actions taken by the Department of Defense in changing the progress payment policy that I mentioned a moment ago. We have also donated $10 million to nonprofit organizations involved in COVID-19-related relief and assistance with emphasis on veterans and military families. And we have activated a $6.5 million employee disaster relief fund to assist Lockheed Martin employees and retirees impacted by COVID-19. In addition to supporting our global customers through our ongoing contract activity performance, we recognize that providing jobs during this period of economic downturn is also critically important. We are committed to continued hiring during this crisis and have added close to 1,000 new employees over the past few weeks, in addition to advertising for 5,000 open positions. The journey to full recovery will be one which we will all share together. Lockheed Martin is committed to performing with excellence for our stakeholders as we navigate through this crisis in the weeks and months ahead. Moving on, I would like to highlight several significant events that occurred across the corporation during the past quarter, beginning with Aeronautics. We were excited by 2 significant milestones for the F-35 that show the program's continued maturation and ongoing demand. In February, the F-35 team celebrated surpassing 250,000 flight hours for the program, including developmental test jets, training and operational U.S. and international aircraft. The program has now trained more than 1,000 pilots and in excess of 9,000 maintainers as this unrivaled stealth fighter progresses towards full-rate production. In March, the F-35 team delivered the 500th production joint strike fighter aircraft, a conventional takeoff and landing variant for the Air National Guard. Production continues to ramp as we progress towards the joint government and industry plan of record for delivery of more than 3,300 aircraft. Moving to RMS. This quarter, our Sikorsky line of business was down-selected in 2 key rotary wing competitions for the Future Vertical Lift program. The Sikorsky-Boeing team was awarded 1 of 2 future long-range assault aircraft contracts to continue design and risk reduction efforts on the next-generation medium-lift helicopter for U.S. forces. Our SB>1 DEFIANT offering uses our Collier award-winning X2 Technology providing enhanced maneuverability and speed. We look forward to working with our Army customer as we collectively define the next-generation assault aircraft for our warfighter. We were also excited to be down-selected in the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Phase II competition. The Sikorsky RAIDER X rotorcraft uses the same unique technology as the SB DEFIANT -- SB>1 DEFIANT and provides the same speed and maneuverability advantages. Each of these competitions represent long-term growth opportunities, and our Sikorsky organization has been investing for years in pursuit of innovative technologies and designs to fulfill the warfighters objectives. Our Space business area celebrated a pair of milestones this quarter as well as the first 2 GPS-III spacecraft were each separately accepted into operations by the U.S. Air Force Space Command as healthy and active, officially joining the current GPS constellation of 31 satellites. These are the first 2 of 10 modernized GPS-III space vehicles that will be deployed to enhance navigation and positioning capabilities for millions of users. The next-generation GPS-III program will deliver signals 3x more accurate than the current satellites with improved availability, reliability and anti-jamming capabilities for our military users. And we are proud to continue this legacy of innovation for our warfighters. In Missiles and Fire Control, you may recall last quarter, we commented that Missiles and Fire Control have passed an important milestone on the U.S. Army's Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, competition. This quarter, our tactical missiles organization performed its second consecutive successful flight test of this next-generation, long-range precision missile. Our team demonstrated the missile's flight trajectory, range in accuracy and overall missile performance from launch to the conclusion of the mission. We look forward to building on our long-running army tactical missile system legacy in preparation for our third PrSM flight test in the coming weeks as we continue to pursue this potential franchise opportunity. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.
Kenneth Possenriede: Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter. We generated $2.3 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our balanced cash deployment actions, returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders. Our backlog closed just above $144 billion, exceeding our all-time high for the corporation. And we have updated our outlook to include impacts from COVID-19, which we will discuss in greater detail in a moment. Overall, it was still a strong quarter for the business during uncertain and unique times. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% compared with last year to $15.7 billion, continuing the consistent growth of the business, while segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. The resulting segment operating margin was a strong 11% ahead of our expectations. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the first quarter of 2020. Our EPS of $6.08 was up $0.09 over our results last year driven by FAS/CAS income and favorable operational performance. On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash return to our shareholders this quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $2.3 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was greater than $2 billion. We maintained our dividend to $2.40 per share, and we repurchased $756 million worth of shares. This brought our total cash return to shareholders to $1.4 billion for the quarter or 72% of free cash flow. And we see no change to the $1 billion share repurchase outlook for 2020 that we first communicated during our call last October. Chart 7 shows our backlog balance through first quarter of 2020. While delivering our highest first quarter sales ever, we increased our backlog balance for the seventh consecutive quarter driven by bookings at Sikorsky and missile programs at Missiles and Fire Control. Moving on to Chart 8. Based on our view of COVID-19-related potential impacts, as Marillyn noted, we are lowering the midpoint of our guidance range on sales by $375 million while holding our guidance for segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And as we disclosed in the earnings release, our joint venture, AMMROC, in the UAE lost a key contract award after the end of the quarter, and we are still working the assessment of a potential noncash impairment that could be recorded as early as the second quarter once our review is finalized. On Chart 9, we have shown the adjustments to our sales guidance range. Likely COVID-19 impacts on our supply chain and related potential delivery delays have caused us to reduce our full year outlook for Aeronautics. Our expectations for 2020 sales in all other business areas remain consistent with what we discussed in January. On Chart 10, we show our outlook for segment operating profit by business area. While the guidance for profit has been lowered for aeronautics following sales, we have raised our guidance range from Missiles and Fire Control and Space, holding our total segment operating profit consistent -- constant from January's outlook. On Chart 11, we outlined some specific assumptions we are using in our 2020 guidance related to the current impacts of COVID-19. We continue to monitor the situation daily as it remains a dynamic environment. And as Marillyn highlighted, we are proactively taking steps to help support our suppliers and teammates during this difficult time. Our current expectation is that the next few months will be the peak of disruption as the country and the rest of the world looks to successfully flatten the curve move forward. The Department of Defense and the United States government have also taken action to support our industry through policy changes and the CARES Act, and our outlook has taken into consideration these benefits. Together, these actions have allowed us to update the outlook we provided in January with minimal impacts. And to conclude, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe that the first quarter of 2020 has laid the foundation for a strong year. We have a robust backlog to sustain our growth. Our sales outlook is growing year-over-year and represents an approximately 6% increase from 2019. Along with consistent profit and positive cash flow, this allows us to project strong results for 2020 for shareholders as we continue to support our employees, customers and supply chain during these difficult times. So before we move to Q&A, I would like to take a moment to congratulate Marillyn on her upcoming transition and thank her for the outstanding leadership she has provided Lockheed Martin over the last 7.5 years. As Chairman, President and CEO, the corporation has reached new heights and delivered remarkable results from our customers and shareholders. Marillyn, during your 37 years with the company, we have all employees, customers, teammates and shareholders benefited from your dedication, inspiration and vision. You and I have worked together for 20 years, and on a personal note, I would like to add that I will also miss your friendship and partnership. Although your presence will certainly be missed on a day-to-day basis, we look forward to continuing to work with you as Executive Chairman of the Board. And I'd also like to welcome Jim Taiclet as our incoming President and CEO, who begins on June 15. I have worked with Jim as a Board member for more than a year while I've been in my current role, and I believe he will be an outstanding leader for our company. And with that, I'd like to wish Marillyn the best of luck, and I look forward to welcoming Jim in June. John, we are ready to begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And first, with the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi: Okay. Ken, there's language in the release and you kind of alluded to in your prepared remarks regarding the guidance and kind of reflects your current view on COVID-19. Can you talk about how sensitive the guidance is to duration? Maybe help us a little bit more with kind of what you're assuming for what a return to normalcy looks like. Do you see the effects of this in terms of fixed price contract costs increasing your ability to recover that? Just trying to understand your perspective on how this impacts kind of earnings power and cash flow power longer term.
Kenneth Possenriede: You bet. Thanks, Joe. So it's probably helpful we start with, once this started, what our processes were. Think of this as our battle rhythm. So once this began, we started a weekly COVID-19 impact tracking process. We put together a template, and this was generally across the board, included all the business areas. We had data that we collected that supported various internal and external reporting. In fact, we're now in a rhythm where Marillyn is now sending a memo to the SAEs, think of those as the service acquisition executives. And this is done on a weekly basis. That basically lays out all the impacts that we see, all the actions that we're taking to minimize those impacts. And think of these inputs as at the contract program level, so across the corporation. It's about 600 line items, and it's tracking real and potential Lockheed Martin supplier- and government-driven impacts. The COVID impacts that we're seeing are reflected within this weekly template. And unfortunately, they're predominantly risk-related. Think of them as travel restrictions and site access that are most likely the common cited driver of impact. We're seeing increases in supplier shortages. And in our sites, we're seeing some absenteeism impacts. There are some opportunities that we do see that exist, Joe. From a cash flow standpoint, the customer altered the progress payment rate from 80% to 90%. And also a small nuance but important, they changed some conditions regarding progress payment rates, which will be advantageous to us. And we are now flowing this -- as Marillyn mentioned, we are flowing this all down to our supply base. Starting with our small suppliers and our vulnerable suppliers, we have a process where we work with supply chain. They tell us who those suppliers are. We work with Treasury to determine on a weekly basis the cash flow that we have that we're flowing that down. Contract actions that we're working with our customer, it's accelerated timing of the pending awards, undefinitized contract actions, or UCAs, funding, et cetera. What we're also seeing internally is there -- we're capturing cost avoidance. So think of lack of travel, lack of business trips that we're making, lack of sponsorships, lack of air shows that we're going to. And we're capturing that and collecting that, probably not to take to the bottom line but to help with impact disruptions to our business. You talked about the recovery of costs with the CARES Act. One of the conditions in there is we will work with the PCO and demonstrate to them a request for equitable adjustment that those costs -- those idle costs should be deemed allowable, and we'll work through that. In fact, we have a path forward on the F-35 program to do just that. So we think we're in a good position. The plan is, at least the way we see it, is we're hoping that the curve starts flattening in the second quarter, end of second quarter, and we can get to some kind of semblance of business as usual, whatever that is, starting in the third quarter. You asked about cash, Joe, we feel really good about our cash, and I'll let somebody else -- I'll give some more color on cash for somebody else to ask the question, but we feel really good about our cash flow this year. We started the year strong, ended the first quarter strong, and we see, going forward, strong. So thanks, Joe. Stay safe.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay: I guess I'm tempted to ask that cash question, but I'll let somebody else do it. I'll ask what I was going to ask you before. Can you talk about the F-16? I'd like to talk about how that move to Greenville is going for one and how you think about the F-35 in the context of the F-16 sort of a growth versus replacement-type situation, both near and medium and long term.
Kenneth Possenriede: Hunter, we'll give Marillyn a break since it's her last earnings call. So I'll take that. So it's going well. So as everybody is aware, I believe, we moved the F-16 program out of Fort Worth a couple of years ago. Frankly, no home because we didn't have any orders of record and Bahrain was our first customer. We moved the line to Greenville, going very well. Right now, we have Bahrain. You saw we just announced Bulgaria. We have Slovakia. We're in the throes of working with the United States government and Taiwan for them to buy 66 aircraft. There is an African country that is interested in F-16. So we're hopeful that will happen. South American country, and then there are some Southeast Asian countries that are interested in F-16 as well. So we think the program is doing very well. The MOD programs are doing very well. Just in the spirit of COVID, we're not seeing many impacts at all on the F-16 program. So I think this is a good fourth-generation aircraft for those customers that can't afford the F-35 or, frankly, can't at this time buy the F-35. And it might be a good intermediary step for customers to go from the F-16 to F-35. So we see it frankly as complementary and not competing against themselves.
Operator: The next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: First, Marillyn, it's been great working with you over the years. So just wanted to wish you all the best in the transition. I wanted to ask about international sales. And particularly, when you look at the Middle East, I thought it was encouraging that you got this award from Saudi Arabia. But when you look at oil prices where they are today, in the past, we have seen budgets contract when oil prices come down. How are you thinking about the Middle East right now given the oil price environment? And even expand that to say with coronavirus issues in other markets and budgets that may be under pressure, what are you seeing internationally in your export sales?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, first of all, Doug, thank you for the question. And I would say at the outset that regardless of what's happening with oil prices and other things, the threats continue to accelerate around the world. So we still have that challenge anywhere in the world. I mean it's the first order of any country that they have to protect their citizens. So a lot of the systems we sell into the Middle East are clearly defensive systems. And more than ever, that's more complex, volatile and unpredictable than it's ever been before. So that's a necessary condition that they have that national security, and I expect that will continue. We will continue on our side to drive affordability across all of our product lines to make sure that what we do offer is the best value to those countries and -- but we aren't seeing a pullback from the needs that they have today in the Middle East.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Marillyn, you've had an amazing career, and it's apparent in Lockheed success in both the top line and operations. I guess as you exit on top, how do you think about the challenges for Jim in areas you would have liked to spend more time with on Lockheed and position better for the next 5 years? How does Lockheed continue to grow over the next decade?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, thank you, Sheila, for your kind comments. I would first start by saying that I think this is the right time for a transition in our company because our company is very strong and stable. We've got solid performance. We've got a very strong robust growth strategy, even again this year continuing to grow. We finished out last year with a record year, and we've had a series of a very strong record for the past few years. And we're set up well with a $144 billion backlog, which I think outlines -- that's the booked work that we have and a strong financial position. I think as Jim steps into the role -- he's been on our Board for over 2 years, as Ken said, and he has a military background. He's worked in the industry, in Pratt & Whitney and Honeywell. He's got a lot of strong experience around our industry, our markets, our business. And so he brings that, plus the insights he's gained on our Board for the last couple of years in our strategy, our long-range plan. So I think you will see that he will continue to drive the success that we've had over the last few years. He fits very well into our culture, and we're really looking forward to -- he brings a strong acumen -- business acumen because, of course, he's himself been a CEO for the past 17 years. In terms of priorities, we will continue to strengthen our focus on our customer. That has what's driven the success of this business is aligning with their priorities and listening to them and understanding what they need and then driving sustained profitable growth around that and delivering them the performance that they expect because they do depend on us. As we said earlier, we're an essential industry sector, and that is clearly because of the national security products and capabilities we produce. And so we know that performance and innovation for our customers has got to be continued. And then lastly, I would just say, keeping a focus on the people in this company. We have a strong culture of -- an innovative culture of people that make the difference. And I know that as Jim comes in with his style of a value-based leader as he is and a collaborative leader that he will continue that forward. So I think you could -- that you can just look at us as being very well positioned for the future as we -- as I turn over the reins to Jim in mid-June.
Operator: And our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors.
Peter Skibitski: Congratulations, Marillyn, on a great career. On the COVID-related sales reduction in Aerospace, I just want to make sure I understand. Was the guidance lowered there due to the international F-35 sites, Italy and Japan sites? And why were the other segments not impacted?
Kenneth Possenriede: Sure. Pete, it's Ken. I'll take that. So let's talk Aeronautics, and then I'll go around the other business areas. So Aeronautics, we looked at -- we started seeing that it is likely there is going to be -- and I'd say it's probable that there's going to be some supply chain disruption. What we're seeing is there's local distancing requirements that are being more stringently applied across the globe. There's workforce disruption. There are likely impacts that are happening throughout their supply tier hierarchy. There are shipping constraints. We've actually had some issues with shipping constraints. We're also finding there's likely going to be some production impacts at our site. And based on that, the analysis to date had given us concern. So we reduced our guidance at Aeronautics. And specifically, it's F-35 production. There's more analysis that we're going to do over the next couple of weeks working with our supply chain and our Fort Worth production line and our customers to set -- to determine, if any, impact, to what extent it will be on the program, including deliveries. In fact, last night, I got some feedback from the supply chain team, and this is specific to F-35 and specific to production. We're seeing some pressure regarding supplier performance-based payment invoices. So this is -- these are invoices that they could deliver to us after they completed a milestone. There are a couple of suppliers that are going to be delinquent in April. Some of them are for administrative reasons. We'll work through that. So that's just timing. But some of them -- and some are domestic, U.S.-based, and some of them are international, that it is due to them not achieving their milestones. Some of it is going to be COVID-related, probably most of it is COVID-related. We're looking at that. So we then did an analysis, a bunch of sensitivity analysis with the Aeronautics team. And if you look at F-35, we're seeing little to no impact to development. We're able to continue to work on follow-on modernization. That is what typically is happening on the development program. Sustainment, generally speaking, the team does not see any impact. And if they do see impact, back to Joe's question about the recoverability of the costs, we feel comfortable due to the CARES Act. If we have somebody who can't get on base to do, say, a repair, if you will, or to stand up a base and they're sent home and they're not able to do productive work at home, we are believing those costs are recoverable. And so it's all down to production. We have seen in the past some impacts at the Japanese FACO, they're up and running now; and at the Italian FACO, but on the whole, they're up and running as well. So it was our determination based on what we're seeing that it was prudent for us to take our production sales down. Hopefully, this is a conservative number, but based on what we're seeing, we think this is a good number. You asked about the other business areas and why we're not seeing impacts there right now. So I'll start with Space. So think of their production cycle, it's a long production cycle. And generally speaking, what -- any issues that they would see in the supply chain or at our facilities, they feel they could contain. So it's low volume, certainly, relative to F-35 production line. They have an engineering workforce. They were one of the first ones to be -- they were the first ones, frankly, in our company to be impacted by this. They're now staggering their shifts. They're staggering the days that people come into the office. It is impacting some of their classified programs, but we seem to be doing a nice job working around that. So we feel good with their guidance right now. RMS, they don't have the volume. So talk -- the manufacturing floor, they don't have the volume of Fort Worth. Think of their volume more like Marietta. And I did -- I was remiss not to talk about Marietta. So there are some suppliers where we are impacted that we are doing workarounds and we do think we have a containment plan. So we do see some modest impact at Marietta, but it's not material. So I would state that RMS is more like Marietta. So there are some issues there, but they're not material in nature. Their engineering team, so the folks that are doing engineering work at RMS, are still productive. There are some base and range closures that are impacting RMS, but we seem to have workarounds and so we don't see any impact there. The next concern we would have is at Missiles and Fire Control. And it's just based on the -- it's a high-volume business. They have done a nice job of looking through their supply chain. They have made contact with 100% of their suppliers. And before -- last week, I would have told you, 6% are forecasting impacts. In Maryland staff meeting, we found out yesterday, it's up to 10%. So they actually have a very robust process of talking through their supply base. They had 2 suppliers that had closed operations. One of them we're still working through and working through second sources and also containment plans for them. And another one had an operation in Mexico. We worked through that and got that one open. So we feel good right now where Missiles and Fire Control as well -- where they are as well from a guidance standpoint. But that would be our next worry bead would be Missiles and Fire Control. So net-net, we're good with guidance at the other 3. We think we've thought through the Aeronautics one -- Aeronautics issues, and we feel good about that. And just -- we've looked across the portfolio, and not just COVID-related risk, but we've looked at, call it, business as usual opportunity and risk, and we think we've box-balanced everything, and we feel good about our guidance as it stands today.
Operator: Next, we'll go to David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: Congrats and well done, Marillyn. I'll take the bait, Ken, on cash. I think you were talking about a little bit more than a $700 million working capital headwind or increase this year. How are you thinking about that now on the back of COVID-19? And maybe comment on Q1, you saw a big increase in your payables balance.
Kenneth Possenriede: You bet. Thanks, David. So yes, we -- like I said, we feel good about cash flow this year. And I'll say it again. If it wasn't for COVID-19, we were very comfortable with taking our cash from operations up -- our cash from operations number of greater than $7.6 billion. So yes, going into the first quarter, we did increase payables. We did pay down payables in the fourth quarter. Part of the reason why Aeronautics and a couple other business areas did so well was, frankly, we got invoices -- from a timing standpoint, we got invoices in -- late in the quarter that ended up being payables, so we had abnormally high payables that also then flowed into inventory or into contract assets, which we do think is an opportunity going forward for us. So even with the COVID impacts, we do see, over time, working capital increases, specifically in contract assets, most of them in F-35, and we're working with the F-35. We think there's an opportunity there for us to reduce our contract assets. The other thing I would state is -- why we had the high payables in the first quarter is these COVID actions that Marillyn described of us flowing money down to the supply chain really didn't start happening for the most part until we got into the second quarter. So we'll continue to flow down that committed $450 million that we got certainly through the second quarter, but David, it's likely we're going to flow that down in the third and fourth quarter as well, and we will probably take our -- what I'll call our normal payables number down in the fourth quarter and accelerate payments to the small business base and our vulnerable suppliers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Marillyn, all the best for the future, but I have a final question for you. And it's a little bit tricky. I was wondering what's your gauge of the political environment at the moment, whether it's, what you might say, politically acceptable for the companies to be buying back stock given the crisis the country is going through.
Marillyn Hewson: Well, thank you for your comments, Rob, and thanks for the question. The political environment today, I know, is very difficult, particularly for companies that basically have no demand. And when everything shut down -- and I'm very pleased to be part of the conversation on the President's task force and on some other task forces our company is so that we can work with governors and the President on looking at how best to get the economy back to work in a very safe and effective way. As you know, as we've talked about, we've been running all through this time. And so we're in a position where it's a matter of sharing how we're keeping our people safe, how we're keeping our operations running, we're dealing with supply chain, a lot of the things that Ken spoke of here. In terms of the political environment, where there are -- I think what you're referencing is where companies are going to get some kind of support from the CARES Act and other ways to help their business, and then as a result of that, would it be appropriate for them to destock buybacks. And I think you've heard all of them, at least all that I've heard, go publicly say, no, that's not their intention. They really need that funding today in order to address their business need, to address their cash needs, to address getting their folks back to work because, basically, their demand went to 0. I think it's very different than a normal company like -- that sets out the year with a plan on cash deployment, which would be through dividends, through stock buybacks, through capital investment, through the range of things that we all do with cash, and we -- in our case, we haven't changed our process at all. I mean we made a commitment in October that we were going to do about $1 billion in stock repurchases, and that's -- that we still are holding to that for this year. And so we're very different, I think, than those who have experienced a very significant impact to their demand. Ken, I don't know if you want to add anything on that front relative to our situation on...
Kenneth Possenriede: You bet. Yes. So Rob, I'll give you just a little color of what we've done actually. So late last year, we entered into a 10b5-1, and think of that as an enhanced open market repurchase program. So we essentially went to the banks late last year and said, we want to buy $500 million to $600 million of stock back starting in January through July. So we're in this 10b5-1 through July. And in the first quarter, of that, we bought $256 million back of the $756 million that you heard me state we bought back in the first quarter. Early in the year, we thought it would be advantageous just to go on autopilot, if you will, and we signed up. This would be our second one, we did one in the fourth quarter of last year, an accelerated share repurchase program. And as you know, when you commit to that, you put the money upfront, gives the bank then the discretion to buy it back when they want to buy it back. So we fronted that money, if you will, in the first quarter. And that plan goes through the end of April. So think of that in 9 days, that program is over. So that's why you saw the amount we bought back was earmarked $756 million of repos in the quarter. As I stated, we reaffirmed -- and Marillyn just foot stomped that, we reaffirmed our $1 billion commitment, which basically will be on autopilot that will go through July. So think of us buying back another $244 million over the next couple -- next 2 months to get us to the $1 billion. And what we have done in the past, just frankly over the last couple of years, we've done this just to prevent dilution of our share count, and that's what we're committed on now. If we get out of this COVID situation, we may look at this again and readdress it and see if it makes sense to opportunistically buy our stock back if we think that makes sense. But in the meantime, while COVID is going on, our commitment is we're going to maximize our balance sheet to generate cash flow, and we're going to send as much down as we can -- and as much as we can down to our distressed vulnerable supply base and our small supply base. While we're on capital deployment, I'll talk about dividends. It is from a planning standpoint. Our plan, subject to the Board's approval, for us still to declare and pay dividends. So that's in our modeling for the rest of the year. And I'll just remind you, we're still spending, investing in our business roughly $1.3 billion in IRAD for this year. And as I stated earlier, we're still on a path from a CapEx standpoint to spend roughly $1.7 billion on CapEx. So we're not skirting our responsibilities to our supply chain nor to the investments we believe we need to make for us to be a vibrant business going forward.
Operator: Next question is from Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter Arment: Marillyn, congratulations on all your success. Ken, maybe just a backlog question. You have stable backlog, and I think the expectation was for 2020, you'd see growth of $3 billion to $4 billion, whether that -- is that still intact? And is there any kind of international awards that are key that we should be looking at that will impact that?
Kenneth Possenriede: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Yes, the plan is we still think we're going to grow our backlog. I mentioned earlier for one of the questions, we're working with the -- I'll talk United States first, the United States customer. We're working with them where it makes sense for us to accelerate orders to get that into our backlog, to get that behind us. You already saw F-35 Lot 14 was in the second quarter. We got that order behind us. And that does actually have some international customers. Think of 35%, 40% of those airplanes will be going to international customers. But there are a bunch of international orders, and I'll go through them, that we generally feel pretty good about. So Bulgaria is behind us for F-16. We got those 8 aircraft behind us. We're working with Indonesia on some C-130 aircraft. We feel good about that. Working with India, you probably saw the announcement that the money is flowing from India to the United States. So we'll now work with the appropriate government agencies to get that under contract. That's for the MH-60R multi-role helicopter program. We have a Spain F-110 frigate program we feel good about. F-16, Taiwan, I mentioned, that's a third quarter order. We still feel good about that. We also have a couple of orders for F-16 that we're working to try to shape. There's a Norway contract out in the fourth quarter. So I'd say on the whole, we're feeling good about our order book. And in fact, because of some accelerations, we actually think we'll overachieve our orders planned this year by over $3 billion. And that's mainly driven by PAC-3, that's FY '21, where I think we're in a good spot with the customer to accelerate those orders.
Operator: Next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.
Carter Copeland: Again, congratulations on all the accomplishments and the retirement. It's been quite impressive. So just want to kind of follow up a little bit on the award environment. And I think a little bit longer term, you hinted at it, Marillyn, on the plus ups and areas of emphasis and things that are in the NDS. And I just wondered if you might give us some color on how you see that influencing the opportunity pipeline that you've been talking about over the last several quarters, not just in hypersonics but also at MDA. And just anywhere you think that, that's unfolding in a way that's different as a result of the budget request.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question. Thanks for the comment, too, Carter. I appreciate it. Well, as I talked in my opening remarks about the FY '21 budget -- President's budget request that came out, and while the top line budget is not growing significantly, there's a little bit -- some slight growth, and so we're looking -- as we look at it. But Congress really is yet to weigh in on what's in that budget for our programs. Right now, they're well supported. But we -- often, Congress looks in and determines whether they want to do some ads and in certain areas as well. So for example, last year, they added 20 planes for the F-35. And we've seen some other areas of support from Congress over the years. So we feel good about what's in the budget request right now. As I mentioned, it does line up with the national defense strategy. And that's exactly the areas that are lined up with our particular portfolio. There's -- the budget submission has over $3 billion in it for hypersonics, which is we've shown that we are a strong leader in that. We continue to see as we look beyond that, there's also some upside for NASA, for Orion and for some of the Mars missions. I think there's over $3 billion that was put in increase for that. And then we continue to look at not only continued growth through the U.S. budget side but also on the international side. Now these would be FMS sales, but F-35, as you know, Poland has committed to 32 aircraft. We see opportunities with Finland, with Switzerland, with Spain potentially and other countries, we think, that are starting to show interest -- continued interest in the F-35 as a potential to meet their fighter replacement needs. And then on the missile defense arena, THAAD, PAC-3, Aegis, all continue to be growth opportunities for us. If you look on around to the Sikorsky side of the business, I mentioned the Future Vertical Lift. That's a big upside for us as potential as we see opportunities for growth there. CH-53K that we do for the Marine Corps with a 200-aircraft program of record. There's also strong interest in Germany and in Israel. And then in our Space business, we continue to see upside there in a lot of the space protection and a lot of the mission areas there for the national security space opportunities for growth. So I feel really good about our growth opportunities as we look out even beyond this year and into the future. Space side, the next-gen OPIR and GPS are other contract opportunities that we continue to see growth. So as Ken said, we expect our backlog to grow. We expect to continue to win at a good rate on these opportunities because we have a strong portfolio. We've been investing for many years in things like hypersonics and other areas of our business that set us up well for robust growth.
Kenneth Possenriede: John, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And that will be from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Securities.
Ronald Epstein: Marillyn, if you could speak to when you think about the impact that COVID's having on some of your international customers, meaning you've got F-35s potentially going different places in the world. And how do we think about the impact that, that could have on those deliveries of aircraft?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, on the international front, I think Ken talked a little bit about the fact that we have a couple of final assembly and checkout facilities on the international scene, so in Italy and in Japan. And early on, they did have some impact where they shut down for a few days or for a week, but they're back running again. We have suppliers around the world that support our F-35 program and other programs. So we watch how those suppliers are working in their various countries with whatever constraints they might have or safety protocols that are put in place. And so that's -- as Ken said, we do a very deep dive on our supply base on a weekly basis to make sure we're monitoring that, and we're addressing that. So that could potentially have some disruption for us. Similarly, we -- transportation is an area that we've been watching to make sure that we've got good transformation of the parts and components coming in. But I think in terms of countries, it goes back to my earlier comment. Countries are still -- need to address their national security needs. So I'm not looking at it so much from an impact on what they will buy because they are staying on their procurement plans, and despite the fact that things like COVID-19 will have some impact on their economic situation just as it has in the U.S. I think it's more really around the international supply chain that we're going to keep a bead on that to make sure that those suppliers around the world continue to operate. We -- as we talk about cash deployment to our suppliers, we are getting to those international suppliers as well because they're part of our supply chain. And so to the extent that we have an opportunity to flow through and accelerate payments, we accelerate them to them as well as to our domestic suppliers in the U.S. That will continue to be the area for us. We -- they may face challenges of productivity or absenteeism and/or other constraints, and so we'll continue to watch that closely. And frankly, that's the area that we watch the most closely and why we've been so focused on it every week. Okay. So I guess that's our last question. So let me just conclude the call today. And before I do, I know several of you, starting with Ken, know that this is my last call as President and CEO. And I appreciate your kind remarks, and I appreciate, Ken, what you said as my colleague and friend for so many years, and I appreciate your comments. But I really wanted to take this time at the end of the call just to thank the entire Lockheed Martin family for the support and dedication that they've given as the company has grown and flourished over my now 7.5 years as CEO and, moreover, over 37 years with this company. We are a very strong corporation, and we've got a legacy of innovation and performance and a future of promise and growth. And when I think back 37 years ago when I first started as an industrial engineer supporting the production line in Marietta, Georgia, I'm reminded of a lot of hardworking and dedicated people that I worked with over my career, including the people that I work with today, the current employees that are making a difference every day in the work that we do because we do some of the most important work in the world. So it's been an honor for me to be a part of this team and this company. I've often said, I consider Lockheed Martin a national asset because we perform an important mission and support of our nation's defense and its citizens and also our allies around the world. I also want to thank you, our investment community and our shareholders, for your participation in these calls and also for your thoughtful engagement that you've provided with our management team over the years. It's helped us as we understand what's important to you and how you look at our business and the questions that you ask. And I said earlier, I know that you will welcome Jim Taiclet to our team. I'm certain that he's going to lead the company to continued success. He has a tremendous track record of achievement that's outstanding, and he's -- as I said earlier, he joins a company with a culture of performing with excellence for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. So I assure you that Lockheed Martin will be in very good hands with Jim at the helm. So thank you again for joining us on the call today. Our team looks forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. John, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

Marillyn Hewson: Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone. I hope you had a good start to the New Year. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call as we review our results, strategic new business activities, key accomplishments, and our outlook for 2020.I will begin by expressing my gratitude to our entire Lockheed Martin team for a remarkable 2019. Over the course of the year, the corporation achieved extraordinary sales growth, earnings performance, strong cash generation, and record backlog and it was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to deliver these results. Ken will discuss our financials in more detail and provide our outlook for 2020, but I'd like to begin by discussing a few of the highlights from 2019 that drove our strong performance.Notably, for the second year in a row, all four of our business areas grew sales, earnings, and backlog with each contributing to our record cash from operations. Sales in the fourth quarter exceeded last year's fourth quarter by 10% and pushed 2019 growth to 11% over our 2018 results.Missiles and Fire Control had the highest overall growth in 2019, exceeding the prior year by 20%. Deliveries of tactical and strike weapons, development work on new hypersonic and classified programs, and PAC-3 missile production were the strongest contributors to the increase.Aeronautics also saw strong sales growth in the quarter and year with 2019 annual sales finishing 12% above 2018, led by our F-35 program which grew 14% in 2019. In space, the next-generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or next-gen OPIR contract, the GPS III satellite production program, and recent hypersonic wins continue to provide increased sales volume as the business area exceeded their 2018 topline by 11%.And Rotary and Mission Systems finished the year 6% over 2018, driven by increases in shipbuilding, radar and logistics programs.Our segment profit grew nearly $700 million year-over-year, resulting in a segment profit margin of 11% and earnings per share of $21.95, which was another high watermark for the corporation.This quarter, our backlog increased $6.6 billion and is now approximately $144 billion, reaching a record level for the fifth consecutive year. And we had a strong quarter of cash flows allowing us to use $1 billion to prefund our required 2020 pension contribution and a portion of our 2021 payment and still generate over $7.3 billion of cash from operations for the entire year.Had we not made this discretionary payment to our pension trust, we would have delivered over $8.3 billion in operating cash, well in excess of our greater than $7.6 billion objective.2019 was an extraordinary year across the corporation with our team achieving record results in sales, earnings, EPS, cash from operations and backlog. The strength of our portfolio has us well-positioned to continue delivering mission success for our customers and outstanding value to our stockholders.Before reviewing significant accomplishments from each business area, I will start with an update on the F-35 program, which had an especially successful quarter and year. During the fourth quarter, our F-35 team delivered 51 fighter jets, bringing the total deliveries in 2019 to 134 aircraft, exceeding our joint government and industry target of 131 aircraft, a nearly 50% improvement from last year and a 200% increase from 2016.Since the program's inception, we have delivered 491 production aircraft with 347 jets being provided to U.S. forces and the balance of 144 planes being delivered to our partner nations and international foreign military sales customers.Keeping with the F-35, we are pleased that we finalized our agreement for last 12 and 13 this quarter, recognizing orders of approximately $5 billion and adding 112 aircraft to our backlog, bringing our backlog to 374 planes. We anticipate finalizing lot 14 in early 2020.Our joint industry and government team has established a long-standing objective of offering the F-35A model at a flyaway cost of $80 million in lot 14. And we were able to improve on that target one year ahead of schedule. The lot 14 unit price is now below $78 million, which allows us to offer this remarkable fifth-generation fighter at a price equal to or lower than legacy fourth generation aircraft.Internationally we were very excited to see Norway declared initial operational capability with its fleet of F-35 conventional takeoff and landing aircraft. Since the first F-35 model arrived at Ørland Main Air Station in 2017, the Norwegian Air Force has conducted a rigorous operational testing program in unique winter and northern environmental conditions and has deemed it ready for combat. Norway is the third European country and the fifth international customer to declare. [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the inconvenience. We will be restarting the call in just a moment.
Greg Gardner: Thanks, John.
Operator: And you're reconnected please continue.
Greg Gardner: Hi, this is Greg Gardner, apologies for the technical difficulties. Thank you for your patience. We're going to commence again with the call pick it up with Marillyn talking about the F-35. Thank you. Marillyn?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Greg. So I'll just pick up again some of this. I'll just repeat it's very short but I just want to cover all of the F-35 update before I move into the other operational highlights. So I'll start with an update on the F-35, which had an especially successful quarter and year.During the fourth quarter our F-35 team delivered 51 fighter jets bringing the total deliveries in 2019 to 134 aircraft, exceeding our joint government and industry target of 131 aircraft. A nearly 50% improvement from last year and a 200% increase from 2016. Since the program's inception, we have delivered 491 production aircraft with 347 jets being provided to U.S. forces and the balance of 144 planes being delivered to our partner nations and international foreign military sales customers.Keeping with the F-35, we were pleased that we finalized our agreement for lots 12 and 13 this quarter, recognizing orders of approximately $5 billion and adding 112 aircraft to our backlog, bringing our backlog to 374 planes. We anticipate finalizing Lot 14 in early 2020.Our joint industry and government team have established a long-standing objective of offering the F-35A model at a flyaway cost of $80 million in Lot 14. And we were able to improve on that target one year ahead of schedule. The Lot 14 unit price is now below $78 million which allows us to offer this remarkable fifth-generation fighter at a price equal to or lower than legacy fourth-generation aircraft.Internationally, we were very excited to see Norway declare initial operational capability with its fleet of F-35 conventional takeoff and landing aircraft. Since the first F-35A model arrived at Ørland Main Air station in 2017, the Norwegian Air Force has conducted a rigorous operational testing program in unique water and northern environmental conditions and has deemed it ready for combat. Norway is the third European country and the fifth international customer to declare IOC a critical milestone for Norway and the entire F-35 team.Also this quarter, the Dutch Arm Forces welcomed the arrival of their first F-35 to sovereign soil in a celebration attended by more than 4,000 people at Leeuwarden -- I'm sorry Air Base -- Leeuwarden Air Base.The Netherlands has been a key partner in the F-35 program and including the 8 aircraft still stationed in the U.S. for training and testing purposes has now taken delivery of 9 CTOL jets in total.The Netherlands program of record is currently to procure 37 F-35 with the opportunity for an increased order as last October the Dutch government announced plans to purchase 9 additional jets bringing the total to potentially 46 aircraft.Turning back to our business areas, I'd like to highlight a few of the notable new business wins and follow-on awards that have helped position us for long-term growth.Rotary Admission Systems received an award of nearly $2 billion for the detailed design and construction of 4 multi-mission surface combatant ships for Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This ship is a version of the Freedom variant which were a combat ship, we have been delivering to the U.S. Navy and will provide the Kingdom with the capabilities needed for both shallow water and open ocean naval operations. We are honored to support the Kingdom in their Saudi Vision 2030 objectives.In Missiles and Fire Control the U.S. Air Force announced the finalization of the $1 billion contract for the air launched rapid response weapon effort, we were previously awarded. Our hypersonics portfolio experienced tremendous growth during 2019 with the total potential value the corporation has received now exceeding $4 billion.Missiles and Fire Control also booked a $770 million order for PAC-3 missiles to provide additional interceptors and ground support equipment to the U.S. Army and the United Arab Emirates continuing the growth in our air and missile defense line of business.Moving on to Aeronautics, our air mobility team was awarded their third multiyear contract for the C-130J transport aircraft approving the delivery of 50 new planes over the next few years.The finalization of this contract added an incremental 35 aircraft and over $2 billion to our backlog in the fourth quarter with the overall value for all 50 planes expected to exceed $3.4 billion.This award comes as the aero team celebrated the delivery of the 2600 C-130 airlifter since the program began over 60 years ago, with over 450 planes being the current J model. We are proud to be able to continue producing this venerable aircraft for our war fighters and those of the 70 nations currently operating it around the world.And in space, we were awarded a $3.3 billion 10-year IDIQ contract for the combined orbital operations, logistics and resiliency, or COOLR program, to provide support services on several military communications satellite constellations, including our advanced extremely high-frequency spacecraft.These satellites provide nuclear-hardened anti-jam global communications to the White House, the State Department and military users, supporting the nation's nuclear command and control system. And we are proud to be able to support the ongoing mission of this critical element of our national security. These announcements reflect the strength of our legacy programs, both domestically and internationally, as well as the impact of our continued investments in forward-looking technologies to drive long-term growth.Turning briefly to budgets. The fiscal year 2020 Department of Defense Appropriations Act was signed into law last month and finalized defense spending for the current fiscal year. Total defense budgets have been proved for approximately $738 billion, consistent with the levels passed earlier in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 and over $20 billion above FY 2019 enacted amounts.Our programs garnered strong support across all business areas, with the legislation including nearly $3.5 billion of increased funding beyond the presidential budget request, including $2 billion for 20 additional F-35 fighter jets for a total of 98 aircraft; over $800 million for nine additional C-130J transport aircraft for a total of 20 planes and increased funding for our long-range hypersonic weapon Orion and OPIR contracts, as well as increases for several rotary aircraft programs and other initiatives across the corporation. We believe our portfolio is well positioned to address important security needs for our nation, with the increasing defense budget and these additional appropriations actions, supporting continued growth opportunities into the future.Moving on, I would like to highlight several key accomplishments from across the corporation, that demonstrate our commitment to developing new technologies, as well as expanding the reach of our heritage solutions. I will start with Missiles and Fire Control, who passed an important milestone on a prospective new business opportunity.Our tactical missiles team successfully tested its next-generation long-range precision missile for the U.S. Army's precision Strike missile or PrSM competition. The Missiles and Fire Control team launched PrSM from the Lockheed Martin High Mobility Artillery Rocket, or HIMARS system, successfully demonstrating accuracy and range of flight, validating HIMARS' interfaces and testing system software performance. We are excited by the prospects of this enhanced surface-to-surface system and look forward to building on our long-running Army Tactical Missile System legacy, as we progress through the upcoming procurement decision.Moving to RMS. Our integrated warfare systems and sensors line of business was selected by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to produce two solid-state radar antenna sets for their Aegis Ashore system.Our SPY-7 radar offers enhanced detection range and sensitivity from previous legacy radar systems and will provide continuous protection of Japan from ballistic missile threats. Our RMS team has continued to invest in new technologies, while leveraging current solutions and this new radar is a direct derivative of our long-range discrimination radar solution, a missile defense agency program of record.Variance of the SPY-7 radar will also be incorporated into other U.S. and international solutions. And to-date this technology has been selected for 24 systems ushering in the next-generation of maritime and ground-based advanced radar technology.Moving to Aero, this past November marked the official start of F-16 production at our Greenville, South Carolina location. Fabrication activity began for components of the center fuselage, one of the first steps in building new F-16 aircraft for the growing demand from new international customers. The first delivery for our Bahraini customer will roll off this line in late 2021 and we look forward to increasing production as new orders are added to the backlog.I will close with our Space business area which delivered the Mars 2020 Rover Aero Shell to Kennedy Space Center in December. The Aero Shell will encapsulate the Mars 2020 Rover during its deep space mission to Mars and protect it from the intense heat as the entry system descends through the Martian atmosphere.This Aero Shell marks the latest heat sheet ever used and will protect the vehicle from temperatures up to 3,800 degrees Farenheit. Lockheed Martin has built every Aero Shell entry system for all of NASA's 40 years of Mars explorations and we are proud to continue this legacy as we work towards a July 2020 launch.Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to reiterate my appreciation to the entire Lockheed Martin team for their contributions to an outstanding year and for helping to build a differentiating portfolio. Ken?
Ken Possenriede: Thank you, Marillyn, and good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.So, let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations, and earnings per share closed ahead of our expectations with record highs. We generated $7.3 billion of cash from operations after a $1 billion discretionary contribution to our pension trust this quarter. And we continued our cash deployment actions returning $3.8 billion of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We again grew our backlog to $144 billion, a new record high watermark. In summary, it was an outstanding year for the business.Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 11% or $6 billion compared with last year to $59.8 billion, continuing the strong performance over the first three quarters, while segment operating profit increased 12% or $700 million over last year to nearly $6.6 billion.On Chart 5, we compare sales by business area with last year's results. And as Marillyn mentioned, all four of our business areas experienced strong sales growth in 2019, led by Missiles and Fire Control of 20%, which was driven by a production volume in tactical and strike missiles and air and missile defense. And for the first time, all four business areas delivered sales above $10 billion.On chart 6 we'll discuss our segment operating profit by business area. Following sales, all four of our business areas also increased profit in 2019 and the corporation ended the year with total segment operating profit 12% above 2018 levels.Chart 7 shows our earnings per share for 2019. Our EPS of $21.95 was up $4.36 or 25% higher than our results last year, driven primarily by operational performance.Moving on to chart 8, and as previously noted by Marillyn, backlog has increased again to a record high for the fifth consecutive year. All four business areas increased backlog in 2019 with the largest increases coming from space, driven by strategic missiles and at Missiles and Fire Control, driven by air and missile defense. We had a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 for the quarter and 1.2 for the year.On chart 9, we will discuss the cash return to our shareholders in 2019. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $7.3 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow is greater than $5.8 billion. We increased our dividend by 9% and exceeded our share repurchase objective by $200 million in the fourth quarter. This brought our total cash return to shareholders to $3.8 billion for the year or 64% of free cash flow, providing strong returns consistent with our historical cash deployment actions.Moving on to chart 10. We provide an update to our 2020 trending data with our revised outlook for the year ahead. Our outlook for sales ranges from $62.75 billion to $64.25 billion, which is an increase from the $62 billion we first indicated last quarter. The midpoint of this range represents a 6% increase over 2019 results. The range of segment operating profit is estimated to be between $6.8 billion and $6.95 billion.Our estimated FAS/CAS pension adjustment is just above $2 billion. Our estimated range for 2020 earnings per share grows to between $23.65 to $23.95 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 7.7% increase over 2019 results. Cash from operations is now projected to meet or exceed $7.6 billion and I'll discuss this in greater detail on the following chart.On chart 11, we will walk through our future cash expectations, folding in the $1 billion discretionary pension payment we made last quarter. Strong operational cash performance and a continued focus on working capital management allowed us to increase our cash outlook for 2020 to greater than or equal to $7.6 billion, a $100 million increase to the combined 2019 and 2020 outlook we provided in October. And we now see approximately $7.7 billion of cash flow from operations in 2021, a $700 million increase bringing our three-year expectation to $800 million greater than our prior assessment.On chart 12, we break down our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area. All four business areas are positioned for continued sales growth in 2020 led by Missiles and Fire Control at 10%. Segment operating profit growth is projected to grow at approximately 5% in the aggregate with our largest growth in aeronautics at 8%.And finally on Chart 13, we have our summary. We believe 2019 was an exceptional year for Lockheed Martin. Our key results exceeded previous highs and have positioned us well for continued growth and value creation in 2020. And as we discussed earlier, our focus on innovation and investment has resulted in strategic new business opportunities and a robust legacy of programs.And with that we're ready for your questions. John?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning, Rob.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning, Rob.
Rob Stallard: Quick question for Marillyn. On the F-35. You mentioned in the release that your guidance had a bit of a caveat regarding Turkey. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the progress in allocating those Turkish delivery slots. And also realigning the supply chain?
Marillyn Hewson: Sure. Thanks for the question, Rob. I would just say, we've been working with the U.S. government for several months on addressing how we're going to manage the eight aircraft that were slotted for Turkey that have been delivered for Turkey as well as looking at alternate suppliers for the Turkey suppliers.And so in terms of the Lot – the upcoming lots, we have a lot of demand for the aircraft as you are well aware and we've had the congressional ads that will offset those needs from Turkish – the Turkish aircraft delivery. So I think we've got it well solutioned. Anything you want to add to that Ken?
Ken Possenriede: Yes. Just – Rob just from the revenue side, Marilyn's got it right. So the United States government for the ones we've delivered in sub to date, which would be the Lot 10 Lot 11 aircraft. There are earmarked for the United States government. In lot 12 through 14, the block buy each of those lots eight aircraft were earmarked for Turkey for a total of 24. The congressional adds for the most part we'll take care of that. So we're in good shape with the block buy.We'll now work Lot 15. We just got the RFP from U.S. government. So I think from a revenue standpoint, we're in great shape. We have other customers that are coming in. Japan as you recall, want to order an additional 105, we have Belgium. We're in a competition for Finland, Switzerland and Canada. We feel good about those, especially as Marillyn mentioned, the $80 million aircraft, we got there a year ahead of time. And you probably saw in the press the polls want to buy 32 aircraft. So I think from a revenue side, it's well in hand.From a supply standpoint, almost all supply out of Poland will – excuse me, out of Turkey will be removed by March of 2020. There'll be a handful of suppliers that we'll continue to work with – through December 20th. And as I mentioned we got the Lot 15 RP, so we'll sort all that out post-2020 as we go on. But I think we're in a much better spot now than we were with the Turkey situation.
Rob Stallard: Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will move to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks and good morning. Can you laid out the 3-year cash outlook the update with the $800 million of incremental. I'm just curious, could you give us the backbone on the net pension recovery in there?And how much change you mentioned contributions came down, but it also looks like your CAS recovery came down. So just trying to piece out of that $800 million, how much is from your operations? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: You bet, Myles. So yes, I think we should start with how we ended the year with cash that got us to making the voluntary pension contribution. So we ended -- you guys recall, we ended the third quarter up in working capital by $1.2 billion.Fourth quarter from third quarter, we actually reduced our working capital by $500 million. So for the year, we were just south of growing our working capital by $700 million.So with that strong cash generation in the fourth quarter, we thought it was prudent to make the pension contribution of $1 billion. And so if you go forward and look at 2020 and beyond Myles, and also recall our Lockheed Martin investment company we -- our returns were superior to what we assumed back in October or frankly what we assumed in the beginning of the year. They ended the year at 20% returns on their assets.So with all that our cash contributions came down in 2020 to just south of $2 billion. We do not -- we're not required to make a pension contribution this year. So going forward our CAS recoveries look like there'll be about $2 billion in 2021.Our pension contribution recall the last time we spoke regarding 2021, we thought our pension contribution would be $2 billion by making the $1 billion pension contribution not only eliminated 2020 pension contribution, it reduced the $2 billion pension contribution by $0.5 billion, but also because of the great returns we made in last year. It looks like our pension contribution now in 2021 as we see it is below $1 billion.And just going out to 2022 and then I'll stop. Looks like our CAS recoveries will be roughly $2.2 billion and that $2 billion pension contribution in 2022 that we discussed in October looks like, it's about $1.7 billion, $1.75 billion.So a lot of it is improvement, volume improvement, margin improvement throughout the business, but some of it also is due to the returns we made on our pension in the past.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Rob Spingarn: Hi good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Rob Spingarn: Marillyn, Ken you both went through a lot of detail on the international successes on aircraft and ship platforms. And Marillyn you sort of previewed the question, I want to ask when you talked about Japanese ages, but I wanted to talk about your recent modernization wins at DoD. They're sizable. You've had things like hypersonics and AM260 at MFC, Central Radar at RMS. And I wanted to see how these might translate to even greater longer-term market share internationally, or are they too strategic to export?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, that's a great question, Rob. I mean, we're always working with the U.S. government. As we look at these systems, we're always looking at what systems could potentially be provided to our allies and to increase their defense capability and capacity.So without hitting each one of these specifically that you outlined, I mean, just -- I think the Aegis Systems is a good example. When you look at some of our increases in things like PAC-3 and FAD and now with the radar capabilities, I mentioned, the opportunities that we have on Long Range Discriminating Radar. It's all in our planning that, when we work with the U.S. government, that we make sure that we have an opportunity to consider not only the needs of the U.S. government, but on many of these systems, what they could provide to the international community.And as you can see, with our very robust backlog, about $144 billion, it gives us an opportunity to not only perform on that work that we have, but to continue to invest in new technologies and new capabilities. And that's what we've been doing for a number of years. We have highlighted areas in the radar arena and hypersonics and directed energy.And a whole range of systems and capabilities that we recognize, we've got to constantly provide our customers with the advantages that they need over our adversaries. And so, we're always looking well ahead of now to invest in it. And we think that, with that, it is with an eye towards being able to support our international customers as well.
Operator: Next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Yes. Good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Ron Epstein: I was wondering if we could just walk through a little bit. When we think about the F-35 program, as we go into 2020 and maybe even beyond, how you think about the mix between OE and sustainment? I mean, there's been a lot of, I guess, press about the sustainment going from something like the total flight hour cost at $35,000 per hour going down to $25,000 per hour. I mean, how does that impact the program? And how should we think about as we model F-35 in the 2020 and beyond, the mix between OE and sustainment?
Ken Possenriede: Sure. Hey, Ron, it's Ken. I'll take that. So, yes, in 2020, if you look just macro at F-35 we see --we actually see pretty strong growth year-over-year. Sales are going to be up about 8%. Think of that as --the lion's share is still production. So, production year-over-year will be about 8%. But we still see development work, even with SDD winding down, with follow-on modernization and other development activities. We'll see development this year grow from 2019 about 10%.From a sustainment standpoint, we're still on these annualized buys and we're still standing up bases. And we've talked about the performance-based logistics proposal, that white paper that we put in, so we'll see high single-digit growth in sustainment. And if we continue on these annualized buys. It will still continue to grow.You'll see sustainment over time become the fastest piece of our --of the F-35 program. It will likely double in size from a sales perspective in the next five years. And potentially throughout the next decade, could double or triple from where it is today. But I think the PBL is an interesting concept and we're starting to have that conversation with the customer. And it basically is to talk about what you just described is to accelerate to get the cost per flight hour of maintaining the aircraft down to what the customer would see as an affordable level, but also the availability of the aircraft to get that up to levels that are more like fourth-generation aircraft and the owners then would be on industry -- the risk would be on industry.We would do the investing for the -- for our customer set we would have the infrastructure in place. And assuming we performed, we would sign up to these service levels, we would expect a return that's more in line with that type of contract.We're hopeful we'll be able to get to the table with the customer in 2020 and shape this thing and hopefully be able to get a deal that's acceptable to both parties. But you're right, in the future, you'll see sustainment grow faster than the rest of F-35, at least in the short-term, it will still be production until we get to capacity which should be peak capacity which should be 2023, 2024.
Marillyn Hewson: But I would add there's continued demand around the world and as we continue to -- we're now at a very affordable unit price on the aircraft. And as long as we can offset the development cost that will come as we continue to upgrade the aircraft and then drive the sustainment costs down, I think we see an outlook of great opportunities for the aircraft around the world.
Ken Possenriede: That's right.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And next will be Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hello everyone.
Marillyn Hewson: Hey.
Ken Possenriede: Hey, how are you doing, Noah?
Noah Poponak: Doing well. How are you Ken?
Ken Possenriede: Okay. Thanks.
Noah Poponak: So, I wanted to stay on the multiyear cash flow discussion. I could sort of see the investor question that was previously does it grow in 2021 because of the contribution step-up moving to 2022 with the contribution step-up now there year-over-year.So, one do you grow cash from ops year-over-year in 2022? And I think you have five-year internal planning. So, maybe you could speak to -- can you grow cash flow every year in the five-year period because that just remains a big investor question?And then having given the pension pieces I wondered if you could also speak to capital because that came in a little light for the year? That'd be very helpful. Thank you.
Ken Possenriede: Thanks Noah. Just a clarifying point from a long-range plan standpoint we do current year plus three years out. But I will give you a little -- I'll try to give you a little color 2023 and beyond, but I don't have an absolute number for you.So, I think you wanted to start with 2022 since I gave you color up to 2021. And that's actually a timely point right now not just because of pension funding, CapEx, but just from a cash-generation dynamics including the pre-funding looking at growth our focus on working capital. It basically would all point to cash from operations out in 2022 frankly being north of our 2021 number. We see a path to greater than and equal to 77.There is one issue that it's worth talking about now and it's the remnant from the Tax Reform Act of 2017. The law has a provision that kicks-in and it kicks-in in 2022 which requires research and development expenses to be capitalized rather than being expensed. Right now though the law is -- it's still a little bit vague what the exact definition of R&D is. And believe it or not I've actually read the legislation myself and I do see some vagueness in there. But in the interest of transparency it's probably good. We talk about that now.So if the IRS made the determination that the law applies to all R&D expenses, it probably would take our cash number down. So this would be things we are expensing now that we would have to amortize over five years. It would take our cash from ops in 2022 probably down to about $6.5 billion. But I'll say this it doesn't seem logical to us that that was their intent and if it was just a subset of the R&D, we still see a path to getting north of $7 billion. So we're still working through this.So just to summarize north of $7.7 billion if it's -- the way things have been operating in the past. If this R&D tax bill kicks in it will be probably in the mid-range of $6.5 billion. And if it's a subset of that, we still see north of $7 billion. But operationally we're still -- it's going to generate a lot of cash. We still have a focus on working capital.You talked about CapEx, you're right it was a little light this year. So we ended the year at roughly $1.5 billion. Because of the things we've discussed in the past, the buildings that we're building in the business areas. We'd see CapEx in 2020 at about $1.7 billion next year probably comparable about $1.7 billion. And then what we know today, it would start tapering down. It will be below $1.7 billion.Last point you asked about was 2023 and beyond. Just talking about Sikorsky, you'll start seeing a lot of those programs going into production; you'll start seeing F-35. We'll continue to reduce contract assets so we see -- though I don't have an absolute number for you, we see strong cash flow generation out in that time period as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: Hey, thanks everyone. I won't ask you about 2025 and beyond if that's okay. I spare you from that for now. But in the context of all that cash coming in what about cash going out? Leverage is noticeably low; you highlighted returning 64% of free cash flow to shareholders. It's been higher in years past, but I know your stock's been lower in years past. So just how do you think about capital allocation going forward given all these dynamics?
Ken Possenriede: Sure. So let's start John. Let's start with 2020. For planning purposes, we're assuming share repos of about $1 billion we're assuming we do increase the dividend. For planning purposes that would $0.20 a quarter or $0.80 similar to what we -- per share what we did in 2019. So around numbers and eight-plus percent increase in the dividend, we do have another tranche of debt that matures in 2020 it's $1.250 billion I believe it's the second tranche of Sikorsky. For planning purposes, we're assuming we let that mature and pay it back. Our treasury organization is constantly looking at whether it makes sense to refi or look at our entire debt on the balance sheet, whether a debt exchange makes sense. We'll go through that through the year. We will be opportunistic like we were in the fourth quarter of last year, where it makes sense from a share repo standpoint. In fact, we did our first accelerated share repurchase program. It went very well in the fourth quarter last year. And as you recall 2018 with our stock price down, nothing to do with our fundamentals but with what was going on with the market. We were very opportunistic in terms of that.And so we'll see going forward where it makes sense to do that. What we didn't talk about is inorganic growth. Marillyn has – we meet at least eight times a year with the senior leadership team to look at a pipeline in terms of things that make sense for us to invest in or frankly to divest in.And as you said we do have the firepower on our balance sheet to go do that. I'll remind you that we got a credit rating increase by all three agencies. So with debt being cheap, if there is something out there from an inorganic standpoint that fits within where we think we need to go with our portfolio, we would be inclined to do that.
Marillyn Hewson: But I would just remind you that we really are happy with our current portfolio. We don't see any gaps right now. But we'll as Ken said, constantly keep a screen on it as we always do.
Operator: Next we'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Hi, George.
George Shapiro: A couple of questions. MFC and space backlog were up well north of 20%. Why isn't the growth rate greater in 2020? And then also if you can just go through the balance sheet a little bit. There was a big increase in inventories maybe partly offset by contract assets. And likewise accounts payable were way down maybe offset a little bit from liabilities. Maybe just walk through what's actually going on in the balance sheet as well? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: You bet, George. It’s Ken. I’ll handle that. So you asked about Space and Missiles and Fire Control and you're right. So our – we overachieved our orders planned this year by north of $20 billion. And two of the big drivers were exactly that Space and Missiles and Fire Control.But I think what you need to do is look at the detail of what some of those programs are. So at Missiles and Fire Control a big driver of what went into backlog would be THAAD KSA and PAC-3 Poland. And those will be multi-year programs going forward. So you will not see a burn down like some of the tactical strike weapons programs integrated air and missile defense backlog will take longer to convert to sales.Same with Space. Space is a platform business. And you have – recall I talked about in the past the, the multiyear, the three years of AWE we got. So we will not get an order this year on AWE. We also got some big orders on Orion and OPIR which would take longer to convert to sales.Regarding the balance sheet, you're right George. We did have some inventory growth in 2019. But the way we look at it, I kind of look at contract assets and inventory and frankly, put them together. So we actually had contract assets decrease in 2019 by roughly $400 million. Inventory for the year roughly grew $600 million.So I would say from an asset standpoint, we had 11% sales growth. Think of that as roughly $6 billion of sales growth from 2019 to 2020. We grew contracted assets and inventory by only $200 million.Going forward, we do see contract assets increasing in 2021. And we see working capital in 2020 growing by rough numbers it will be comparable, little bit more than this year. But remind you, we're growing sales by roughly $3.5 billion. So that's in-line with what we've had in the past.And then 2021, we see a marked improvement from a working capital standpoint. We will only grow working capital by say, $200 million. This is our plan today, but we'll continue to try to perform on that. And with our focus on working capital one of the main places that we will work is in contract assets in 2020 and 2021.
Operator: Next we go to you Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. Everybody has talked about cash flow. I'm more interested in kind of what you do with it because your net debt-to-cap is now 1.4, if you increase your dividend 10%.If you buy $1.5 billion in stock every year, you're basically going to burn through like $4 billion in debt. So, where are we going here over the next couple of years? Do you want this net debt-to-cap ratio to go below one, or are you going to deploy the cash? And if so, what are your relative priorities? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: So Cai, as I mentioned earlier, I think our priority is -- or from a plan standpoint, the debt on the balance sheet as it matures our plan would be to pay it off. We will certainly look at whether it makes sense to refi in this low interest rate environment. We certainly will look at talking to the owners of our stock as we go around this year to talk to our shareholders.What type of dividend increase is acceptable to them for them to continue to be interested in our stock, the last couple of years though, we've planned for $1 billion of share repos, we have overachieved. We've opportunistically in the last two years have bought back more stock than we planned. There is some likelihood, we would do that as well and that -- we'll decide on that.We talked about in the past about our portfolio as Marillyn mentioned, we're very pleased with our portfolio. But if something out there makes sense for us to acquire, we have the firepower to do that.If you look at the composition who owns our stock, it's almost 50%, our yield, investors. So we will certainly pay attention to our yield. Even with the high appreciation of our stock, we still have a very strong dividend yield relative to our share price. But I think the net is, we're not going to let cash -- we've demonstrated this over the last couple of years, we're not going to let cash sit on our balance sheet, we will use it.
Operator: And next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned: Thank you. Good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned: I wanted to go back to the F-35 sustainment? Because I wanted to make sure I understood how the math works out here, because if I think of in a broad sense and I'll put PBL aside for the moment. But if I think in a broad sense about sustainment activity being somewhat proportional to the fleet size and if, right now, you're still building out depots.So there's, I would think, a surge in sustainment work at the current time for that. And then, if you have to bring down dollars per flight hour over the next few years, how does this -- how do you get to a doubling or tripling of sustainment revenues in the next five years? I'm just trying to figure out how this all flows?
Ken Possenriede: Okay. You bet, Doug. So, yes, a lot going on. So, just for completeness this year, we see sustainment growing, not quite double digits, but close to double digits. So, there are roughly 21 bases that are stood up. We still have quite a few to stand up. We have a large number of 491 aircraft out in the fleet through year-end. We're going to deliver 140 aircraft this year, rough number's 160 next year; '22, 165 and then we'll start getting up to the 170, 175, 180 aircraft delivered. We'll continue, as you said, drive down the price per flight hour from roughly $35,000 to $25,000.What I'd like to remind you though is, half of that is the government cost, half of that is our cost, but you will still continue to need sparing. Marillyn mentioned the modernization work that is continuing. You will start to see, from a sales or revenue standpoint, more modernization sales and sustainment, once we have these depots up and sparing rather than the cost of standing up the depot. So, going forward, you will see a sizable ramp in modernization cost, where the customer working with us deems which aircraft it makes sense to modernize and then the spare of the fleet.
Operator: Next we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Okay. Thanks very much and good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Hi, Seth. Good morning.
Seth Seifman: Can you mention the outperformance on the orders this year? I guess, first of all, where do you expect to exit the year in terms of backlog relative to last December 31? And then, in Missiles and Fire Control, when do you anticipate that the margin rate there would stabilize and then maybe start to move in the other direction?
Ken Possenriede: Got you. Okay. So, we actually see what we know today, we see our backlog this year growing roughly $3 billion, $4 billion. If you think about our orders, orders this year will not -- probably not be as strong as they were in 2019, but you do have some notable orders this year. So, this year we have three F-16 production orders in 2020; Bulgaria, Taiwan, and Morocco. We'll definitize F-35 Lot 14 this year. In the fourth quarter, we have F-35 Lot 15. There is a variety of hypersonics awards that will come out this year. We have the Indian Navy MH-60R that will occur, the Seahawk, PBL. So, our book-to-bill the way we see it this year is a little bit over 1, it's 1.06. So, we will grow backlog this year to roughly 1.47, 1.48.Regarding Missiles and Fire Control, we've talked about this in the past; you do have the development program -- the classified development program that is kicking in. It will continue to grow for the next couple of years. We've talked about some of the risk retirements that we've had in the past. Some of those will not occur this year, but it's probably next year or the year after that we would see the -- our margins start to stabilize on Missiles and Fire Control. There will be other new prototype programs.So, if you think about hypersonics, especially in Missiles and Fire Control, it is strike hypersonics. We really were investing in the counter hypersonics, but we really haven't seen any orders there yet. Would not surprise us if we're put under contract this year and going forward for counter and those will be dilutive to margins as well.
Greg Gardner: Hey John, this is Greg. We're at the top of the hour. So, I think I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for some final thoughts.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks. Let me wrap it up and conclude the call today again by thanking our 110,000 Lockheed Martin employees for their remarkable efforts over the course of 2019 because it was a year that we delivered outstanding strategic operational and financial performance. Our corporation continues to excel and attributes we most value and that's providing critical solutions to our customers and returning value to stockholders.So, thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you with you at our next earnings call in April. John that concludes our call today.

These results reflect the continued strength of our core legacy programs with recent strategic wins contributing additional growth.Our focus on program execution and investments in long term growth capabilities have our team well positioned for the future. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide preliminary trending data for 2020.First, I'd like to begin by highlighting a few of the elements that drove our strong third quarter performance. Sales this quarter exceeded last year's third quarter by 6%. Year-to-date we are nearly 12% over our 2018 results.Missiles and Fire Control have the highest overall growth this quarter as deliveries of tactical and strike weapons, development work on new hypersonic programs, and PAC-3 missile production grew from last year.Our Aeronautics business area also saw strong sales growth in the F-35 development, sustainment and production and we increased our joint strike fighter deliveries to 28 aircrafts this quarter compared to 20 in last year's third quarter.Our space team saw a continued growth from recent strategic wins in their Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR contract, the GPS III satellite production program and new hypersonic wins in their portfolio.This quarter we added over $600 million to our backlog, which now exceeds $137 billion and has reached a record level for the 5th consecutive quarter. Our segment profit grew by comparable amounts with the third quarter results improving 5% over the 2018 third quarter, and we had a strong quarter of cash generation achieving $2.5 billion of cash from operations. We now have brought in over $5.8 billion of operating cash year-to-date, keeping us on pace to deliver at least $7.6 billion in cash from operations for the year.Our team continues to drive growth and performance in all financial metrics with a portfolio of products, technologies and services that are in great demand by our customers and which continue to provide long term value to stockholders.Turning to cash deployment during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved two key actions demonstrating our commitment to returning cash to stockholders. First, the dividend was increased by 9% to $2.40 per share quarterly and $9.60 annually, continuing our commitment to providing shareholders a strong dividend.Second, our share repurchase authority was increased by $1 billion, bringing our total repurchase authority to $3.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. The recent actions taken by our Board will position us to continue our shareholder friendly focus on returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.Turning back to our business areas, I will touch on some significant operational and strategic accomplishment in just a moment, but I want to first highlight a few of the notable new business wins and follow-on awards that have helped position us for long term growth.I’ll start this quarter with our Rotary and Mission Systems Organization. This integrated warfare systems and sensors line of business was selected by the U.S. Army to develop a Sentinel A4 radar system. The Sentinel A4 radar replaces the current A3 variant and will provide improved air and missile defense against low flying, unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles and other threats.The initial $280 million award is to develop and deliver 18 new A4 System. The army’s plan of record is to upgrade 199 A3 Radars, but use Sentinel A4s, with a total potential value of approximately $3 billion over the life of the contract, from sales to domestic and international customers.This strategic win provides the corporation with a new growth opportunity, building upon our successes in the Space Fence Long Range Discrimination Radar and Homeland Defense Radar programs, and I’m very pleased to add this program to our portfolio.RMS also announced the award of two contracts totaling over $500 million to evolve and improve the U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System for the Missile Defense Agency. Our command, control, battle management and communications contract or C2BMC a legacy program dating back over 15 years, received a $320 million award to enhance the MDA’s Ballistic Missile Defense System, integrating our long range discrimination radar and other new sensors into the solution, providing advanced tracking capabilities for emerging threats and further hardening the cyber security posture of the system. C2BMC is a cornerstone of the nation's layered air and missile defense network and we are excited to evolve this critical capability.Separately the Missile Defense Agency awarded RMS a $240 million contract to support the modeling and simulation framework for the Ballistic Missile Defense System. This new contract will test the operational effectiveness and performance of fielded ballistic missile defense equipment and evaluate new conceptual architectures to help ensure the war fighter receives the most effective solution possible.In Aeronautics, our F-35 teams received notification from the state department of the approval for the proposed foreign military sales to Poland. The notification includes the procurement of 32 conventional takeoff and landing or CTOL variant, with a total potential value of approximately $6 billion.The F-35 CTOL once deployed will integrate seamlessly with the Polish Air Forces existing 48 aircraft F-16 fleet and would replace aging fourth generation legacy aircrafts. We're proud of our long standing partnership with the Polish government and industry and look forward to continuing that relationship as we deliver this unrivaled fighter jet to this important NATO allay.Our F-35 team was also awarded a $2.4 billion IDIQ contract for continued sustainment support to provide initial spare parts for our U.S. Marine Corp, Navy and Air Force Aircraft, as well as for partner countries and other international customers over a two year period.Keeping with Aero, our F-16 program received a formal $800 million award for the production and delivery of 14 state of the art, Block 70 Fighter Jet to the Slovak Republic following the notification we discussed last year. The award brings our F-16 backlog to 30 aircraft with Bahrain and the Slovak Republic as our latest customer nation, and we are pleased to have the opportunity to help provide security products to these important allies. We are excited with the opportunities we see ahead of us in the F-16 pipeline and we look forward to building this remarkable aircraft for years to come.In Missiles and Fire Control, we received a $1.4 billion order to provide Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD interceptor support to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and this announcement brings the total awarded value of the KSA THAAD program to over $3.5 billion.Moving forward to our Space business area, we received a $2.7 billion award to deliver the first three Orion spacecraft to support NASA’s Deep Space Exploration objectives for the second order of 3 Orion vehicles planned in fiscal year 2022. Orion is the NASA’s spacecraft that will carry astronauts from earth to the moon and bring them safely home as part of the Artemis Lunar Exploration Program.NASA has expressed a commitment to land the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024 and Orion is the planned delivery vehicle. The goals of the Artemis program are to demonstrate new and innovative capabilities with the ultimate objective to provide the technologies and experiences to launch a mission to explore Mars in the 2030s.We're excited that the Orion has been identified as the space craft to deliver these brave astronauts to lunar and one day Martian orbits and bring them safely home to earth. And just after the close of the third quarter, our space business area received a $495 million award with a potential for over $1.2 billion of value on the Trident II program. The award is for the production and deployed system support for the Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile system, a program we've been leading for over 60 years.These announcements reflect the long-term investments we have made to develop new technologies, leading to new franchise programs and innovations to enhance legacy products providing us with the continued growth opportunity for the future.Turning briefly to budget, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 was an entered law during the third quarter and established increased spending levels for discretionary defense budgets and total national security spending for FY 20 and FY 21 efficiently eliminating the constraints imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011.Both chambers of Congress had advanced appropriations bills in support of this budget increases, and in both versions our programs are well supported. Final legislation approving these funds has yet to be passed and the federal government is currently operating under a short term continuing resolution for fiscal year 2020 that is set to expire on November 21.The CR limits the Department of Defense Authorization to previous fiscal year levels until an appropriations bill can be signed into law, but the large portion of our backlog were already funded from prior fiscal years. We do not expect any impact to our 2019 financial outlook from this current short term CR.Should the continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints be extended beyond November 21, we could experience some level of impact to our 2020 trending data depending on the duration of the CR.Moving on, I'd like to highlight several significant events form across the corporation that occurred during the past quarter, which demonstrate our strong operational performance. In missiles and Fire Control, we are excited by two expansions we are undertaking to accommodate planned growth in our tactical missile and air missile defense lines of business.In August we opened a new 30,000 square foot facility in Texas to support production of PAC-3 missiles, THAAD interceptors and guided multiple launch rocket systems.In September we broke ground on a new Long Range Fires Production facility in Arkansas which will add 70,000 square feet to the current property and allows us to accommodate increased production demand in our army tactical missile system and other Precision Fires Program.And in our Space business area this quarter, I was extremely proud to attend the official groundbreaking ceremony announcing Northern Alabama as our flagship location for the corporations hypersonic strike work, establishing a new facility for the engineering and manufacturing of hypersonic weapons. These three actions reflect our commitment to investing in legacy program, as well as emerging technology to support the current and future needs of our customers.In Rotary and Mission Systems, our Sikorsky team completed an extensive set of testing for our combat rescue helicopter to successfully achieve the milestone C decision moving the program into the low rate initial production phase of the contract. The joint Sikorsky and U.S. Air Force test team executed over 70 hours of envelope expansion flight, validating the modifications to the venerable Black Hawk platform that will allow it to perform its importance search and rescue mission.The U.S. Air force plan of record is to revive 113 helicopters with five aircrafts currently in various stages of production. With enhanced avionics, improved offensive and defensive capabilities, and a new fuel system that nearly doubled capacity, the combat rescue helicopter has now been deemed capable of fulfilling its crucial mission to save down war fighters anytime, anywhere around the world.With that, I'll turn the call over Ken.
Ken Possenriede: Thanks Marillyn and good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we have included with our earnings release today.Let’s begin with chart three and an overview of our results for the quarter.Sales segment operating profit, cash from operations and earning per share continued to be strong. We generated $2.5 billion of cash from operations and we continued our cash deployment actions in the quarter, returning nearly $830 million of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, and we grew our backlog to $137.4 billion representing the 5th consecutive quarter in a row of record backlog.Based on the strength of our third quarter performance, we've updated our financial metrics for 2019. In addition, we’ll be discussing how our performance this year is carrying over into 2020 with our preliminary financial trends.Turning to chart four, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the third quarter of this year with last year's results. As I mentioned earlier this year, for comparison purposes the third quarter of this year had 13 weeks in the accounting period, while last year’s third quarter had 14 weeks in the accounting period. Even without the extra week in the quarter, our results exceeded last year.Sale grew 6% compared with the same quarter last year to $15.2 billion continuing the strength we had in the first two quarters, while segment operating profit increased 5% over last year's levels to nearly $1.7 billion. Year-to-date all four business areas contributed to the significant increases in both sales and operating profits.On chart five we’ll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS of $5.66 was $0.52 or 10% higher than our results last year driven by operational performance.Moving on to chart six, we provide our revised outlook for 2019. With just one quarter left in the year, we are providing a point estimate of results for the entire year versus the ranges we have provided in previous quarters.We expect sales to be approximately $59.1 billion for the year, above the mid-point of guidance range we provided last quarter. At $6.4 billion our forecasted segment operating profit is above the mid-point of the guidance range last quarter, resulting in a 10.9% margin. This puts our sales approximately 10% above 2018 results and segment operating profit approximately 9% above last year.Moving on our FAS/CAS pension adjustment, it remains unchanged at a little less than $1.5 billion. Our earnings per share is expected to be around $21.55, above the high end of our pervious guidance range driven by a lower tax rate than earlier estimate and the continued performance across our businesses. Cash from operations remains at equal to or greater than $7.6 billion, which has increased in the first two quarters of 2019 from the $7.4 billion outlook in January.Chart seven provides a reconciliation of our earnings per share outlook this quarter compared to last quarter. Operational performance is expected to drive approximately $0.07 increase in the EPS from an advised outlook for segment operating profit as a result of higher sales volumes in our business area.Tax predominately makes up the remaining $0.48 in EPS with most of that increase coming from a lower tax rate as we continue to reflect the latest benefits from the city with the foreign derived intangible income deduction that we discussed earlier this year. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 13%. Together these changes represent an expected 55% improvement from the mid-point of the EPS range we provided last quarter to a new outlook of $21.55 per share.Chart eight shows our new outlook for sales by business area for the year. Our point estimate for sales outlook is above the midpoint point of our last guidance increase to $59.1 billion. On chart nine, we’ve provide a similar view of our new outlook for segment operating profit by business area for the year.Like our sales, segment operating profit is above the mid-point of the guidance range from last quarter. RMS is slightly above their mid-point and space’s latest outlook shows them exceeding the high end of their prior range.On chart 10 we provide a preliminary look at our 2020 trends. We expect our 2020 sales to be approximately $62 billion, 5% growth over our current outlook for 2019 sales. We expect our segment operating margin will be between 10.5% and 10.8%. This marginal level assumes similar performance in our legacy programs in all business areas, with some dilution from the continued growth in new start programs we have recently won.We estimate that our cash from operations will be equal to or greater than $7.2 billion, inclusive of our of our required $500 million pension contribution for next year. We also plan to have at least $1 billion in share repurchases, the same level as we expect to have in 2019, more than offsetting any planned share issuances in the year.And similar to 2019, we have a debt maturity coming the next year; its approximately $1.3 billion. Just to note, our 2020 trending data does not include any impact regarding the recent potential sanctions or other actions the government may take with respect to Turkey. We will continue to evaluate any potential impacts to our program.Moving to our FAS/CAS outlook, we expect our net 2020 FAS/CAS adjustment will be approximately $2.1 billion or about $600 million higher than the adjustments for 2019. This adjustment reflects the final phase of the planned freeze of our salary pension plans that we previously disclosed.This estimate assumes a discount rate at the end of the year of 3.25% or 100 basis points below the 2018 rates. Based on our performance to-date we are assuming a 15% return on our assets for the full year. And going forward we are maintaining our long term asset return assumption of 7% per year.And finally on chart 11, we have our summary. We've seen strong performance from all of our business areas this year and I'm especially pleased with our record backlog throughout the year. Our updated financial metrics anticipates strong full year results and we expect to see continued growth into 2020 based on our portfolio of legacy program, new wins and strategic investments that have continued to grow our backlog through the year and across our portfolio.And with that, we're ready for your questions. John.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And first from the line of Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Rich Safran: Marillyn, Ken, Greg, good morning! How are you?
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Rich Safran: So either Marillyn or Ken, a question on your 2020 guide with a few parts to it. You know you are guiding to 5% growth. You just covered that next year. Now, always to the best you can, could you discuss the segments you expect to see the most growth from next year? What the primary drivers are, the 5% growth and where you see some possible upside? And on margins, I just wanted to ask. Your guide for next year just seems a little bit light relative to where expectations were and I thought maybe you could discuss what's driving that? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: You bet, thanks Rich. It’s probably best I take that question and if you don’t mind Rich, I’ll give you some color and you can go across all business areas.So I'll start with Aero. You know next year we see mid-single digit growth across the business areas for Aeronautics. F-35 – we see growth on F-35 similar to the Aero growth, that mid-single digits.Development and sustainment, we see that growing faster than production. We see strong growth at IFG and that’s specifically F-16. You heard Marillyn mention we’ve got the Slovak Republic order behind us, we are now starting to build [indiscernible] Jets that we’ll start delivering out in late 2021 and we’ve got strong [mod] [ph] work there.And we also see strong growth at Skunk Works. If you recall, we talked about the classified program we won. The Skunk should grow double digit sales next year.And finally for Aeronautics, at AMMM, no surprise. We see sales decline in 2020 compared to 2019. If you recall we are going to deliver 28 C-130s this year, forecasting around 25 next year and a reduction in 2021 to about 23. So you’ll see mid-single digits decline in sales there, so just to summarize again for Aeronautics, mid-single digit growth.At Missiles and Fire Control, it will be our fastest growing business area again. We see low mid-digit growth. We see strong growth at strike weapons specifically in precision fires and JASSM we also see strong growth in integrated Air and Missile Defense and that would THAAD and PAC-3.At RMS we see low single digit growth. We're finally starting to see some strong growth at Sikorsky. Think of that as MH-60 combat search and rescue and the presidential helicopters VH-92 programs. That will more than offset. We see declines in our IWSS business. Think of that as Littoral Combat Ship and the domestic piece of Aegis.And in space we see growth, which last year at the time we would not have seen [indiscernible] we were going to see growth at space. And if you recall we talked about our strong order book this year and the lion share of that up-side was at space and we are continuing to see that in the future.The upsides are in hypersonics programs and think of the space transportation segment of that business, so Orion and [OPIR] [ph]. OPIR is growing and that is slightly offsetting declines and think of some of our historical programs that are starting to wind down like [indiscernible] and Advanced [DHS] [ph]. So net, we see roughly 5% growth for the corporation.Going to profit margins, we see Aeronautics having similar margins as they did in 2019. F-35 profits will grow at the same rate as sales, so think of that as mid-single digit. As I mentioned with sales, development sustainment is growing faster than production and therefore dilutive in nature.I mentioned the Skunk’s. So the Skunk’s is growing. Their profit, their absolute profit dollars will be growing, but that is also dilutive in nature, so you'll see basically mid-single digits at Aeronautics.Missiles and Fire Control, we see right now less risk retirement in 2020 than we saw in 2019, and as we've talked about the classified program that we won and that will continue to grow as will other development programs ramping-up so that they have dilutive margin. Missiles and Fire Control we see overall we’ll have lower margins in 2020 than in 2019.RMS – we are seeing similar to or slightly higher margins in 2020 compared to 2019. That’s driven by our training business and our Sikorsky piece of the business.And finally at Space, we also see like Missiles and Fire Control less risk retirements are forecasted in 2020 and also the new program starts. And on ULA, we see similar earnings in 2020 as we did in 2019.So overall also we see space like Missiles and Fire Control will have lower margins in 2020 than we had in 2019. Hopefully, that gave you enough color Rich.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Great, thanks. Good morning! Marillyn I was hoping you could talk about the F-35 and in the context of any risk you are managing around Turkey. Obviously, you've excluded it from the guidance, but Ellen Lord I think this week mentioned that Lockheed is actually the agent for reassigning the work that might be or is being sourced outside of what's being done instead of Turkey to other players. Can you clarify for us if that means that Lockheed is just the agent for resourcing network or if there's any risk that you are carrying in that transition as well?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question Myles and I think probably the broader answer beyond just F-35, I’ll ask you Ken maybe to weigh in on the balance of the portfolio, because we’ve had some questions from others about it. This might be a good time to cover Turkey all up.But as you know, back in July the Department of Defense announced the exclusion of Turkey from the F-35 program and that included the in-country suppliers, with the target date of March of 2020. So we’ve been working closely with the U.S. government for several months for quite some time on establishing alternate sources of supply in the United States to be able to quickly take the place of the current contributions that Turkey is providing to the program in terms of components and parts, etcetera, and all throughout that we continue to evaluate our supply chain.We are you know or as the prime contractor for those sources of supply, we are doing that work, yes. I mean if that’s – if I’ve understood you question, do we have the responsibility? We do, and we're working with, of course we have some major contractors that have work in country as those Pratt & Whitney which we don't oversee. Pratt & Whitney has their own responsibility for that.So we are the agents reassigning the work and we've been working on it for some time. But in terms of the risk associated with it, we have a contract modification from the U.S. government that covers all that risk. Because this is a decision by the U.S. government to take Turkey out of the program and so for that purpose, even though we are the ones that are reassigning the work, we have coverage from the contract at the same point.Ken, I think it might be helpful also to kind of give some color on the rest of the work that we have in Turkey at this point.
Ken Possenriede: You bet. Good morning Myles. You know we had the disclaimer in our earnings release talking about you know 2020 no impact to our related to Turkey. Let me just give you some color and I’ll take about four areas.So the first one is and this is, one of it is related to F-35 so its exports and so this is the delivery of aircraft to Turkey for the F-35 program and that's by far the largest item here. And I think you know our F-35 contract with Turkey is a partner agreement, so you know they are one of the partner countries through the U.S. government.We have - the U.S. government has documented that Lockheed Martin will not absorb any impact from planes we’ve built or are currently building for Turkey. So we believe we are covered here, and I’m sure you saw on our balance sheet some growth in our contract assets. Part of that growth is because we're still working through with the U.S. government to get a contract mark from them for this work, so we can bill and collect for that. Other exports to Turkey from the other business areas really are not material, so there's really no impact to us there.The second item is we have a few Turkish military programs that would be impacted by any continuing imposition of the sanctions and work returns, currently reviewing them to determine the financial impact; and one of which is we have a – it could potentially have to get back a cash advance, an advance payment that's not material in nature and we do know that any inability to perform due to U.S. government sanctions, we would have a backlog adjustment. Think of that as about $900 million you know ball park, that’s in $1 billion, but that’s more a you know a book keeping element at this stage, but net-net on these Turkish military programs for 2020, we don't see any real impact to sales, our profits or our cash, even the cash advances, it would not be material to us.The third area is we have a joint venture in Turkey with a company called the Alpata Group; it’s the Alp Aviation. Think of that as Alp manufacturers finished precision parts and mechanical assemblies and have scope for the F-35 and Black Hawk production, and we have an equity stake in this joint venture and think of that as about $40 million.We also recognize equity earnings and they are less than $10 million a year, so really not a large amount. So you know at this time if Alp would be prohibited from selling component parts to the Ministry of National Defense, however unless reciprocal sanctions are implemented, Alp should be able to continue to sell component parts to support this. They won't be for F-35; we're working through that. This is for Pratt & Whitney components, we’re working through that. So right now we don't think to be a material impact there either.And then the last one is the Turkish suppliers that are actually supporting U.S. programs and that's more than just F-35. So you know the way the sanctions are written, transactions and activities for the conduct of the official business of UST by Lockheed Martin, they'd still be authorized. But independent of the sanctions we're still working second source supply contract as Marillyn mentioned and they are underway and we are working that to wind those down in the 2020 time period.And as Marillyn mentioned, we've been partnering closely with the U.S. government and our supply chain to minimize the impact on the F-35 program. We've been working hard to establish alternate sources of supply in the U.S. The first – second choices will all be U.S. based to quickly as possible to accommodate Turkey's current contributions for the program and we’ll continue working with the U.S. government to understand any potential impacts.Lastly, you know even if the current sanctions are lifted, we’re mindful of the potential for congressional legislation or the implication of CAATSA, which is the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act related to Turkey’s purchase and that’s due to the S-400 system, but we’d speculating at this time at any impacts at this point. So hopefully that helped to answer the question.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies; please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning Marillyn and Ken! Thank you very much.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: In the past you've talked about a three year cash flow target and with operating cash flow bought in 2020 expansion contribution. How do we think about the longer term drivers of free cash flow and the off-set in ‘21 given a pension step-up and just moving pieces on CapEx and working capital. I’m asking you to build a model Ken, so.
Ken Possenriede: Okay, thanks Sheila. You know so if you go back, I think Bruce [ph] teased us up about a year ago and what he saw you know based on what we did on our long range plan, about $7 billion – he said $7 billion in 2020, 2021 and you know right now as we see $7.2 billion with inclusive of the $500 million pension contribution. I’ll remind everybody, that’s up about $300 million.The pension contribution is up about $300 million due to the returns we had in 2018. So we've done a nice job working our way through working capital and I mentioned you know six months ago, seven months ago that that’s a priority of ours this year.You know the best we could see this year right now for 2021 and 2022, we will be north of $7 billion. Not sure how much north of $7 billion, but we’ll be north of $7 billion and right now it looks like our pension contribution is out in 2021 and 2022 based on you know the assumptions we’ve made would be about $2 billion in pensions.So again, I think we've done a nice job of continuing to grow our cash and you know we'll refine that over the next couple of months and when we give you guidance in January.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning everyone.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: So just coming back to the 2020 revenue outlook, you know it's a company that grew revenue in a lot of years in the past; five to seven or outlay growth was negative. You know you had this type of growth where you were projecting a 5% type growth rate, 2016, 2017 when outlays were still declining. You know you did something closer to 10, 2018, 2019 when the bookings really started to ratchet up and you've now got the trailing 12 month book-to-bill and the recent backlog growth basically is as good as it's ever been in history the company, trailing 12 month Book-to-bill at 1.5.So unless it is a longer dated backlog than ever or if there's just a handful of specific programs that come out of the P&L completely in 2020 that were already out of the backlog, you gave a pretty extensive list of new wins recently in the prepared remarks. I'm just struggling mightily to match up this backlog change with this revenue growth projection.
Ken Possenriede: Well Noah, its Ken. I think I'll take this and I'll try to relieve your struggling the best I can. So you know we talked about backlog. We see back log into this year. Probably it's going to continue to grow based on the orders we believe we're going to receive in the fourth quarter, the biggest one being into the block by once we get that definite size and we're very close, so we’ll be…
Noah Poponak: So it is going to grow again in the fourth quarter?
Ken Possenriede: Yeah, so $140 billion – we’ll be up to about $140 billion and you look at the increase we had this year over what our plan was, think of that as about $17 billion. Think of the $17 billion, about $7.5 billion of that were pull-in’s from 2020 into 2019; think of that as the advance AWE.We got three years’ worth of quarters this year rather than the one, so that piece is longer. Think of the block by, which is overall $35 billion give or take. That'll be over a three year period. We're going to get to multi-year three in the fourth quarter for the C-130. That is over a longer period of time.If I go back to the $17 billion, the remainder is about $9.5 billion. Those are just pure upsides that we did not plan for. So we have guided from the start of the year to now, increased our guidance by $2.6 billion. Think of that $2.6 billion came from the $9.5 billion of upside of orders that we had and back to your comment, in the $140 billion, the gestation period if I could call it that, is a longer period than we have historically seen.
Operator: Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi; please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: Hey, thanks everyone and good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Hi Jon.
Jon Raviv: Marillyn, what is your – kind of a broad question here, but what's your perspective on your position in the industry. I get the sense that there's always some shifts in terms of industrial structure, in terms of who is the platform provider, a platform integrator and technology enabler. Any perspectives on that kind of dynamic and what that means for your – you know when you say long term growth, you know what is that, is that 22 or do we have a line of sight a little bit beyond that at this point. Thank you.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question Jon. I guess you know as I look at where we are today, I mean we have transitioned our portfolio over the last few years, several years, toward a more platform provider. We used as you would call, IS & GS, which was a very strong services component of the portfolio. At the time that we divested that element, we brought in Sikorsky, a platform based program. You know in addition to that, of course we got our sensors, our tactical missiles even though sometimes a lot of components that go on those platforms, but if you just look at it from that standpoint you could even argue to some extent that those are the platforms.When you look at the growth for the company, F-35 of course is going to be a major element of growth for the next five to 10 years. We know that from ramping up production for the payment of the aircraft. But in addition to that, when you look at Sikorsky, the CH-53K, the combat rescue helicopter, even the presidential helicopter are all programs that'll be into production and our platforms for us going forward. We've got – we're looking forward to downstream from hypersonics production that we hope will ramp up. You know we got a lot of developmental wins that we’ve had and we expect to be moving more into production there.Future of Vertical Lift is another area. When you look at the light and medium lift helicopters that we're competing for on Future of Vertical Lift platform based, our F-16 resurgence, as you heard from Ken, you know we were able to get a handshake agreement on our multiyear three for the C-130J in the last month or so; Orion, which again is another important platform in the Space exploration arena.So you know that to us, that is where the elements of growth are and certainly on those platforms we do more than just the frames with our systems and sensors and weapon systems, etcetera that are part of our overall; that's pretty important.When you look at just the area of missile defense side, what we’re doing on PAC-3, on THAAD, all of the growth that we see in those arenas, as well as you know Aegis Systems and so I would just argue that you know for us that’s the growth. They all come with autonomy and AI and you know software development elements of them. So those are important and I just – I don't – I want to put stomp again. It’s a big win we just had on the Sentinel A4 radar. I mean that was a great win for us as a company to go along with several other radars that we have. So hopefully that answers your question Jon.
Operator: Next we’ll go to David Strauss with Barclays; please go ahead.David Strauss, your line is open. If you’re on mute possibly?
David Strauss: Hi, can you hear me?
Ken Possenriede: We can, yes. Hi David!
David Strauss: Okay, great, great, thanks for thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to ask you about your guidance for the full year for ‘19 since it implies a pretty big margin step down in the fourth quarter. It looks like somewhat close to you know kind of high 9% to 10% for the segments. Can you touch on that?And then also on your operating cash flow outlook, as we think about ‘20 and ’21, can you talk a little bit about working capital? The best I can tell, it seems to imply not much of a working capital improvement in – you know there’s a fairly big working capital burn in ‘20 again also, but you know also the working capital build in ’19. Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: You bet! Okay David, its Ken, I'll take that. So I’ll go around the business areas for the fourth quarter on margins. So at aeronautics, we’re seeing similar margins that we’ve basically had for the rest of the year, so I think that aeronautics is in line with the rest of the year.Missiles and Fire Control, your right, it is down, and if you recall what we talked about in the first and the second quarter, we had step-ups of risk retirement planned in the third and the fourth quarter and based on where we were in the production cycle of those products, it made sense for us to do those risk retirements earlier in the year than later in the year. And if you compare that to last year from a timing standpoint, we had more step-ups in the fourth quarter than we’re going to have this year. So it’s just basically timing of you know the production cycle on missiles and Fire Control.RMS is like aeronautics. Its similar sales growth, similar profit growth, so that's in line with pretty much with what we've done in previous years. And then lastly Space, it’s similar to missiles and Fire Control and I’ll give a plug to our Advanced EHF program. They are having an absolute tremendous year. They had enormous risk retirements in the year and we're just not going to replicate that out in the fourth. Also ULA earnings will be lower in the fourth quarter this year compared to earlier and last year.And then on cash, so you know I think I have a different view David. We are going to reduce working capital significantly in fourth quarter. We had to build-up in the first half of the year and in the third quarter we only grew working capital by $30 million and line of site for 2020 right now with the 5% growth, we're only see growing working capital by about a $100 million and most of that will be in contract assets and in inventory.So as we continue to focus on working capital, we are seeing the improvements here and that’s why we too our trend data from $7 billion to $7.2 billion and when Sheila asked the question for the out years, we see a line of site of doing better than what we forecasted in 2021 and 2022 on cash basis, relative to what we disclosed last year.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company; please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much. So you’ve had a lot of good growth in terms of wins and hypersonics; you mentioned Skunk Works. Can you give us some numbers in terms of what percentage is classified work of your sales today and the expected growth rate next year and then kind of tied into this whole issue, some of us has felt that the sales growth number would be a little bit higher for next year. If you were going to have an opportunity in sales next year where would it be? Thanks so much.
Ken Possenriede: You bet Cai. Yeah, unfortunately our customer frowns upon us, spiking at our classified. But what I can say is you know just based on what we're seeing and what I described earlier, you know because of the Skunk’s and because of the classified program at Missiles and Fire Control, they are growing faster than the corporation and I would say that is one of the opportunities that we do have.I'd say the other opportunity and again I think I gave color on the last call in terms of hypertonic sales. So we see sales this year in hypertonic around $600 million. Best of what we see today, best of our ability to what we see today is for next year hypersonic round numbers, it's about $1 billion. But just for everybody's benefit, these are not for the most part program of record.As Marillyn mentioned, we are still in the prototype phase and we’ll start doing first launches starting next year out into it 2022. It is possible that you know because of the investments we've made in strike’s hypersonics and in counter hypertonics, which really haven't been any program yet on counter hypersonics.There is some likelihood we may see some opportunities there in counter hypertonics as well. So it could be in classified and it could be in counter hypertonics.
Marillyn Hewson: I would just add, you know when you look at growth, I mean this year we are planning to deliver 131 F-35. It’s going to ramp up to over 140 and so that still continues to be our big growth area and then as mentioned earlier the Sikorsky program was CH-53K and CRH and the combat rescue helicopter and our missile defense was PAC-3 and THAAD. Those are the key growth areas as we look at them and continue to grow in F-16, C-130, as well as the hypertonics growth.So we got a lot of solid growth programs. I think you know strong 5% growth is you know as I look over the history of our corporation over the last 10 years, I feel really good about the growth that we are seeing as we go into 2020.
Operator: Our next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yeah! Good morning Marillyn and Ken. Ken, I guess this question is for you. We're really testing your long-term forecasting here. But I guess when I look at Aeronautical margins, if we look back at the last cycle you know, the segment kind of peak around with F-22 production, and you know does the same apply here when we're thinking about F-35 deliveries or is this now changing just given the growth you're highlighting with Skunks and some of the sustainment work that's ramping. Just maybe, just a profile of how you think about margin profiles in the improvements that we kind of evolve in the forecasting? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: You bet. So Peter, thanks for the question. Yeah, I'll start with 2020. Again, it just summarized that we're seeing similar margins at Aeronautics next year than we saw this year. I'd say you got the sustainment which as we've mentioned, and you probably seen in the press, will continue to grow, but for the most part of annual buys, and we put a proposal, an unsolicited proposal on the table for a 5 year PBL. So think of that as performance-based logistics.There is some interest in the government; we're working through that now, socializing that now. That would give us an opportunity for sustainment and not be dilutive to margins, and so think of that as we're putting more risk on industry, so industry would invest, industry would commit to the metrics and with that there should be additional rewards.So I think the opportunity also in Aeronautics would be as once these classified program in the Skunk’s starts getting multiple customers and it starts going into production. There should be some margin improvement there that could be similar to margins on the rest of Aeronautics that would help with some margin expansion there.And as I've mentioned earlier on the F-35 production deals, we feel good with the deals we're getting with the customer. We think they're fair and reasonable, they're balanced and we're now going through some housekeeping on the Block buy and hopefully we have that definitized in the next week or two, and we'll start performing on that. And if we perform, there is opportunity for margin expansion there as well.
Operator: Next we'll go to Carter Copeland with Melius Research; [lease go ahead.
Carter Copeland: Hey, thanks for the time. Just a couple, just quick ones here in the interest of time. One, Ken, on the program charge you called out in the release on MFC, was that related to the same program you guys have disclosed before or was that something new?And then secondly on the F-16 pipeline, what – you know from a production rate standpoint or I guess aggregate volume standpoint, what do you see beyond what you've talked about here and the 30 aircraft and potentially going to other customers? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: Thanks Carter. I'll hit the second one first and then I'll do the charge, because that will be probably a less of a long-winded answer.So F-16, you know right now in backlog as Marillyn mentioned, we have 30 aircraft. First one gets delivered, Bahrain gets delivered. I had to be in the same country by last day of the year of 2021. We see production build of roughly one month. Right behind that we're hopeful – you've probably seen in the press, Bulgaria. Bulgaria once – it looks like they won eight aircraft, so we're in the process of working through that.In our plan we see countries like Morocco and other countries out in the Far East that in aggregate could grow our backlog by another 60 aircraft, and if you think through that, that will start ramping up that production line to three a month.There is other interest out there, the countries in the Middle East. There is discussion about another country in the Far East that could want as many as 66, and we'll see where that goes, but all those aircraft would be built in Greenville and right now we think we have capacity to build four a month, and like I said, we'll start with one a month and that would be frankly good problem to have.The other wild card is, we've announced our Indian variant that we're going to propose, which is the F-21. We're going to build that airplane in India if we're fortunate enough to win that program, but that program would be worth $10 billion to $15 billion, so great opportunity out there. There is other mod work out there as well, that there are customers that will elect to keep their current aircraft and will modify those aircraft, so we see a great future for F-16.Regarding the charge we took at Missiles and Fire Control, it actually is – it is actually a different program than what we had. It was a modest charge and we think from a performance standpoint with balance sheet reserves and the charge we took, we think we won't be talking about that program anymore.
Operator: Our next question is from Joe DeNardi with Stifel; please go ahead.
Joe DeNardi: Yeah, thanks, good afternoon. Maybe Marillyn or Ken, I think it seems like international demand for F-35 has maybe pleased you guys positively or had been a positive surprise of late as the prices come down there. Can you just talk about what the pipeline looks there?And then what the conversations are with the DoD in terms of what peak production would be? I think at one point there were some discussion about taking it to 182 to 185, just a little more color there. Thank you.
Ken Possenriede: Sure, I'll take that Joe. So yeah, we are very happy with where the F-35 program is going internationally. You saw Japan announced an additional 105 aircraft, on top of the aircraft they originally committed to. Singapore has announced an interest in buying the aircraft. It will be for a modest amount to start, but that's a great start.And Japan actually said they want to buy some Bs [ph]. It's likely Singapore who will buy some Bs. We're pleased with the award we got for Belgium for 34 aircraft. We are in a competition now for Finland and Switzerland, will continue to shape those and you're exactly right we got to the $80 million aircraft earlier than we thought. It's in lot 13 which will certainly help with those opportunities.We're in the competition with Canada, which could buy up to 100 aircraft. We're feeling good about that. We don't think we're out of the German competition yet, so we're still continuing to shape that. We heard about Poland. Poland wants to buy 32 aircraft, so we think there is a strong pipeline out there for the F-35.Regarding capacity, you got it, right. So if you look at the FACO the final assembly and checkout at Fort Worth, the one in Italy and the one in Japan, we see capacity right now as we continue to build that out in Fort Worth to be about 180, 185 aircraft. So we got ways to go.
Greg Gardner: Hey John, this is Greg. I think we’ve come up on the top of the hour here, so I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for some final thoughts.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks Greg. Well, let me just end by restating that we really completed another strong quarter of financial and operational performance, and as you heard we have a record backlog, we are focused on program execution and with a strong demand for our portfolio of products and services. We believe we're well positioned for a successful closure of 2019 and continued growth in 2020.So we appreciate you all joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call in January. John, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-24 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Lockheed Martin’s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will turn the call now over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, John and good morning. I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Ken Possenriede, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Statements made in today’s call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today’s press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we have planned to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today on our second quarter 2019 earnings call as we review our quarterly results and increased financial outlook for 2019. As today’s release details, we had a very strong quarter financially, strategically and operationally. As you will see from some of the performance highlights and quarterly achievements that I will discuss in a few minutes, we have a remarkable team, dedicated and talented employees who are designing, developing and producing innovative solutions for our customers and I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to them.Before I discuss the quarter in depth, I would like to take a moment to comment on the recent announcements regarding the decision by the U.S. government to suspend Turkey from the F-35 program. The U.S. government made this difficult decision and as always we will continue to follow any official guidance as it relates to the delivery of the F-35 to Turkey or the export of goods from the Turkish supply chain. Although the current program of record for total deliveries to Turkey is 100 planes, the quantities included for them in the recent lot 12 through 14 handshake agreement were a modest 8 aircraft per year. Also, Lockheed Martin has been partnering closely with the U.S. government and our supply chain to minimize the impact to the F-35 program. Over the last several months, we have been working to establish alternate sources of supply in the United States to quickly accommodate Turkey’s current contributions to the program. These actions should limit any future production or sustainment impact and we remain on track to meet our commitment of delivering 131 F-35s this year. As F-35 in the fleet deliver exceptional capability and as cost continue to come down, we see increasing global demand for the F-35 that will grow the total program of record. We believe the F-35 program remains healthy and is performing exceptionally well for all of its stakeholders. We will discuss the F-35 in more detail later on the call.Moving back to our quarterly results, the Corporation continues to perform with excellence, driving outstanding growth and strong financial results and create value for stockholders. This performance from across the Corporation and expectations for the remainder of 2019 enables us to increase our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. All four of our business areas experienced growth this quarter and each has contributed to our updated full year outlook reflecting the outstanding performance of our entire team. Our backlog has continued to increase and is again at a record level. Our broad portfolio and long-term growth opportunities have us well positioned to deliver outstanding value for our stockholders.I will touch on a few of our financial achievements upfront and Ken will discuss our results in more detail a little later on the call. We grew sales again this quarter exceeding last year’s second quarter by 8% with each business area increasing revenues from the second quarter of 2018. The growth was led by missiles and fire control from ramping production rates for tactical and strike weapons particularly precision fires as well as from increased sales in new hypersonics and classified programs. Our space organization also experienced strong sales growth with the Overhead Persistent Infrared and GPS III contracts, two programs we won last year contributing to year-over-year increases. The space, strategic and missile defense line of business also contributed to increased revenues because of strong volume in new hypersonic programs being performed in this business area.Our segment profit increased by 6% year-over-year as strong performance across the Corporation contributed to the growth. As with sales, missiles and fire control and space led the way with improved operational performance and the growth in revenues I just discussed driving the increases. These outstanding results in sales and earnings and our focus on cost reductions and operational efficiencies also allowed us to increase our full year outlook for cash from operations to at least $7.6 billion. Our portfolio of products and services is well aligned with our customers’ needs with both our legacy solutions and new technologies in high demand. Our heritage of innovation and performance remains strong and we are excited by our long-term growth opportunities.I will discuss some significant performance milestones in just a moment, including a tremendous honor bestowed upon our F-35 team. But first, I would like to highlight a few key orders and award activities that demonstrate the value of our broad portfolio. In aeronautics, our F-35 organization and the Department of Defense announced a handshake agreement for the production of lots 12, 13 and 14 aircraft, totaling 478 jets. Once finalized, this contract will represent the largest F-35 production contract to-date and will mark the largest procurement in the history of the Defense department. I would like to express my thanks to both the Pentagon’s joint program office and the Lockheed Martin F-35 team for the outstanding coordination and cooperation they have shown in arriving at this historic agreement.Importantly, with this agreement, we now offer the Lot 13 F-35A model at a unit price below our longstanding objective of $80 million, thereby achieving this target 1 year earlier than planned. Through relentless focus on cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies, across the F-35 enterprise, we can now offer this remarkable fifth generation fighter at a price equal to or lower than legacy fourth generation aircraft making this platform the best value fighter jet available in the world. We are proud to be able to provide this unrivalled stealth fighter to our nation’s war fighters, our partners and international customers and we look forward to finalizing this agreement in the coming months.In our space business area, our team continued to build on its previous Hacksaw and conventional prompt strike hypersonic wins. During the second quarter, we were selected as the prime contractor for the long-range hypersonic weapon system integration effort in support of the army hypersonic projects office. In addition, our space organization is part of the team led by Dynetics that was selected by the U.S. Army for the common hypersonic glide body prototype contract. We anticipate that both of these opportunities will be negotiated in the next few months and when finalized would bring the potential value of all of the hypersonic contracts across the corporation, including those awards we discussed on our last earnings call to over $3.5 billion.Moving to Missiles and Fire Control, we received several contract awards in our tactical missile line of business, totaling over $1.6 billion which led to a quarterly book-to-bill 2.0. The three separate awards were for Hellfire Missiles, Atacms Missiles and the recapitalization of Multiple Launch Rocket System equipment in support of the U.S. Army and international customers as demand for strike weapons continues. In Rotary and Mission Systems, our Sikorsky team was awarded $1.1 billion contract from the U.S. Navy for 12 CH-53K low rate initial production or LRIP 2 and 3 heavy lift helicopters. These aircraft are part of the Navy’s 200 helicopter plan of record with deliveries beginning in early 2022. We anticipate production will continue beyond the 2030 timeframe providing long-term growth opportunities well into the future.Sikorsky was also awarded the first LRIP contract for the VH-92A Presidential helicopter. This $540 million order follows an affirmative milestone C decision this past May and includes the first 6 aircraft of the total 23 unit plan of record. Sikorsky has been producing helicopters to transport every U.S. President and Commander-in-Chief since Dwight D. Eisenhower and we are proud to build on this heritage to deliver this remarkable product for years to come. These announcements reflect the strength of our legacy products and services as well as the demand for new solutions and platforms that are coming online. Our heritage of investment and innovation and operational performance has positioned us well to perform for our customers and drive future growth.Moving briefly to defense budgets, it was announced yesterday that the President and the House and Senate leadership have reached a broad agreement on FY ‘20 National Defense Funding proposing spending levels that would be a compromise between the DoD request and the House Bills that have been approved and would represent an increase from the current FY ‘19 enacted values. Importantly, this agreement supports removing the restrictions placed on defense spending by the 2011 Budget Control Act caps for both FY ‘20 and FY ‘21 fiscal years. This action once passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law would remove the prospect of automatic spending reductions known as sequestration and raise the final 2 years of budget ceilings, providing crucial near-term funding visibility for our national security objectives. We will await the details of this bipartisan action. We believe this is an encouraging step in the process to continue to provide the support for the recapitalization of our national defense assets and the investment in our country’s defense.Moving on I would like to just highlight several significant events that occurred across the Corporation during the past quarter. First, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to our F-35 organization for being part of the automatic ground collision avoidance system, or Auto GCAS team that was awarded the 2018 Robert J. Collier Trophy in April. The Collier Trophy is presented annually to recognize the greatest achievement in aerospace in America. This award celebrated the Auto GCAS team, a collaborative group from industry and government, including the Air Force, the F-35 Joint Program Office, NASA, the Defense Safety Council and our Lockheed Martin F-35 organization for successfully completing a rapid design and implementation of life saving technologies for the worldwide F-35 fleet. This system improves the safety of aircraft in pilots using a set of complex collision avoidance and autonomous decision-making algorithms, pushing the boundaries of autonomy and artificial intelligence. This technology has already been credited for 7 F-16 sales and the F-35 enterprise accelerated the implementation of the software 7 years ahead of schedule. Lockheed Martin companies and employees, including Glenn L. Martin and Kelly Johnson have won or been part of the winning team for this prestigious honor over a dozen times since the first Collier Trophy was awarded in 1911. And I am extremely proud that our F-35 team again joins this distinguished group of innovators.Moving to Missiles and Fire Control, our tactical and strike missile line of business achieved this key milestone this quarter on the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW hypersonic missile program. In June, our team and the U.S. Air Force successfully completed a captive carry flight test of the ARRW weapon on the service of the B-52 Stratofortress bomber mounting the missile below the aircraft’s wings to gather data on drag and vibrations. The ARRW missile successfully passed the preliminary design review in March, and this captive carry test is the most recent step in the Air Force’s rapid prototyping strategy to mature this hypersonic weapon.In Rotary and Mission Systems, our Sikorsky team celebrated a key milestone with the first flight of our combat rescue helicopter, the latest rotorcraft designed to perform critical search and rescue operations for the U.S. Air Force. This aircraft based on the venerable UH-60M Black Hawk provides a significant increase in capabilities from previous rescue helicopters with extended range, more effective defensive systems, cyber security and weaponry that all lead to improved survivability. The program continues to be on schedule and this successful first flight paves the way for a Milestone C decision later this year to move the platform from the development phase into production. The program of record calls for 113 of these modernized aircrafts. And we look forward to providing this crucial rescue helicopter to help ensure the air force fulfills its mission to leave no one behind.I will close with our space business area, whose Orion team took another remarkable step in returning astronauts to the moon with their successful demonstration of a crucial launch safety system, which completed just after the close of the quarter. Orion is part of the backbone for our nation’s plan for deep space exploration and NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface by 2024. Lockheed Martin Space, the prime contractor producing Orion spacecraft for NASA designed and built the state-of-the-art escape system to safely pull the crew module and astronauts away from a life threatening event during the launch. In this event known as the Ascent Abort Flight test, the vehicle rose to an altitude of 3,100 feet where it experienced the high stressed aerodynamic conditions expected during early flight and within milliseconds, the Abort system initiated a series of maneuvers that propelled the test version of the Orion capsule away from the rocket and into a safe descent. This test marks an important milestone as the nation celebrates the 50th anniversary of man’s first lunar landing and now prepares for a return of human space flight. We are proud to continue our legacy in space exploration by supporting the Orion program and delivering the safest spacecraft ever built.With that, I will turn the call over to Ken. Ken?
Ken Possenriede: Thanks, Marillyn and good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments please follow along with the web charts that we have included with our earnings release today.Let’s begin with Chart 3 in an overview of our results for the quarter. We exceeded our expectations for every financial metric in the second quarter carrying forward the strong performance from the first quarter. After generating $1.7 billion of cash from operations, we have returned over $840 million to our stockholders in the quarter. We also achieved another quarter of record backlog totaling $137 billion. And based on another strong quarter’s results, we have increased our outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations for the year. We are very pleased with our results as we progress into the second half of 2019.On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the second quarter of this year with last year’s second quarter results. Sales grew 8% compared with the same quarter last year to $14.4 billion while segment operating profit increased 6% over last year’s level to $1.6 billion.On Chart 5, we show the sales growth for second quarter by business areas compared to last year’s second quarter. As shown, all the business areas experienced growth again this quarter. And as Marillyn highlighted, missiles and fire control and space experienced the highest growth in the quarter with 16% and 11% respectively. Both business areas recognized growth in their hypersonic programs. In addition, missiles and fire control sales growth also included volume on classified business and precision fires and space also saw volume increases on next-gen OPIR and GPS government satellite programs. Rotary and mission systems had 6% growth driven by multiple programs that are IWSS line of business but partially offset by Sikorsky primarily due to lower volume. Aeronautics had 4% growth driven by timing on the F-35 program, and I’ll note the F-35 program is tracking ahead of the year-to-date plan. On Chart 6, we compare segment operating profit by business area in second quarter 2019, versus our results in second quarter 2018. Segment operating profit was up again this quarter compared with last year results in each business area. And here, Missiles and Fire Control had the largest increase in operating profit; 17% higher than last year, primarily driven by the volume I just discussed.Space increased operating profit by 5% mainly due to risk retirements on AEHF and volume on government satellite programs. This increase was partially offset by lower ULA equity earnings. ARRW and RMS grew operating profit by 3% and 2% respectively. ARRW was volume driven by both F-35 production and our Skunk Works business.In RMS at higher risk retirements and volume at IWSS, this was partially offset by a charge taken at our training and logistic solutions business.Turning to Chart 7, we’ll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS of $5 was 23% higher than our results last year driven by a few items. First, the quarterly volume drove higher segment operating profit. In addition, it reflects the higher FAS/CAS benefit and lower tax rate, including additional tax deductions for the foreign derived intangible income or FDII that we also experienced in the first quarter of 2019.Turning to Chart 8, we’ll discuss the cash returned to our shareholders in the quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, our free cash flow was approximately $1.4 billion. We returned nearly 60% of our free cash flow to our stockholders in the quarter between dividends and share repurchases.And as I mentioned, we are increasing the full year cash from operations outlook from greater than or equal to $7.5 billion to greater than or equal to $7.6 billion with another quarter of strong performance. We are on track for our continued investment in the business through capital expenditures of $1.7 billion planned for the year, which as usual is proportionately higher in the second half of the year.For the full year, we are progressing toward our cash deployment goals. Chart 9 provides our updated guidance for the year. We are increasing our sales outlook by $1.5 billion based on higher expectations for all our business areas for the rest of the year. This increase in sales was driven by strong backlog across all our businesses. Three of the four business areas had an increase in backlog again this quarter. This outlook takes us to an impressive 10% year-over-year sales growth expectation and as a reminder, our January guidance for the year was 5% sales growth. We are also increasing our segment operating profit outlook by $225 million due to the higher sales volume across all four business areas.And comparable to sales, our segment operating profit outlook is up 9% year-over-year and as a reference point, our January guidance was above 3%. There is no change to our net FAS/CAS adjustment. We are increasing our earnings per share expectations by $0.80. I will provide more detail on this increase on the next chart. And for cash from operations, we are increasing our outlook by another $100 million to greater than or equal to $7.6 billion.Chart 10 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook for the year. The vast majority of the increase is driven by our operational performance and volume. This results in a $0.66 increase in our EPS. The remaining $0.14 improvement in EPS is driven by a lower estimated effective tax rate from approximately 15.5% to 15% for the year. These items result in a total increase of $0.80 and a new EPS outlook of $20.85 to $21.15.On chart 11, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. As I discussed on a prior chart, we increased our sales outlook in all of our business areas. An increase of $65 million at Space, $350 million at RMS, $300 million at Aeronautics and $200 million for missiles and Fire Control, totaling an increase of $1.5 billion above the outlook we provided on our last call.Chart 12 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. Consistent with our sales outlook, each business segment increased their operating profit for the year. Space by $140 million, Missiles and Fire Control by $40 million, $25 million for ARRW and $20 million for RMS, totaling to an increase of $225 million above last quarter’s outlook.And finally on Chart 13 we have our summary. We continued with another quarter in 2019 with strong operational financial performance across our portfolio. We see strength in our backlog for near-term and long-term growth prospects across all of our business areas. And based on the results of the quarter, we increased our full-year outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And with that, we’re ready for your questions. John?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yes. Good morning, Marillyn and Ken.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Peter Arment: So Marillyn, on the F-35 and the impact from Turkey being dropped from the program, you mentioned the production lots 12 to 14 only include roughly 8 units per year. So the questions really are – can those units to be absorbed by other partners in the program? And secondly, removing Turkey from the F-35 supply chain certainly seems more complicated, given the numerous parts that they supply. So, how quickly can those components be produced or transferred to other suppliers and do you anticipate any temporary slowdown on production? Thanks.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question, Peter. I know this is a – a lot of questions around this. But I want to just start by saying that it is a pretty fluid situation, but one in which we’ve been engaged with the Department of Defense for a number of months. Close to a year at looking at challenges you see on this program because there have been indications that there were discussions under way. So it’s clearly a government matter. As I mentioned, we’re going to always follow with the official guidance’s of the US government. And so that’s why we’ve had a lot of discussions with the Department of Defense on that. In terms of your first question about could those eight per year in the next three lots in 12, 13 and 14 by – be absorbed by others? Yes, they could. As you know, there have been additional countries that have expressed interest outside Poland, for example, they just most recently said they’d like to purchase 32 and they are in a process right now of moving through that process for their develop of request an agreement. There are other countries that have clearly indicated that they want more. We mentioned Japan in the past and others. So I don’t see that as a big challenge for us to absorb them. We are – we continue to ramp up production. Related to your question on the supply chain we have been working on this for a number of months, of looking at what could potentially be the impact, making sure that we could mitigate the risk associated with the parts that are produced in Turkey. And so, we have a very good mitigation plan. Discontinuing their participation certainly would impact the supply chain posture across production sustainment to some extent. And so because of that, we’ve been working on it and the F-35 enterprise, the JPO, Lockheed Martin, all of our suppliers are fully confident in the strength and stability of the program and we are working – we’ve been working to wind down the Turkish industry involvement. And so we have a – we have a timeline that we’re working toward. As you’ve heard, it’s out through March of 2020 that we think it will all be resolved. And I think we’re – and because we addressed it, it’s been percolating for a while and we addressed it early, and have been working closely with the Pentagon and even they have requested reprogramming dollars out of Congress to support it. We’re very much comfortable that we’re on a good path to mitigate any risks to the program.
Ken Possenriede: Hey, Peter. This is Ken. The only thing I would say is we have worked very closely with the Joint Program Office, and if there is any harm to industry, we will be compensated for that. So we’re working very closely with them that could – regarding cost schedule or any payment terms, we are – we will be fully compensated for that, which is obviously a good thing.
Operator: Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning, Greg and Ken, roll tide, Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Carter Copeland: Just 30 days to go, you know, so got to get excited. One question, you talked a lot about hypersonics in your prepared remarks, obviously with the proposed M&A activity in the space that’s been more topical and I think there’s been a good bit of disclosure about what programs are out there in recent months. And so, I just wondered you guys have positions on several of these development prototype efforts, but when do you think we see real programs of record? How should we think about the timing and the service leadership around that, what do we think – how are you thinking about that? What’s the future look like from a real sustainable program of record standpoint?
Ken Possenriede: Hey, Carter, it’s Ken. And for the record, I did not go to Alabama. But since my –
Carter Copeland: That’s OK. We like you, we like you all the same.
Ken Possenriede: Since my boss is sitting across the table for me, I’ll say roll tide. So, you know, you’re right. We have done a nice job of working with the customer set, whether it’s the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, DARPA. As Marillyn mentioned, we’ve got $3.5 billion of contracts that are either in our backlog or will soon be in our backlog. It’s – they’re generating sales. They are in – all these programs are in the development, the prototype phase of their program, you’ll start seeing first launch prototype launches starting next year on most of these programs, some of these programs actually have scope that is to prepare for production doesn’t mean they’re going to go into production. But I think once these things are either deemed successful or not in the prototype, the development phase, once we get past first launch, then I think it will be the time for that customer set to sit with us, to see if it makes sense to go into production and that’s probably, say two years out would be our best guess. So you will see this year and next year and into 2021 us continue to perform on these programs from a prototype development standpoint. Perhaps shape a couple of more programs and get a few more in our backlog, but production won’t happen for the next couple of years.
Operator: And next we go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes. Ken, overall can you explain, I mean you raised sales growth by $2.5 billion for the year and a lot of your business is fairly long cycle. I mean there’s some shorter cycle businesses. But can you explain why it would get raised that much or is it just the prior CFO giving a pretty conservative numbers to work with? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: So everybody is on a roll today. Thanks. Thanks, George. You know, actually if you look at our order book, and if you put aside, we assumed we would get the block buy order in the second quarter. Definitization for lot 12 and lot 13, that did not happen. If you put that aside for the year, we’re beating our orders plan by $11 billion and those, some of those are pull ahead. So think of the AWE order that we got, it was for three years. So we’re not getting many sales this year for that order. There are some orders this year that frankly were pull-ins or were orders that we did not expect. There were a few in F-35, we’ve got some follow-on modernization contracts and some sustainment contracts we did not expect. In fact Space is having the strongest year from an order book standpoint, a lot of those are in Mission Systems. There was some Orion work we did not expect, and that is why you’ve seen the increase in guidance for Space being as robust as it is. So roughly, that $1.5 billion, a lot of that is still in front of us in the third and the fourth quarter and a lot of that is for frankly front end orders we got this year. Also remind you that we got the OPIR contract late last year. CSC the Canadian Surface Combatant of RMS and GPS III in late last year. Those programs, especially since Space has talked about – the agency has talked about go fast, we are – we taking them by their word and we are going fast and we’ve accelerated sales. And so a lot of it is order book from late last year and the increase in orders we got in the first half of this year. We’ve done very well there. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. Marillyn, the recently announced plan to merge between Raytheon and United Technologies has brought up a lot of discussion about scale. And I think that kind of sounds to a lot of people, scale sounds like short hand for being bigger in order to absorb more development risk. And I think that’s – that can be a cause of concern for investors since the industry is disciplined over the past ten or 15 years, I think it’s something that investors have applauded and come to appreciate. And so, given that there seems to be more discussion on scale, do you find Lockheed having to rely more on scale as you go out in search of opportunities? And are you seeing others behave any differently?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, it’s great question, Seth. I would just say that, I think for us, our scale is an advantage for us because it gives us the opportunity to invest more in research and development. I think that’s true when you look across our industry, it allows us to reach out to small and medium-sized businesses and to maybe take in fact, we increased our Ventures Fund, so that we could spend more in that arena. We’re looking at – we’ve increased our IRAD expenditure, Independent Research and Development over the last few years. So I think, just by the nature of the size of our Corporation and the financial performance of our Corporation that we’ve been able to invest more in research and development. An example would be, a lot of the wins that we’ve had in hypersonics. I mean, that’s an area we’ve been investing in for a number of years, or directed energy autonomy, a lot of those areas is because we have been able to invest in things that we’re looking at beyond today, not just on what we need to invest to keep our current portfolio relevant. I mean as we look at Raytheon and United Technology’s merger, I mean we’ll continue to monitor that transaction, their progresses and evaluate what that impact might be for Lockheed Martin. But I think we’re very well positioned in, in terms of where we are investing, and I think just seeing our financial performance this year and increasing our outlook in terms of sales for the year and where we’re taking the business, I think that just demonstrates that. So hopefully that answered your question. Anything you want to add, Ken?
Ken Possenriede: The only other thing I’d add Seth is, we do have a very robust, I will call it corporate development process, which includes everything that Marillyn talked about including divestitures and M&A. In fact, we meet with Marillyn, and the head of our corporate strategy lead on a monthly basis to review that and also to review exactly what you just described the – what impact will the scale of UTC have on us, UTC Raytheon have on us, and we’re still sorting that out.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Marillyn, Ken, Greg, good morning, how are you?
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning. Well. Thanks.
Richard Safran: So I was very interested in your opening remarks on the F-35 and pricing and I think it’s been a while since you spoke about the F-35 margins. So I wanted to ask you a couple of things about that. First, and always to the best you can, could you discuss how much of an improvement in margins you’re expecting on LRIP 12 and the new handshake deal that you’re going to finalize? I realize things are still fluid there. Also in your answer, if possible, could you contrast margins on the production program with margins on the sustainment business? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: Good bet Rich and I’ll take that. So you’re right. The ink is not yet dry on, on the Block Buy contract yet, but we’re still going through that and we’re hopeful in the third quarter, we’ll have that lot 12 and 13 definitized. Regarding pricing, we have – we have, I think done a nice job with the joint program office on this contract demonstrating where we think costs are going. We’ve worked very closely with our supply chain in terms of driving down costs and ensuring they still got value from the program from a profitability standpoint. And you’re right it is early, but the deal we think we’ve signed, its two parts of a profit. It’s a base fee, and part of that base fee is a supplier incentive fees that we are going to receive. And that is ensuring that the quality of the work being done and also the price of the work done by our supply chain will if we hit those targets, we will be incentivized for that. The second piece is very similar to Lot 11. We’re going to get a performance incentive fee and that’s based on the final assembly on Lot 12 and then made on Lot 13 and 14 and we feel really good about those targets going forward and we do think if we perform, we have an opportunity to improve margins on Lot 12 through 14, relative to previous lots and part of that is the fee arrangement that we have, that incentivizes us on good performance, plus we’re comfortable with the cost targets that we have for our internal costs and our supply chain. Regarding sustainment and production, we’re seeing production is probably going to be higher in the future compared to sustainment. There would be one thing that could potentially impact that if we can work with the customer to get some type of PBL contract that incentivizes us to reduce cost and availability that, that potentially could help. But just based on the mix of programs on sustainment between cost plus and fixed price compared to production, which is all fixed price, we’ll see higher margins on production going forward.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rajeev Lalwani: Hi, good morning, Marillyn. Good morning, Ken.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Rajeev Lalwani: Marillyn, a question for you. Just coming back to some of your prepared comments around the budget and being able to get a two-year deal. Can you talk about what sort of revenue visibility that gives you and maybe how far out you can now go and then and this part might be for Ken, any implications on the capex side? I mean, having that sort of visibility at this point in time, does that put upward or downward pressure based on everything that you’re seeing today?
Marillyn Hewson: So. Rajeev, I think you know, talking about budgets maybe gives us a better sense of what our customers will have in terms of where they would make their decisions, we’ll have to see how it plays out in terms of what that means for Lockheed Martin. I mean, for the current budget negotiations, it appears that our programs are well supported. But again, we’ll just have to wait until Congress gets through its process and closing on that. So, I can’t really give you a revenue projection around that. The best thing we can do is what we’re giving you in our outlook today and we’re right now in our planning process that we do annually of looking what it’s going to look like in the next coming years. So, we’ll continue to do that. The one thing I would point to for you is the strong backlog, we have. $137 billion backlog gives you, should give you a sense of a very strong performance for us in the next few years. And then, the upside we’ll see as we win more programs and build that backlog is an indication on revenue growth for us. We are very much focused on a strategy of long-term growth and continue to think that not only our portfolio of products we have today are well supported by both the U.S. and our international customers, but beyond that, we’re investing in areas that we think are going to be in demand in the future. So, I feel very good about our growth prospects, but I can’t really make a direct connection between what the budget negotiations are on Capitol Hill versus what our revenue growth is.
Ken Possenriede: Yes, the only thing I’d add on that and then I’ll get to the capital question is, you look at the budgets that are out there and what some of the sound bites are. It does play nicely into our portfolio. So, we do feel good about that and as Marillyn mentioned, we’re excited to start seeing the business areas come in and show us their long-range plan in the next quarter, and we’ll give you some color on that in the October call. Regarding capex, we’ve mentioned, we’ve had we’re stronger than in capital expenditures than we have been historically and we’ll see that for the next couple of years and a lot of that is driven by the recent wins we had in Palmdale. So, we’re building new buildings out in Palmdale for some of the classified wins that we have and I will note that, that big classified job we won last year we did get the second customer order this year, which is great news. So that’s progressing as we like. We talked about Missiles and Fire Control, the ramp on production, that will continue and we’re continuing to see strong demand there. So, there’ll be a strong capital requirement there and at Space, we’re continuing to finish up our gateway program. So, it will be around the $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion of capex probably for the next couple of years. So that’s the best line of sight we have today.
Operator: Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks, good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
David Strauss: I want to ask about the working capital build that you’ve seen year-to-date pretty significant, and based on the free cash flow for current operating cash flow forecast for the full year it doesn’t appear like you’re assuming that any of that kind of comes off through the rest of the year. Can you talk about that? And then also the potential, you know, how you’re thinking about the pension contributions that you’ve talked about in 2021 and potentially pull that forward into 2019? Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: You bet. You’re right. So, we have had some working capital growth in the first half of the year primarily in inventory and in unbilled receivables or contract assets. The thing I would say though is, we have grown the first half of the year very, very strong relative to where we were on December 31st. So, we think we’re doing the working capital build in a smart way. We do see a strong cash generation in the second half of the year and then going into next year, so we do have a concerted effort to reduce our unbilled inventory, reduce the inventory that’s on the balance sheet in the second half of the year and then going into next year. And we’ve always said that would happen to just pick, isolate and pick Sikorsky, we’ll start having those development programs start going into production programs in the next couple of years. So, we will see our working capital come down in a significant way in the next couple of years. Regarding pensions, the best line of sight we have today is, so interest rates are down 75 basis points from where we thought they would be, and we’ve talked about our long-term asset growth of 7%. We are close to 12% year to date. I know the year is not over. So, if you look at those two variables right now, we’ll go through the planning process in the next couple of months, but right now we see a pension contribution of about $500 million next year and then $2 billion in 2021 and probably another $2 billion in 2022. We will go through a financial review later this year and we’ll look at the timing of those pension contributions, whether it makes sense to pull them forward and that will have to be relative to some of the debt obligations that we have in 2020 and 2021. So, we’ll sort that all out in the next couple of months.
Operator: And next we have Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Yes, good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Doug Harned: You know, I wanted to go back to the F-35 and margins, because you made some real progress here with reaching the $80 million target early. If we look forward, when I think of combat aircraft programs like this, you want to be up at that kind of eventually 13% 14% type margin level. So, when you look forward, and this program matures, do you expect it to get up to those kinds of levels, and then, what kind of timeframe is reasonable?
Ken Possenriede: Yes, Doug. So, I gave you color on I gave you color on Lot 12 to 14. So, we’ll hit Milestone C on F-35 soon, and we’ll hopefully start converting these FPI contracts to firm fixed price contracts. And that then will give us the opportunity to recoup more of the underruns than for the contracts we have today. So basically, today the overruns are capped just like a fixed price contract, but we are sharing in the underruns and on a few of these programs we have been fortunate where we have underrun and we’ve been sharing that with the United States government. So, I think it would be going forward, it would be beyond the Block Buy, and it would have to be starting when we start getting into multi-year. So, Lot 15 and beyond would be the opportunity for us to get up in to the to the 13th. And we would do our 13% we would do everything we can to make that happen, and make sure it’s still a fair deal for our customers as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joseph DeNardi: Hi. Good afternoon. Ken, I think, Bruce a couple of years ago talked about kind of the three-year revenue growth goal. And I think that’s obviously changed a little bit. So, can you maybe just revisit just given how strong this year has been, kind of what the framework should be for next year, revenue growth? And then what your ability is in a couple of years to offset some of these pension contributions with better working capital and that type of thing? Thank you.
Ken Possenriede: Thanks, Joe. Yes. So, I we really don’t have a visibility yet into next year, and you’re right we’ve much stronger growth, the good news is backlog is much stronger as well. So, we need to see the timing of that burn down of backlog and we won’t have that visibility for another for another two months and I will, I promise give you that color on the October call. Just going forward, if you look at where we’re going, from a pension standpoint, we do see line of sight out in the 2026 time period where you hopefully you recall we are freezing our pension for the most part, totally by the end of the year and we do see line of sight in ‘20 the end of this year, excuse me, a line of sight in the 2026, 2027 time period where we will be making a modest pension contributions generally for bargaining arrangements that we have. So, it will be out in that time period where we’ll be able to do that. And just to recall, if you look at our CAS recoveries, our CAS recoveries out for the next couple of years are going to be around $2.5 billion and as I mentioned earlier, our pension contributions as we see them today in the 2021, 2022 and 2023 time period are likely to be around $2 billion, but even going farther out as our CAS recoveries go down, they will still be higher than our pension contributions in 2026, 2027 time period.And that should be able to offset working capital to potentially fund the pension plan. So, yes, that potentially could happen.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Yeah, good morning guys.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Pete Skibitski: Just thinking about the continuation of potential continuation of this great growth we’ve been seeing in the last few years guys at Missiles and the Fire control, I think you’re still spending growth capex in Arkansas, you’ve got some of these hypersonic wins and I think that you’ve also got this, I think pretty big competitive take away in AIM-260 program. So, can you talk about the visibility that you do have that Missiles given there are some strategic priority type programs in that segment and offset by maybe some really tough comps? Just maybe talk about some of the visibility you have there. Thanks.
Ken Possenriede: You bet. So, you know, talking to Missiles and Fire Control and they talking to their customer, and I was actually being in the room with them at times. We see strong growth still across their portfolio. So, if you look at Hellfire, I mean you mentioned, Pete, you mentioned you’re spot on, there is still continued capital growth there and it is bought in by the United States government, they understand what we’re doing and fully support it. You will see us in Hellfire go from roughly 8,000 units, up to 11,000 units. We see line of sight of that. GMLRS from 6,000 to 10,000, ATACMS up to 500, JASSM will see significant growth, PAD will continue to see significant growth and I’m sure you saw the big order we got this year from KSA. So, we do see continued demand with THAAD. PAC-3, 350 to 500. In fact, Missiles and Fire Control has heard from their customer set that if we could build 750, they and the international customers would take them. So, we do see very, very strong demand for the next couple of years with Missiles and Fire Control. In fact, they will likely be the fastest growing business area of the Lockheed Martin portfolio for the next couple of years.
Operator: And we’ll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Hi. Good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Ron Epstein: I just wanted to follow up on Sikorsky. Looking at where the business is performing today, how is it performing relative to where you thought it would be when the deal was done?
Ken Possenriede: So, Ron, good morning. So, we’re pleased with how Sikorsky is performing. You have a strong performance with the Black Hawk programs. We just as Marillyn mentioned in her prepared remarks, we got LRIP 2 and 3 with on CH-53K. We’re happy with that performance. We’re trying to shape a deal in India for the MH-60. We have a lot of international demand there. Generally speaking, we’re pleased with the cost take out that we did at Sikorsky, how we integrated them into RMS. Some of the production programs have slipped to the right, understandable, I mean, normal development things that happen, but I’d say on the whole, we’re very pleased with the performances of Sikorsky. We talked about the working capital growth earlier. A lot of that working capital growth is at Sikorsky and it will burn down over the next couple of years. We are trying to shape a couple of new business wins that we feel good about that, the FARA, which is the medium lift helicopter. We feel good about that going forward and then FARA which is the light lift helicopter, we feel good about that. So, on the whole, we’re pleased with where things are going.
Marillyn Hewson: The only thing I would add Ron here is that we there’s been a little bit of a disappointment, but it’s such a small element of the portfolio. It has it’s been offset by all those growth opportunities that you highlighted Ken with the commercial. We have been challenged in our commercial oil and gas area that’s well known it’s, it hasn’t come back and I think that’s true across the industry. But that’s a small element of portfolio, it’s has been very well offset by the growth opportunities we’ve seen on Sikorsky.
Ken Possenriede: And to the point I make there is, and I think we highlighted this Bruce did that, we discounted a lot of that going forward, but you’re right, that would have been nice upside if the market turned.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Rob Spingarn: Hi, good morning.
Ken Possenriede: Good morning.
Rob Spingarn: I wanted Ken, going back to your point on not having line of sight so much into the years, I’m just curious was this higher level of wins in the first half at any level of pull forward of awards you might have expected later this year and next year? Are these mostly market share gains, like example AIM-260 or hypersonics, etcetera, if you could just talk to that a little bit. And then Marillyn if you could speak perhaps to why you are winning some market share there, in especially in the missile side?
Ken Possenriede: You bet, Rob. You know, as I mentioned earlier, we are ahead of our we’re beating, we’re going to beat our plan this year by about $11 billion. You know, I’d say, Rob, it’s probably half pull aheads and half things that we’ve shaped with our customers that were not in our plan.So, you mentioned hypersonics, on the whole, most of those awards were not in our plan, and just to give you a little color, we’re going to probably book about $600 million of sales in hypersonics this year. And then the rest of that $3.5 billion would go into the next two years as I mentioned earlier. AWE, the two additional years would be a pull ahead. The Aeronautics for the most part was, our upside, they were not pull aheads. A lot of the other space programs were upside, so Orion, additional scope is upside. The mission solution’s work is new scope. We had a new order for an international customer for our SOF S-70i program. So, I’d say on the whole, about half pull aheads and half shaping by us to win new programs.
Marillyn Hewson: And then to your question about why, why do you think we’re winning market share? I would just say that we have put innovation and investment in extending our products and investing in new products as the priority in this company. I mean, that’s – we know that, that’s where we bring value to our customers. And so it’s long running investments that we have been making into the programs that are coming to fruition that allows us to win. For example, hypersonics is a great example of that, a lot of the work that we have been doing in that for a number of years. Directed Energy is another example. These are areas that – and even on our current portfolio as we look at extended ranges like PAC-3 MSE or we look at other opportunities that we can do to invest and even in our current portfolio is what allows us. And then I think the key thing is that we have got a very talented team of folks that are always focused on performance and performing on the work we have sets us up well, be able to win new business, because we can invest in affordability, we can invest in innovation to bring that value.
Greg Gardner: Okay. John, this is Greg. I think we have kind of on the top of the hour here. So I will turn it back over to Marillyn for final thoughts.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Greg. So let me just conclude the call today by again reiterating that our second quarter results and our increased 2019 outlook reflect our commitment to our strategy of growth and operational excellence, because we are going to continue to deliver long-term value creation for our stockholders and innovative solutions for our customers. So once again, we thank you for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you on our next earnings call in October. John, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-23 11:00:00) =====

Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in our first quarter 2019 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had exceptionally strong results this quarter, financially, strategically and operationally. These results reflect the quality of our workforce, the strength of the corporation and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and stockholders. My thanks goes to everyone in the company for their contributions in driving this outstanding performance. This performance from across the corporation and expectations for the remainder of 2019 enable us to increase our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operation. Our first quarter results and increased full year outlook reflect the execution of our entire team as each of our 4 business areas were able to contribute to our improved financial outlook. Our backlog grew to a new record level, another sign of the strength provided by our broad portfolio of products and services. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail, but I would like to begin by highlighting a few of the elements that drove our exceptional performance. Sales this quarter exceeded last year's first quarter by 23%, with each business area growing revenue significantly from the first quarter of 2018. The growth was led by Missiles and Fire Control as deliveries of tactical and strike weapons, particularly in our Precision Fires organization, and our PAC-3 missiles grew from last year. Our Aeronautics business area also strong saw strong sales growth as we continue to increase production of our F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and delivered 26 aircraft this quarter compared to 14 in last year's first quarter. Our segment operating profit increased by more than 30% year-over-year as strong performance across the board contributed to the growth. Missiles and Fire Control experienced outstanding operational performance over multiple programs, which allowed them to complete the retirement of risk items planned for later in the year. And similarly, in Space, our government satellites team producing the fifth and sixth spacecraft in the advanced extremely high frequency constellation was able to complete crucial testing milestones ahead of schedule as well as achieve program efficiencies to increase margins this quarter. These strong results in sales and earnings and our focus on maximizing cash returns also allowed us to increase our full year outlook for cash from operations. Our team continues to drive growth and performance in all financial metrics with a portfolio of products, technologies and services that are in great demand by our customers and continue to provide value to our stockholders. I'll touch on some significant performance milestones in just a moment, but I want to first highlight a few of the notable new business items that demonstrate the lasting importance and strength of our deep legacy portfolio. In Aeronautics, our F-16 team received 2 notifications from the State Department of the approvals for F-16 Foreign Military Sales to Morocco. The first is for a potential sale of 25 new F-16 Viper aircraft and related equipment with an estimated value of $3.8 billion. The second State Department approval will allow us to upgrade Morocco's existing 23 F-16 aircraft to the modernized Viper configuration. This opportunity has a total estimated value of nearly $1 billion and once definitized, Morocco will be the fifth international customer to upgrade its legacy F-16 fleet to this enhanced version of the Fighting Falcon. These notifications, coupled with the recent announcements from Bahrain, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Greece, on planned future new F-16 aircraft production and upgrades shows the enduring support of this venerable fourth-generation fighter. In Missiles and Fire Control, we received a contract award for over $1.1 billion from the U.S. Army for lot 14 of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System munitions and associated equipment. Demand for this program has increased significantly, both domestically and internationally, and we now anticipate that we will deliver nearly 5x the number of rockets and launcher pods this year than we did just two years ago. Rotary and Mission Systems saw a continued strong interest from several international customers this quarter. RMS received a $200 million award from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force for development and integration of the Aegis Weapon System on new Japanese ships. RMS has already delivered the Aegis Combat System to 4 of Japan's Kongo-class and 2 of their Atago-class destroyers, and we will now provide this capability for an additional 2 Atago ships, continuing a relationship that began over 30 years ago. RMS' Sikorsky line of business was awarded a contract from Poland to build 4 S-70is, our international BLACK HAWK helicopter variant, for the country's special operations forces missions. The award announced by the nation's prime minister at a signing ceremony inside the Sikorsky production center in southern Poland follows delivery of 2 S-70is to the Polish national police in November of last year and continues our 10 years of Sikorsky helicopter production in Poland. Keeping with Sikorsky, the State Department announced a potential $2.6 billion Foreign Military Sale to India for 24 MH-60R SEAHAWK helicopters. This Romeo version of the BLACK HAWK is the world's most advanced maritime helicopter, and this contract, once definitized, will allow us to deliver unparalleled anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface weapon capabilities to the government of India. And in our Space business area, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense awarded us a contract worth approximately $3.6 billion to oversee the operation of the MOD's atomic weapons establishment sites for another 3 years. We are honored to continue to support the U.K. government's important mission as part of the AWE Management Limited venture with our strong focus on security and safety. These announcements reflect the continued demand both domestically and internationally for our portfolio of products and services. Our legacy platforms remain vibrant, and our focus on innovation and new technologies provides us with growth opportunities for the future. Moving briefly to the defense budget. The president submitted the FY '20 presidential budget in March with a total defense request of $750 billion. Included in this request is $718 billion for DoD total funding, an increase of nearly 5% from the 2019 enacted appropriation level. The FY '20 submission continues to focus on missile defense, nuclear, space, cyber, joint lethality and intelligence capabilities in support of a national defense strategy, and we have demonstrated that our portfolio remains well aligned with these priorities. To achieve the funding objectives contained in the administration's request, Congress will ultimately need to pass legislation to raise the Budget Control Act ceiling, which are still in effect for discretionary defense spending in FY '20 and FY '21. We are encouraged by recent congressional support for raising the spending caps. However, we expect significant discussions to take place before the budget process will be finalized. We have seen strong bipartisan support for national security initiative and the recapitalization of our nation's armed forces over the past several budget cycles as well as for our programs in general, and we are hopeful the fiscal year '20 process results in a similar outcome. Moving on. I would like to highlight several significant events that occurred across the corporation during the past quarter. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program we saw several important milestones and accomplishments take place this quarter that spotlight the program's maturity and the continuing support we see from the international community. First, a truly significant event took place in February as a department of The Navy declared initial operational capability or IOC for its fleet of carrier-variant F-35, deeming the F-35Cs are ready for combat. Beginning with the U.S. Navy's receipt of its first F-35C test aircraft, the joint government and industry team embarked on a rigorous path to IOC, including participation by 2 carrier vessels, 3 squadrons, multiple sea trials and significant logistics and support effort, which resulted in 10 F-35C jets from the Strike Fighter squadron 147, the Argonauts, being declared ready for operations. Preparations can now begin for the first carrier deployment aboard the USS Carl Vinson, and this achievement will mark the first time in over half a century the U.S. Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force will all be mission-ready and combat-capable with the same family of fighter jets, a tremendous achievement for the entire F-35 team. Keeping with the Joint Strike Fighter. I was proud to attend the ceremony this January to celebrate the rollout of the first operational F-35A or conventional takeoff and landing variant for the Royal Netherlands Air Force, becoming the third overall plane to be delivered to the Dutch. The Netherlands has been an F-35 partner since the plane's inception and continues to be a strong advocate for the program. The first 2 CTOL aircraft were delivered in 2013, and we are concurrently supporting operational testing, and this latest addition to the Dutch fleet will ferry to Luke Air Force Base to be used in pilot training. The Netherlands Air Force, with its plan to acquire 37 jets and its role as a sustainment hub in the European region, is a key partner in the F-35 community, and we are honored to help support their national security objectives. Moving to Missiles and Fire Control. We are very pleased to see the first and second tranche of orders from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to procure our Terminal High Altitude Air Defense or THAAD air and missile defense system. In March, we received the initial order for over $900 million for initial tooling and front-end procurement items. And on April 1, just after our quarter closed, we were awarded second order for approximately $2.5 billion to supply interceptors and equipment to support KSA and U.S. government THAAD batteries. These orders are the most recent actions following the U.S., Saudi Arabia announcements in 2017 and support the beginning of the development and deployment of the 7 planned Kingdom of Saudi Arabia THAAD battery installations. In Rotary and Mission Systems, our Sikorsky team celebrated a key milestone with the first flight of the SB>1 DEFIANT helicopter, a revolutionary aircraft developed jointly by our Sikorsky organization and Boeing. The DEFIANT is designed to fly at twice the speed and with twice the range of conventional helicopters, taking advantage of our innovative X2 Technology and coaxial rotor blade design. The SB>1 is currently participating in the U.S. Army's joint multiple role technology demonstrator program, helping to find the requirements for medium-lift utility helicopters for the Army's Future Vertical Lift program. I'll close with our Space business area, which received an order for over $800 million from the U.S. Navy to design, develop, build and integrate technologies to support the flight test demonstration of a new hypersonic boost glide weapon system. Lockheed Martin Space was awarded the Navy's conventional prompt strike weapons contract and will provide flight articles and support equipment for the system's flight test. This order follows 3 previous awards the corporation has received on hypersonic weapons: the Tactical Boost Glide contract, the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon or Hacksaw program and the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon or ARROW program. These wins are being performed in 3 of our 4 business areas with a cumulative value of our hypersonic strike weapon awards now exceeding $2.5 billion across the corporation. Air and missile defense and hypersonic weapons are key priorities of the Department of Defense's national defense strategy and missile defense review, and we look forward to continuing to lead the development of these emerging technologies in support of the customers' missions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.
Kenneth Possenriede: Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales and segment operating profit were both higher than our expectations for the quarter, which also drove additional cash. We returned over $900 million to our stockholders in the quarter, nearly 2/3 through dividends and 1/3 in share repurchases. We also achieved another quarter of record backlog totaling $133.5 billion. And based on the strong first quarter results, we have increased our outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations for the year. We had a tremendous start to the year, and we will discuss these metrics in more depth on the upcoming charts. On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the first quarter of this year with last year's first quarter results. I'll note for comparison purposes that each quarter of this year has 13 weeks in the accounting period while last year's first quarter had 12 weeks. This will reverse itself in the third quarter, which last year had 14 weeks in the accounting period. However, even without the extra week in the first quarter, our results well exceeded our expectations. Sales grew 23% compared with the same quarter last year to $14.3 billion while segment operating profit increased 31% over last year's level to $1.7 billion. On Chart 5, we show the sales growth for first quarter by business area as compared to last year's first quarter. All the business areas experienced double-digit growth. Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control experienced the highest growth in the quarter with 27% and 40%, respectively. Aeronautics sales growth was driven primarily by F-35 production and sustainment volume while Missiles and Fire Control was driven by multiple programs, including precision fires, PAC-3, THAAD and hypersonics. Rotary and Mission Systems had 17% growth with contributions from all lines of business. Space also had strong growth of 13% driven by government satellite programs and new starts, including next-gen OPIR. On Chart 6, we compare segment operating profit by business area in first quarter 2019 versus our results in first quarter 2018. Segment operating profit was up considerably in the quarter compared with last year's results. Here, Missiles and Fire Control had the largest increase in operating profit, 60% higher than last year. This increase reflects volume related to the sales I just discussed and the timing of risk retirements across the tactical and integrated air and missile defense portfolios. Aeronautics grew its operating profit by 23% due to higher volume on F-33 -- F-35 production contracts and risk retirements. RMS grew operating profit by 22% due to higher volume on mission systems at Sikorsky and risk retirements at IWSS, and this was slightly offset by a reserve taken on a ground-based radar program. And Space also increased operating profit by 27% mainly due to risk retirements on AEHF and volume on government satellite programs. Turning to Chart 7. We'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS of $5.99 was 49% higher than our results last year driven by a few items: first, the higher segment operating profit that I just discussed. In addition, it reflects the benefit of a lower tax rate that includes additional tax deductions for the foreign-derived intangible income or FDII that we highlighted as an opportunity in the fourth quarter of 2018. I will talk more about this on a later slide. Lastly, a onetime noncash earnings benefit from a property sales that had previously occurred. Turning to Chart 8. We'll discuss the cash returned to our shareholders in the quarter. Subtracting out our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, our free cash flow was approximately $1.4 billion. We returned nearly 70% of our free cash flow to our stockholders in the quarter between share repurchases and dividends. As I mentioned, we are increasing our full year cash from operations outlook from greater than or equal to $7.4 billion to greater than or equal to $7.5 billion now that we have greater visibility into the year and a quarter of strong performance. We are on track for our continued investment in the business through capital expenditures with $1.7 billion planned for the year, which, as usual, is proportionately higher in the second half of the year. For the full year, we are progressing toward our cash deployment goals. Chart 9 provides our updated guidance for the year. We are increasing our sales outlook by $1 billion based on higher expectations for all of our business areas for the rest of the year. We are increasing our segment operating profit outlook by $100 million due to higher sales volume across all 4 business areas. There is no change to our net FAS/CAS adjustment. We are increasing earnings per share expectations by $0.90. I will provide more detail into this increase on the next chart. And for cash from operations, we are increasing our outlook by $100 million to greater than or equal to $7.5 billion. Chart 10 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook for the year. Our segment operating profit improvement drives a $0.27 increase in our EPS. Updates to our revised estimated effective tax rate from approximately 17.5% to 15.5% for the year, along with miscellaneous items, drive a $0.50 addition in EPS. The property sale from a prior period that we've noted in our press release add $0.13, resulting in a total increase of $0.90 and a new EPS outlook of greater than $20, with a range of $20.05 to $20.35. On Chart 11, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. As I discussed on a prior chart, we increased our sales outlook in all of our business areas: an increase of $425 million in Missiles and Fire Control; $225 million in RMS; $200 million in Aeronautics; and in Space, $150 million, for a total increase of $1 billion above the outlook we provided on our last call. Chart 12 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. And consistent with our sales outlook, each business segment increased their operating profit for the year: Missiles and Fire Control by $40 million, $25 million each for RMS and Space and $10 million for Aeronautics, totaling to an increase of $100 million above last quarter's outlook. And finally, on Chart 13, we have our summary. We're off to a very good start in 2019 with strong financial performance across our portfolio. We continue to see strength in our current level of our backlog as well as our future growth prospects across the entire portfolio. And based on the results of the quarter, we increased our full year outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And with that, we're ready for your questions. John?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. First from the line of Rob Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: Even without the extra week, I think your sales growth was about 14%, the highest in 15 years by our records. And I wanted to drill down a bit, if I could, into MFC, which seems to be the growth leader, and that would -- may have had the easiest comp for the year in this first quarter. I think you're targeting 15% for the year, highest among the segments. So Marillyn, you and Ken called out a bunch of programs that are driving that strength. But there's -- some of these wins are very recent, probably aren't in there yet, like Saudi THAAD, and I think there's a bunch of opportunity coming up with the Army. There's a new PAC-3 interceptor, PrSM, the mobile medium-range missile, among others. How do we think about MFC's growth with all of that opportunity and what you recently won? How long -- how sustainable is this beyond this year?
Kenneth Possenriede: Rob, it's Ken. I'll take that. So interesting question, Rob. And the way I'd answer it is we've talked about our capital expenditures this year of $1.7 billion, which are up quite a bit from previous years, and we see that growth into the future, mainly next year. I'd say a good chunk of that increase is due to our capacity build at Missiles and Fire Control, and that's across the portfolio for the strike weapons business. And the key there is we've worked very closely with our customer set, in line with them when we were building out that capacity. So we see strong growth in Hellfire, in JASSM, in IAMD. And from a PAC-3 standpoint, we see strong growth. You mentioned THAAD Saudi. So you are correct, we just booked that order. So Marillyn mentioned we booked the front-end obsolescence piece of that. In the second quarter, we'll book the interceptors for Saudi plus the Lot 11 interceptors. In the third quarter, we should be booking -- second or third quarter, we should be booking the localization work for Saudi Arabia. And then out in the 2021 time period, we'll book the rest of the interceptors, as Marillyn mentioned, the 7 batteries. So at least in the next couple of years, we see strong growth continuing at Missiles and Fire Control.
Operator: Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Good morning and great quarter. Just to follow up maybe a little bit more on Missiles and Fire Control. We saw the strong profitability in the quarter. And when we look back in the period, kind of 2012, 2013, 2014, kind of seeing upper teens type margin from that business, and I think our understanding was always that the mix toward new programs was going to push that into the 14%, 15% range, more in accordance with your guide this year. But maybe if you could talk about the sustainability of the Q1 profitability and why we shouldn't think that, that margin is going to be significantly higher going forward.
Kenneth Possenriede: Seth, it's Ken. I'll take that. So if you look at the first quarter, we had a couple of things going. So we did have a lion's share of our profit step-ups, risk retirements occurring in the first quarter. But what also happened in the quarter, we looked at some of our risk retirements that were planned later in the year, and it actually did make sense for us to take those steps in the first quarter. So if you look across the portfolio, it's apparent to us -- based on the first quarter results, we did take our outlook up from a profit standpoint for PAC-3 and THAAD, and that is mainly driven by performance and volume. And looking at our tactical and strike missiles portfolio, some of that growth was for performance and volume, but some of it was mainly for volume. So if you think about some of the starts -- the new starts in that part of the portfolio, namely hypersonics, that is going to continue to grow over time. That will be dilutive to margins. And also, the classified program that we talked about in the past, we're starting to see some volume growth there, but that will be dilutive in the future. So we see for the rest of the year with Missiles and Fire Control being a little north of 13% margin, so not what we saw in the first quarter for the reasons I described.
Operator: And we'll go to Rich Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran: Ken, I guess I would just like to follow up on those comments that you just made about margins and the bit of dilution I think you're seeing from the influx of new development programs. Now you did mention that it was going to be dilutive going forward, but I'm also wondering though if that's pointing to future growth and margin expansion. And are there other elements -- everybody looks at margins as sort of a surrogate for cash. Are there other elements of cash that gives you confidence going forward? And as always, if you're seeing this growth in -- with new programs, I'm wondering what that might imply for your long-term cash flow outlook.
Kenneth Possenriede: Thanks, Rich. Yes. So we have had a concerted effort on our working capital. And you did see some of the benefits of that this year, so we feel good about what we're doing to manage the balance sheet from a working capital standpoint. So we still feel good about where we're going in the future for next year and the year after, at, round numbers, about $7 billion each in 2020 and 2021. We're also working the international angle, and we should see some potential advanced payments in the future. And we do see some upside from a margin standpoint going forward.
Marillyn Hewson: Just to add to that, too, Ken. I mean as we see these development programs, as they go through their longer cycle and get into production, we'll see margin improvements.
Kenneth Possenriede: We'll see margin expansion as well. Thank you, Marillyn. Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald Epstein: Marillyn, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about hypersonics and what is going on there for the company. I understand a lot of that is classified so you're limited in what you can say, but can you give us a broader feel about how that market's developing? And maybe more color on how it's developing for Lockheed.
Marillyn Hewson: Sure. Thanks for the question, Ron. I guess the first thing I would say is that we've been investing in hypersonics for many, many years. And as a result of that, I think that's why we're leading in this front end of being able to bring capability forward. In terms of how the market is developing, it's basically threat-driven. If you look at what was in the national defense strategy, what's in the missile defense review, what you're seeing, our near-peer competition with China and Russia, I mean it's clearly a growing need for us to be able to not only address hypersonics but counter hypersonics as well. And so we are investing in both of those areas. We're bringing capabilities forward in both of those areas. And as I expressed in my earlier remarks, it's across 3 of our 4 business areas. Of course, the fourth business area will be working on some of the communications elements of that as well. And so frankly, it's an important investment area for us for many years as a corporation. And as we collaborate across our business areas and across our corporation, I think we're bringing the best solutions forward to our customer.
Operator: And next, we go to Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: I wanted to switch over to F-35. You're seeing good growth there, but when you look at where the 2020 budget is, it cuts numbers back to 78. But then on the other hand, you've got a letter from 103 house members wanting to raise that to 102. And then we've got the issues around the Turkey order and then maybe some risks around Italy and Canada. So what I'm trying to understand is when you look at the plan that you have for taking production rates up over the next few years, how important are these potential shifts up and down. How do you think through where this could end up on the high end or on the lower end when you plan?
Marillyn Hewson: So let me just start with that, and then, Ken, you can add on to my comments. I guess the first thing I would say, Doug, is that we are continuing to see increased opportunities for the F-35. There's strong international demand. Certainly, as the domestic demand with the U.S. services is strong, the Department of Defense has been very clear that they're going to stay on their full procurement plan for that jet. They don't have any intention to pull away from that at all, so we see that going forward. How they manage what they buy year-to-year, that's always been a challenge as they look at what their overall needs are relative to the budgets that they have to work with. So I think that's going to continue, but what we're really seeing is the list of interested countries is continuing to grow. And you probably heard the Admiral Winter who is the Program Executive Officer recently comment a couple of weeks ago, he mentioned Poland and Romania, which are among the others that we’re well aware of having competitions and having expressed their interest in the program going forward. So it's -- there's continued interest. Even the existing partners are expanding their needs, say Japan, for example. We're seeing a lot of other countries continue. So it is a -- it's certainly an opportunity for us to address the growing demand. We frankly have great capacity on this program. We've got facilities that -- in place that we're going to be in position to produce over 180 aircraft a year. We're prepared to do that. And so we see a lot of opportunities beyond the current program of record, which is something like 3,300 aircraft already, and it's growing. So I don't see a concern about that. Well, certainly, the government -- the JPO will have to figure out what -- how they manage what aircraft they buy at what point in time as countries look at their procurement decisions or as things change amongst some of the partners that we have. But I think they're managing that risk quite well and the demand is very strong. Want to add to that, Ken?
Kenneth Possenriede: Yes. The only thing I'd say and it's just -- if you think about the countries you describe, Doug. Turkey, an important ally of ours at least today, is -- if I remember this right, in the block buy, it's 8 aircraft per lot. Right now, Canada is not even in those numbers. Italy is an important ally. We're hopeful that they do continue on the program, but in the grand scheme of things, not a material number of aircraft. I think the frustrating piece for us is the United States Air Force. And we'll continue working with our customer and with representatives in the government on what's the right path forward there, and we'll continue to drive the price of the airplane down. We see a path too on LRIP 14, which is -- will be ordered in 2020 and delivered in 2022, will be below $80 million an aircraft for the A variant. And we'll continue driving down sustainability cost to where we get to $15,000 a flight hour by 2025. We're confident about hitting those numbers.
Marillyn Hewson: I think it's $25,000.
Kenneth Possenriede: Sorry, $25,000, excuse me, by 2025.
Operator: And next, we go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Ken, on the F-35, you clearly raised the margin on that program. Can you tell us where -- which block and where we might be on that? And then on the $50 million charge of the ground-based radar that you alluded to, what was that? And have there been other charges on that program in the past?
Kenneth Possenriede: You bet. Yes, George, you're right. On F-35, we did raise margins. It was mainly on looking at LRIP 10, looking at block buy and on some of our sustainment programs. And going forward, we're looking at steps on some of our other production programs, including LRIP 11, and we'll see how we're doing from a performance standpoint. So you've got that right from an F-35 perspective. So on the radar program, that is out of our RMS business, and we've had some issues from a software verification standpoint and fixes, installation and checkout and integration and test efforts. No, this was not our first write-off on this program. Going forward though, we feel pretty good. And if you look at some of the things that we have to do, for the rest of this year, we'll be doing software verification. Integration and test completion will be done. We'll deliver a secondary array later this year, and that will ultimately get us to delivering our radar -- the radar by the end of 2020. So going forward, we feel good about where we are on this program.
Operator: Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr: So DoD is increasingly using classified orders to buy equipment to enhance security. Can you give us a rough sense in terms of what percent of your revenues or your backlog is classified? And maybe any color you might be willing to offer regarding in what areas of your business do you have more classified programs?
Kenneth Possenriede: Cai, it's Ken. It will be hard for us to tell you how much of that's in our backlog. But you should think of -- based on who we are, it's across our portfolio. We have a strong presence in Space. We have a strong presence in Missiles and Fire Control. It goes without saying, ADP, our Skunk Works has a strong presence doing classified work. And frankly, it's growing, and it's an important piece of our portfolio.
Operator: Next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.
Rajeev Lalwani: Ken, I wanted to just come back to the guide and the performance in 1Q. Obviously, a good start to the year. It seems like you're highlighting a good portion of the strength to be timing-related. Can you just talk a bit more about why that is? I mean it seems like you're maybe expecting just a lot lower growth in the back half of the year. Are you being conservative? Are you concerned about budget? Just some more color there to get comfortable with the path ahead.
Kenneth Possenriede: You bet. So yes, if you go around the business, and I'll talk to this as our surprise and not so much year-over-year, but looking at ARROW, strong performance mainly in F-35. And looking at the back half of the year, it warranted taking our guidance up mainly -- in Aeronautics mainly driven by F-35. But also, back to Cai's question, some of that growth we did see in ADP, in our classified growth, which is dilutive. So that's why we only took our profit up the $10 million, and we took our sales up to $100 million. What I would say is, just recently coming from Aeronautics and looking at F-35, on the whole, we have comfort about the guidance that we're providing on F-35 right now. There may be potentially some upside. We'll see that in the next couple of quarters, but right now, we feel pretty good about Aeronautics. I think I gave enough color on Missiles and Fire Control, and we do see strong growth there. But in the back half of the year, it is lower, and we'll address that as time goes on. From an RMS perspective, from a guidance standpoint, we did take our guidance up driven by -- mainly driven by radar programs. In some -- to some extent, Sikorsky, we are seeing stronger growth at Sikorsky. But I will note just based on helicopter deliveries this year on the BLACK HAWK and frankly, there are none for MH-60 this year or CH-53 this year, year-over-year, Sikorsky is still down in sales. And from a Space standpoint, beginning of the year, we saw them as flattish. We now see them growing roughly 2%, and that's in the new start for OPIR, GPS III and space missile defense. But as you said, more of it in the front end than in the back end, and we'll take a look at this again in the second quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS Securities.
Myles Walton: In the back of the press release, from the risk section, I noticed you expanded the commentary around delays due to governmental policy, in particular congressional notification delays to Saudi and UAE for the first time. It's obviously not holding you back. Your sales and bookings look great. But I'm just curious, is that -- are you seeing it? Or are you anticipating it? And is it both for military sales as well as through a commercial sales process?
Kenneth Possenriede: Myles, I'll take that. It's Ken. So we're not seeing it today, so it probably would be more in the future. So pick C-130Js for Saudi Arabia. We've been in conversations with the Kingdom, frankly, probably over the last 2 years. They have a desire to buy 23 variants of the C-130J aircraft. It still has not been approved by the United States government, so we're still sorting that -- excuse me, it has been approved by the United States government, but we're still sorting out when that can happen. So I think it's more anticipatory than what we have seen in the past.
Marillyn Hewson: If I could just add on to that. I mean we did get congressional notification get through that some years ago. But to Ken's point, it's been a number of years ago, and they've only bought 2 of the 25 they were authorized for. So we're in discussions with them. But if you think about some of the risk of sanctions against some of the munitions or something along that line, I mean, we conform with the policies of the U.S. government. So any changes in quantity that they might purchase will line up with U.S. policy. But as Ken said, we currently have orders on the books, and we're looking to fill those orders, and we don't see any changes to that guidance right now. So it's just acknowledging to a stockholder that there is risk, but we're not seeing that risk materialize yet.
Operator: Next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: On the F-35, you mentioned how the aftermarket had contributed in the first quarter. I was wondering what your expectation might be for F-35 support revenues this year and what that program could grow to over time.
Kenneth Possenriede: Sure. Rob, it's Ken. I'll take that. So yes, we do see sustainments going to grow this year, and it'll grow double digits. I don't think there's any question about that. And I do believe, based on conversations with the customer, we will continue to see growth in our sustainment. We'll continue to stand up basis in order to support the needs of having available aircraft out there. You'll see spares and parts continue to grow. We've talked a lot about the modernization of F-35 program, so you'll start seeing aircraft that are in the field, that are deployed out in the field will start to be modernized. So yes, in the foreseeable future, we continue to see growth in the sustainment of the F-35 program from a sales standpoint.
Operator: And we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Just broader picture, going back to the growth question, the expectation of 6% -- 6% to 8% top line growth for the year. You're still growing at impressive mid-teens rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter. How do we think about the multiyear outlook in terms of growth? And maybe what's changed? Are there any new program wins? Any international wins? Or is it a delta versus what you're seeing in outlays on the budget?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, Sheila, thank you for the question. Let me just start by outlining for you the key areas of growth that we see, and then Ken can give some more color to that. I mean, first of all, I already mentioned earlier about the growth on the F-35. We consider that as a true growth engine for us for the next -- for the foreseeable future. And in fact, if we just look at the international growth opportunities, half -- close to half of the orders over the next for 5 years are going to be in international marketplace. And as I mentioned, there are several more countries that are coming online that we didn't anticipate even when we looked at that a year ago. Air missile defense is a key growth core area for us with PAC-3, THAAD, with our Aegis Combat Systems, with what we're doing with MEADS in Germany on what's called TLVS. But that area is a growth for us. Sikorsky, we continue to see growth in the Sikorsky line of business. We've got a lot of development programs, of course, that we are working on, from the CH-53K to the combat rescue helicopter, to the presidential helicopter, to also the opportunity on Future Vertical Lift. So that's a big opportunity for us. There's resurgence in our F-16. We're not only selling new F-16s, we're upgrading F-16s, and we see more and more customers coming forward to purchase F-16s. And then there's a big potential opportunity in India. So as we look forward, there could be up to anywhere close to 400 opportunities on F-16s between those -- among those countries that we see today. So good growth there. And then, of course, we want to continue with our growth on C-130, so the multiyear C-130 as well as opportunities in the Middle East and other countries for the C-130. Our Space business and the areas of space situational awareness and areas like that, we'll continue to see growth and then our radar systems, a lot of our sensors and opportunities. And then Ken had gone a great length talking to you a little bit about what we're doing in the Missiles and Fire Control. The real key is, if you look at our backlog, a record backlog of over $130 billion. I mean that sets us up well -- just that alone, what we've already booked in the business sets us up very well for the next few years. And then it should give you great confidence in that growth for that and then the opportunities we're seeing that aren't even yet in that backlog. Ken?
Kenneth Possenriede: You hit every point I was going to make, so thank you.
Operator: Next, we go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: I'm going to follow on that because the bookings and the revenue projections both from you and the consensus don't -- are pretty far from squaring up. So 2017 book-to-bill, 1.2; 2018, 1.45; the quarter, 1.2. I think you've said the second quarter of this year would be your strongest of the year. I think you've said a lot of the 2018 booking strength isn't actually falling in 2019, and the bookings are very predictive of the revenue historically in the business. Why -- what am I missing in not believing the guidance that has the top line organic revenue growth rate decelerating to 5% to 6% the rest of the year; the consensus 2020/2021, 5% to 6%? Why shouldn't it look a lot more like the first quarter, obviously ex the week, but in the double digits, which looks a lot more like the booking strength has been for a while here?
Kenneth Possenriede: Yes. No. It's Ken. I'll take that. So if you go back to last year, so our bookings last year were almost $79 billion. Think about the block buy of $23 billion of bookings last year, the omnibus work that we got for 36 aircraft, the economic order quantity bookings we got. So they're all -- that's great they're all in backlog. The issue is from a capacity standpoint, from where we are with the F-35, a lot of those orders were not just LRIP 12, but for LRIP 13 and 14 and then the front end of procurement for those orders. And it's going to take us a while to have that convert to cost and to sales. And the same thing -- for the second quarter, we're going to hopefully get the block buy definitization in the second quarter, which will be a sizable order in this quarter. But from a sales standpoint, that's not going to happen for the next couple of years.
Marillyn Hewson: And as we highlighted in my remarks, Ken, just to add to that, we did book the 3-year award on AWE, which typically, in the past, we haven't been doing those at a 3-year tranche. So that was a good solid unexpected award to get 3 years under our belt in the first quarter as well.
Kenneth Possenriede: Right.
Operator: Next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay: I'd like to discuss the Orion program for a minute. It feels like this human space exploration initiative has had a lot of starts and stops over the last 15 years or so. And you guys have noticed some top line strength there now for two quarters in a row. The question is what is the proving point on this program where it kind of becomes too hard to cancel ahead of the next period of budget pressure?
Marillyn Hewson: I'll give you a top-level story on that and then let -- Ken, if you have some additional to add to it. But I mean, if you look at the focus that this administration has on being leading in space, it has become a much more -- not only the exploration side, which is what Orion is focused on, but from a contested domain in terms of challenges that we see from our adversaries in space, over 70 countries have things up there in space. We've got space pads. We've got all of the satellites on the national security side that we're doing, the weather satellites. We have a range of capability across our Space business. Then when you look at the exploration side, there is a big desire for us to get to the moon and beyond. And Orion is the next spacecraft that will take astronauts to the moon and beyond -- to Mars and beyond. I mean that's our -- that's what we've been investing in, what the U.S. government's been investing in. It's held up well budget after budget because there's a strong bipartisan support for investing in that exploration opportunity. And couple that with a lot that you have heard from the administration and from NASA on where we want to go in space exploration, there's strong momentum behind it. So I think that's going to continue.
Kenneth Possenriede: Yes. I think the only other thing I'd add is just think where Orion is from an exploratory mission 1 and 2. If you look at exploratory mission 1, the crew module's complete. They're moving into testing. They're going to make the crew and the service modules soon. They're going to -- in the summer, that's going to get transported to NASA's Plum Brook Station, which is in Ohio for integrated environmental testing, and the launch on the SLS is driven for 2020. And EM-2, the exploratory mission two is right behind it in 2022. So there is enough momentum on this program that it's alive and well and well thought of.
Operator: Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: Marillyn and Ken, sort of bigger-picture question here in terms of execution and investing. Clearly, there's big growth and a lot of opportunities to come. So sort of part A is how are you executing on this big growth and aligning incentives just as you encounter some charges here and there? And then also, how are you investing at the opportunities? Specifically, how do you choose between what opportunities you pursue and which opportunities you do not pursue?
Marillyn Hewson: That's a great question, Jon, and it is a focus that we always have on performance and execution as a company. And I would say, just looking holistically, we're performing extremely well. I mean we do track very closely our performance in support of our customers on our programs on a regular basis, and we set a high bar obviously, even tighter requirements on our cost, schedule, quality, technical performance than even our customers do so that we get early warnings if things are going on track or whatever. And so we're performing well. We also keep a very strong focus on our suppliers because our suppliers play a key role in our overall performance. Somewhere between 60% to 70% of our revenue is in the supply base, so we rely heavily on those enterprises to perform in what they're doing as well. And we've got a strong subcontract management team that is working closely with them to make sure that they meet their commitments on performance so that we likewise will meet our commitment. Now on occasion, yes, we do have issues. When you're in a business like ours where you've got a portfolio of programs that are well into production, performing well, but you have new starts, very complex high-technology work that we do as a technology company start-up, there are times where we will have challenges not just in the development and complexity of the product but also in the supply base in support of that. We work through those. We put -- we have well-oiled processes in our company with program-assist teams and others that go in and work very closely at the front end of programs to address that. In terms of alignment of incentives, I mean, absolutely, our performance is aligned -- our performance is key to us performing and achieving incentives for our teams. So I think all of that is well lined up. It's long-standing processes that we have in the company. I think that's why you see that -- across the board that we performed well as a company, and we meet our commitments. Again, we're not perfect. We have issues that arise. But when there are issues, we address them, we put the right resources around it to go address them, and we never walk away from our customer on issues when we have them. The second point on investing, we do look where our priorities ought to be, and it comes with first aligning with the priorities of our customers. So we are constantly working closely with understanding where they're focused. If it's -- whether it's hypersonics, directed energy, whether it's what they need in advanced aircraft where they're looking at sensors and, as I mentioned, the space domain, all of those areas, we are in constant contact with our customers, understanding their priorities and aligning with our priorities. And if you look at our portfolio, how well it's been supported in the Department of Defense budget, in the government budgets that we have in the U.S. as well as our growth in our international marketplace of how we performed well in the international market with somewhere around 28% to 29% of our revenue is outside of the U.S. and then the absolute value of that is growing, I think we're well aligned in investing on the right things so that we can bring our best solutions to our customers.
Greg Gardner: John, this is Greg. I think we've come about the top of the hour here. So I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for final thoughts.
Marillyn Hewson: Well, thank you, Greg. And let me just conclude the call today at the same place that I began the call, and that is by thanking the employees of Lockheed Martin for their contributions and dedication. The company has performed with excellence, and we continue to be well positioned to deliver growth and long-term value to our customers and our shareholders. So thank you again to all of you that joined us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you at our next earnings call in July. John, that concludes our call for today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-29 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference now to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ken Possenriede, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Elect. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements, and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. I hope everyone has had a good start to the New Year. As you heard Greg mention, we are joined today by Ken Possenriede, our CFO Elect, who will take over for Bruce after we file our 10-K in February, as Bruce has announced that he is retiring later this year. Ken and I worked together quite a bit over the years and I'm very excited that he will join our Executive Leadership Team as CFO. I'll have a few more thoughts to add about both Bruce and Ken after our Q&A portion of the call. But for now, welcome Ken.
Kenneth Possenriede: Thank you, Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: I'll begin by thanking our entire Lockheed Martin team for an impressive year and express my gratitude for their outstanding contribution throughout 2018. It was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to deliver results, which not only exceeded many of our expectations but also set records across a number of our financial metrics. Notably, all four of our business areas grew sales, earnings and backlog during the year. Our strong performance was broad-based and a reflection of the continuing demand for our wide range of products. I'll touch on some of the performance highlights in just a moment, including some important F-35 international activities, but I want to first discuss a few of the notable new business successes that contributed to our fourth quarter orders and showed the strength of our broad portfolio. Aeronautics received the largest single order of the quarter and the year with the announcement of our F-35 production lots 12, 13 and 14 economic order quantity, or EOQ, award at an incremental value of approximately $19 billion, adding over 250 aircrafts to our backlog. Our F-35 aircraft backlog has grown to nearly 400 planes, a level which exceeds the total of 35 deliveries we've made to-date, a clear sign of the program's momentum. We continue to work with the F-35 joint program office to finalize the full order of lots 12, 13 and 14, which once completed will represent a total of 478 aircraft. International community expressed their continued interest in our legacy F-16 fighter program for both upgrades and new production units of our Viper Aircraft configuration. Our aero team closed on an opportunity with Greece to modernize 85 of their current F-16 fleet to this advanced platform, continuing the partnership with the Greek military that has spanned more than 70 years. The Bulgarian Ministry of Defense announced their intent to procure eight new jets. Once the contract is finalized and definitized, Bulgaria will join Bahrain and Slovakia as new F-16 customers, extending our backlog of Fighting Falcons well into the mid-2020s. Our Missiles and Fire Control team secured a PAC-3 Award to deliver over 450 interceptors, launcher modification kits and associated equipment to the U.S. Army and foreign military sales customers. To-date, 13 nations have chosen PAC-3 products to provide missile defense capabilities for their citizens and we continue to expand our manufacturing facilities to satisfy the growing requirement. Also this quarter, Rotary and Mission Systems won a competitive award from the Missile Defense Agency to design and develop a second homeland defense radar system and provide installation services for our solution in Hawaii. This $585 million contract is part of the U.S. Military's ballistic missile defense system and will provide improved tracking and discrimination technologies to counter evolving ballistic missile threats. This strategic win leverages capabilities developed on our long-range discrimination radar contract and provides the lowest risk solution to identify and warn of long-range ballistic missile threats during mid-course flight. These announcements reflect the strength of our legacy programs as well as our commitment to innovation that has resulted in new strategic long-term growth opportunities. I'm very proud of our Lockheed Martin team and the passions with which we pursue new business solution to support our customers' missions. Moving briefly to the federal budget environment, the Department of Defense is operating under the 2019 fiscal year Appropriations Act that became law last year. The Appropriations Act fully funded the Defense Department, providing approximately $617 billion of base budget funding for the nation's security and defense programs. The legislation aligned with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which provided additional funding for national defense and raises the budget caps for fiscal 2019. We will wait the release of the FY20 Presidential Budget submission in the coming weeks. We believe it will align with the National Defense strategy's focus on missile defense, nuclear, space, cyber, joint lethality and intelligence capabilities. We anticipate that the budget input will reflect these priorities and we believe our portfolio is well aligned with this strategy. We are hopeful that fiscal year 2020 funding will be in line with, or better than, prior Presidential Budget request and that it will continue to emphasize recapitalization of our nation's defense assets and the research and development that is critical to maintain our country's future security. Several days ago, an agreement was reached to temporarily open, through February 15th, the federal agencies that were affected by the recent partial shutdown of the government. The previous closure of these agencies did not have a significant impact on this year's anticipated financial metrics, as a vast majority of our business is currently funded through the DOD's FY19 Appropriations Bill. Should the budget impasse recur after the three-week continuing resolution expires, it is possible we could see some delays in 2019 Awards and Orders. As government leaders negotiate a new spending agreement, we continue to advocate for stable and consistent budgeting that enables U.S. government agencies and the industry to plan, invest and execute with confidence. Moving on, I'd like to highlight several significant events that occurred across the corporation during the past quarter. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program, we saw several accomplishments and important milestones take place this quarter that spotlight the program's mature production and base deployment activities, as well as the continuing demand we see from the international community. First, we delivered our 91st F-35 aircraft of the year on December 20th, meeting our 2018 target and exceeding our 2017 deliveries by 25 jets, an increase of nearly 40%. Notably, of the 91 airplanes delivered last year, 37 were for international partners and foreign military sales customers, evidence of the growing global interest in this fifth-generation fighter. In October, we were very pleased to learn that the Belgian Ministry of Defense selected the F-35 aircraft for its future fighter acquisition program. With this selection, Belgium becomes the 13th nation to join the F-35 program of record with the plan to buy of 34 conventional takeoff and landing or CTOL models. Lockheed Martin is honored by the Belgian government's selection of the F-35 for their future national security needs, building on our long-running strategic partnership with the Belgian Air Force and their legacy fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons. We look forward to continuing this relationship and helping to provide long-term capability for the Belgian Military. In addition, Japan's National Security Council and Cabinet signaled continued support for the F-35, authorizing acquisition of 105 additional jets, adding to the 42 aircraft already approved. The Japanese F-35 plan includes, for the first time, acquisition of 42 short takeoff and vertical landing or STOVL variants. And the 147 total aircraft procurement will make Japan the largest international customer for this unrivaled fifth-generation fighter. And just a week ago, the Republic of Singapore's Defense Minister announced the selection of F-35 as the aircraft most suitable to be their country's next-generation fighter. Singapore will initiate the process to procure a small number of jets to fully evaluate the capabilities of the plane, after which we will follow a decision as to the best approach to replace their legacy F-16 fleet. We are honored to be selected at this time and look forward to supporting the Republic of Singapore Air Force during this process. Some of our original F-35 partners also celebrated key milestones this quarter. Australia welcomed the arrival of its first two F-35 conventional takeoff and landing aircraft at Royal Australian Air Force Base, Williamtown, the site of Australia's first operational squadron. Australia becomes the seventh nation with F-35 aircraft based on their home soil, ushering in a new era for their nation's defensive capabilities. And both Italy and the United Kingdom have now declared their respective fleets of F-35 combat-ready with the Italian Air Force declaring initial operational capability for their squadron of CTOL variants in late-November and the UK declaring IOC for their STOVL variants earlier this month. With these announcements, we have now seen four countries declaring F-35-ready for frontline operations, demonstrating the maturity and momentum of the Joint Strike Fighter program. In Missiles and Fire Control, our tactical and strike missile team delivered their first long-range anti-ship missiles called LRASM, precision-guided missile to U.S. operational units, thereby achieving early operational capability status ahead of the programs scheduled. This milestone follows an intense integration and test phase, which culminated in the airlines for LRASM variant successfully completing multiple tests from the U.S. Air Force B-1 Lancer Bomber, demonstrating our ability to rapidly deliver crucial capabilities to our war fighters. The LRASM program represents a long-term strategic opportunity and we are excited to have begun the journey with our first delivery. In our Rotary and Mission Systems business area, we were very pleased to be selected by the Royal Canadian Navy as a member of Canada's combat ship team to be their preferred bidder to begin design work for the future fleet of Canadian Service Combatant ships. Lockheed Martin Canada will be the combat systems integrator and provide the combat management system we originally developed for the Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax-class ships, providing important technology to help deliver a bow-to-stern, digitally-designed warship. A total of 15 ships are planned to be built to replace Canada's Iroquois-class destroyer and Halifax-class frigates and will form the backbone of Canada's maritime combat power for decades to come. The Canadian Service Combatant Program is the largest defense project ever undertaken by the government of Canada. And when completed, the RMS team could see orders totaling approximately $7 billion for their role in this effort. I'll close with our Space business area and a truly historic event. The NASA InSight Mars Lander designed and built by Lockheed Martin's Space engineers, made a dramatic entry and descend through the Martian atmosphere and successfully touched down on the surface of the red planet. Over the course of 6.5 minutes, the InSight Lander went from a speed of 12,300 miles per hour to a gentle landing in the Equatorial region of Mars. The robotic explorer has now begun its task of studying the interior of the planet; its crust, mantle and core with a goal of better understanding the geologic evolution of Mars, as well as other terrestrial planets. The InSight Mars Lander is the latest in the long Lockheed Martin heritage of participating in NASA and Mars programs dating back to 1976 in the Viking mission, and we are honored to have played a significant role in this and all 10 preceding NASA missions to Mars. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks Marillyn; and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Both our sales and segment operating profit continued to exceed our expectations, as we close out the year. Sales were $53.8 billion for the year, while segment operating profit was nearly $5.9 billion, about $800 million and $100 million higher, respectively, than when we spoke in October and this helped drive earnings per share to $17.59, also above over last outlook. We generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations, after contributing $5 billion in pension contributions. Operating cash flow was slightly below our expectation, as a number of invoices were not paid until the beginning of 2019, taking longer to pay than our history would've led us to expect. As a result of this carryover and continued strong cash performance, we have increased our cash guidance for 2019 above the outlook we provided in October and will discuss this in more detail in later charts. We've returned $3.8 billion of cash to our stockholders, $2.3 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases. Our repurchase amount was higher than planned for the year, as we opportunistically increased our buybacks in the fourth quarter as overall equity markets declined, so we could capitalize on the reduced share price of Lockheed Martin as we closed out the year. And, finally, but perhaps most importantly, we achieved a record level for backlog at year-end, finishing at over $130 billion. So we had a very strong finish to the year and we're well positioned to carry that momentum into 2019. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in 2018 with our performance in 2017. Sales grew 8% for the year, while segment operating profit grew by 15% for the year, both finishing at record levels and all four business areas grew in both metrics as we'll show in the next couple of charts. On Chart 5, we show the sales growth for the year by business area. Missiles and Fire Control had the strongest growth in 2018 at 16%, driven by continued tactical and strike missile growth along with increases in the Air Missile Defense portfolio. Aeronautics grew by 9% for the year with F-35 providing most of that growth, while the Skunk Works and F-16 program also contributed to the increase, more than offsetting reductions in the C-5 program as we completed the RERP program in 2018. Both RMS and Space had low single-digit increases in sales for the year with the RMS growth driven by the integrated warfare systems and sensors line of business, while the Space growth came from a strategic and missile defense line of business. On Chart 6, we compare segment operating profit by business area in 2018 versus our results in 2017. Here, RMS had the largest increase in operating profit, 44% higher than last year. This increase was due to improved performance across the Sikorsky portfolio, as well as the absence of a charge taken last year on the EADGE-T program. Missiles and Fire Control grew operating profit by 21%, due to improved performance in tactical and strike missiles and a number of sensor programs. Space increased operating profit by 8%, due to improved performance in both the commercial and government satellite lines of business, and Aero grew its operating profit by low-single digits due to higher volume and improves performance on both F-35 production and sustainment contracts. If you'll turn to Chart 7, we'll discuss the significant increase in earnings per share this year compared with last year. We ended the year with EPS of $17.59, an increase of roughly 33% over our 2017 EPS after adding back $6.77 worth of net tax reform changes that negatively impacted last year's results. Our results for the year included a negative impact of a non-cash impairment and the international joint venture investment that reduced EPS by $0.29. The overall increase this year was driven by higher segment operating profit and a lower effective tax rate. Chart 8 shows the increase in backlog over last year's amount to a - the record level of $130 billion. Backlog grew nearly 25%, driven by a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5 for the year with Aeronautics setting the larger increase but all four business areas grew backlog in the year. Chart 9 provides our outlook for the expected performance and key financial metrics in 2019. Our sales guidance of $55.75 billion to $57.25 billion is higher at the midpoint than the high-end of the range we provided during the October call and implies 5% growth over our 2018 results. Segment operating profit at the midpoint also implies a margin at the high-end of the range that we gave in October. Our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $1.475 billion is $25 million lower than we estimated last quarter and we'll discuss the drivers of the change in a couple of charts. Our EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the $19.15 to $19.45 range, nearly 10% higher than our results in 2018. And we expect cash from operations will be equal to or greater than $7.4 billion, recognizing both the invoices that carried over into 2019 from 2018 and an improved outlook from the business areas for the year. Chart 10 shows the expected business area ranges for both sales and segment operating profit for the year. Missiles and Fire Control is again expected to be our fastest growing business area with around 10% growth over 2018, while Aeronautics is expected to grow in the high single-digit level. RMS and Space are both expected to have slight increases over their 2018 results. Margins for the business areas are roughly comparable to our performance in 2018 except for Space, which has impacted this year by lower equity earnings at ULA as we discussed on the last call. On Chart 11, we provide a comparison of our net FAS/CAS adjustment and our current outlook compared with the preliminary review we provided in October. The return on plan assets during 2018 was negative 5% versus a positive 1% return when we spoke in October, reflecting the large reductions in equity returns that occurred between October and the end of the year and this change in our return lowered the adjustment by $120 million. The discount rate used to value our liabilities increased slightly to 4.25% and this results in a $60 million improvement. Other actuarial updates to the plan, primarily a revised longevity expectation contributed to a $35 million of improvement. All told, these updates lower the FAS/CAS adjustment by $25 million to our new expectation of $1.475 billion. And, finally, at the bottom of the chart, we mentioned two pension risk mitigation transactions that we completed in December, but have no significant impact on either our financial results in 2018 or our projections for 2019 and we'll describe these transactions in more detail on the next chart. Chart 12 summarizes the two pension transactions that occurred in December. These transactions are transferring the responsibility for pension obligation for around 41,000 or a little more than 25% of our current retirees to two insurers. There is no change in the timing or amount of pension payments to our retirees, but with the transfer we've eliminated all volatility associated with $2.5 billion of current pension obligations. We had favorable pricing on the transfer and we immediately see a $25 million per year reduction in our PBGC premiums going forward, and we have the option to settle around $800 million of planned liabilities with the U.S. government at a future date, which would accelerate CAS prepayments into the year of settlement, increasing our cash from operations in that year by the amount of the CAS acceleration. So we think this creates a win-win situation, providing the same benefits to retirees going forward, while reducing future volatility for the business and our customers. And, finally, on Chart 13, we have our summary. 2018 was an outstanding year for both operational and financial performance. We're very pleased with the record backlog that we achieved last year and that all four business areas contributed to that record level. And we're very excited to continue to deliver growth and long-term value creation in 2019 and beyond. With that, we're ready for questions. John?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Bruce, many congrats to you. It was great working with you; and Ken, welcome on-board.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Noah.
Kenneth Possenriede: Thank you.
Noah Poponak: Bruce, so with the cash flow guidance for 2019, it looks like it’s maybe slightly better operationally than you thought before and then you had the slippage out of 2018. So, one, is that true that it's a little better operationally? And then two, I guess for - year-over-year into 2020, you previously had a placeholder of something in the zone of flat, can you still be flat to slightly up in 2020 even with the working capital lift that I guess is specific to 2019? And then may be update us, I think you'd previously said, on '21 when the pension contribution comes back online that you saw enough working capital opportunity to offset that and grow cash flow again. Is that still the case?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So let me dive into that, I think it's a three- parter there, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Got to get it in before you go.
Bruce Tanner: Very good of you. So yes, we are operationally seeing improved cash from operations in 2019. Part of that is simply because we are having higher profit from the business areas and in the form of segment operating profit and we would expect to recover some of that in terms of cash in 2019. So it's a combination just as you described it. The carryover in invoices, call it, $250 million or so plus some improvement in operations from the business areas making up the difference to get to $400 million. You asked about 2020 flat to up. I'd say we are still seeing the outlook for probably both 2020 and 2021 in the 7 - at least $7 billion or greater range. We've had a little bit of pressure as you might expect, because of the lower performance of our pension plan. So just like everyone else from October to December, as I described in my prepared remarks, the pension trust went for a slightly positive return to a 5% negative. But if you take a look at the total change and expectations of assets to asset return to where we ended up, that's a pretty big miss. And so, we'll have some continued higher ERISA payments that start to kick in about the 2020 timeframe, higher than what we talked about in the last call and higher still than what we talked about, I think, on the last call in 2021. Even with those higher ERISA contributions to sort of refill the pension trust for the asset performance last year, we still expect to achieve another $7 billion-plus in each of those payments - in each of those years, excuse me, going forward. And that is a reflection, Noah, to your question of improved performance and working capital as well as the higher segment operating profit and return of cash resulting from that in the next couple of years.
Operator: Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Just on the F-35, there's clear signs that it's growing and there is continued growth in the program. How do we, maybe, think about the cadence of that 400 aircraft conversion and maybe the profit curve on that program given international and as the block buy versus the multiyear?
Bruce Tanner: Everyone is going to do three-parters this time, ah?
Sheila Kahyaoglu: One topic, three parts.
Bruce Tanner: So, yeah, F-35's got a real good cadence. I thought it was really interesting to listen to Marillyn talk about the fact that we got more aircraft at the end of the year in terms of backlog than we’ve delivered since the inception of the program. That's a - just thinking about that, that's a big number. And that reflected for the block buy getting, call it, 250 aircrafts worth of - sort of advance payment and that was the large award that we booked in the fourth quarter. But it's only, what, 250 out of what we expect LRIP 12, 13 and 14 to be which is closer to about 400 - call it, 475 to 480 aircrafts. So we would expect over time to get those higher quantities of aircraft and you'll see that reflect in the backlog going forward. You will also see, Sheila, growth in our expected deliveries going forward from 91 this year to about 131, I said 91 this year, 91 in 2018 to about 131 next year. And that number will grow slightly higher in 2020 and slightly higher still in 2021, at least that's the expectation until we actually get north of 160 deliveries in 2021, so good continuing ramp up there. You asked about margins, we see - we had good performance in 2018 and we expect to see especially on the production program some continued good performance. I would expect margins to maybe increase 50-plus basis points over what we saw in 2018 as we sort of get to a more steady-state of what we expect to have as we've talked about for quite some time of margin similar to our experience on other production programs in our portfolios, including F-16, F-22 and C-130s and the like. And the only thing I might offer up, Sheila, is, we're seeing production growth as I talked about with the quantities of aircraft, but we're also seeing some pretty significant sustainment growth and I think I have said this on the last call, somewhat surprisingly, actually on a percentage basis the fastest growing part of the F-35 program is actually the development program. And that's because we're starting to get modifications of the aircrafts, some international peculiar updates for improvements going forward. So that's actually growing as well. And as I think I said on prior calls, well, that's typically cost reimbursable and therefore lower margin overall than the program, that still good work that leads to future production and/or sustainment work going forward. So program is in a very good position right now and on a strong cadence as we end 2018 and going into 2019.
Operator: Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: Bruce, can you touch a little bit on the - just on the - kind of related to Noah’s question in terms of cash sustainability, obviously cash recovery is a big piece of that operating cash flow, that $7 billion, just given that what you know has happened in 2018? Now, any update on the shape of that cash number going forward? How long [is it with us] [ph] till it roll off there? Thank you.
Bruce Tanner: So we've talked about in the past that whenever there is a change in expectations relative to our performance and we're more sensitive, I think I've said that in the past as we sit here today, on asset returns than we are on discount rates with our pension financials going forward. So because we were short of our expectations in 2018, you will see a slight increase in the near-term of CAS to essentially recoup that shortage in our expectations over time. Unfortunately, ERISA requires an earlier contribution than I even - even after we've had CAS [normalization] [ph], we should still think of CAS recovery on our contract takes longer to occur than the ERISA contributions, and that's the comment that I was making earlier to Noah about a little bit of higher ERISA contributions in the near-term. But to your question, Jon, CAS will - I think in 2018, we're about 2.4, call it, a little more than that billion dollars. I would think CAS at the new levels based on our performance in 2018 will probably stay at the, call it, 2.5, I think we're a little higher than that level of CAS reimbursements in 2019. And then it sort of stays that way in '20, '21, '22 and then current course and speed if we continue to get 7% returns on the assets going forward, we would expect to see a significant reduction in CAS costing and CAS recoveries from '22 to, call it, 2026 and beyond to a very, very steep down slope in terms of CAS reductions there. So sort of not much change in the next three, four years and then if we continue on the current course and speed or we do better on asset returns going forward, then we would expect to see a pretty good size reduction in that. You would also expect to see at a quicker pace a reduction in the ERISA contributions, because ERISA is spread over shorter period of time to sort of recoup the asset return miss we had in 2018 than is the CAS spread, if you will. So CAS is spread longer to recoup that. Hope that helps, Jon.
Operator: And our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: When you look at the backlog build, right, I guess a lot of that had to do with F-35 and the year-end backlog was, I think, probably a little bit above what you guys were thinking in Q3, right. And then I look at the guidance for the year, I mean how much conservatism is built in there? Because it just looks like with that kind of backlog build that revenue growth this year might be a little bit better. I don't know I'm just kind of throwing that one out there?
Bruce Tanner: Well, I guess if I was smart I'd set Ken up for a bigger number than a lower number, but I think we've got opportunities varying and we talk about Missiles and Fire Control growing 10%. We talked about Aeronautics growing at the high single-digit. Space and RMS, a very slight growth. If there's one business area I think that might have some potential revenue upside, I would say, it's probably RMS. We sort of went into the year last year expecting RMS to be a little flattish, maybe a little bit of growth and I think we ended up at 4% or so growth for the year. So we beat that pretty well. I think there's a similar potential here. We've got - I'll tell you, we've got a lot of new start programs. I mean, I was looking for list, getting ready for the call, it's just staggering, how many small literal new start pattern, that could translate into large patterns across all four business areas, so one of the sound bites I like more than anything is that while backlog grew for the corporation to a record level backlog grew for each of the four business areas. So this is very broad-based and very strong. Again, not so much in huge big bite-sized chunks but a lot of smaller patterns is really what's driving that. And so, to your question, Ron, I think we have some potential upside, but I don't-we didn't purposely try to be ultraconservative in the revenue guidance. I think that's why we provide the range and that's why the upside is potentially at the top of the range. I should have said, maybe they'll just a piggyback, I didn't answer I think Sheila's last question on the multiyear and that may be part of what you're asking about as well. But we would expect to see a multiyear agreement on the F-35 program probably sometime in the 2022 timeframe, so while we may see some slight backlog deterioration this year, it's hard to replicate the large block buy order that we saw in 2018. We still expect to be probably north of $125 billion of backlog as we end the year and then that has the potential to grow from that level as we get into 2022 with the benefit of an F-35 block - excuse me, multiyear.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Bruce, I will spare you a pension question and just wish you the best for your retirement.
Bruce Tanner: You break my heart with that pension question, Rob.
Rob Stallard: But Marilyn I have one for you. On the F-35 front, there's been various press reports that the DOD could be flirting with an F-16 order and comments from the Acting Secretary of Defense today seems to imply that there could be some pressure perhaps ahead for you on pricing for the F-35. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on that?
Marillyn Hewson: I would be happy to, Rob. In terms of the F-35, as we've outlined clearly, I mean it's well supported across the board regardless of what other platforms, the Department of Defense was looking at. So if they chose to have an order on F-15, I don't - it won't be at the expensive of F-35 quantities. I mean, I'm hearing that directly from leadership in the Pentagon and I think that's an important point to make, not just our suspicion, but I've been told that directly. So, I'm not concerned about that. In terms of the pressure on the unit cost, we continue to have focus collectively with the Joint Program Office and with the Department of Defense on driving the price of the F-35 down and seeing the cost. We are on a path to drive it to an $80 million for the F-35A by full rate production when we're looking at 2023 deliveries of that aircraft and when we get to about 15 deliveries. So that's - as long as we stay on our procurement rate plan, which by all accounts we're going to continue to ramp up the rate that we envisioned and we're going to continue to drive the price down and that's our target as to continue drive the unit cost down. And we won't stop there, we will always be looking at ways that we can take the cost down in the program as it continues to mature and grows. Moreover, the total life cycle cost of the aircraft is coming down. We're working on the sustainment element, which is always something that our customers are interested in, not just purchase price but what does it cost to sustain the aircraft as its operational and those costs are coming down at a good pace as well.
Operator: Next we'll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: One clarification and then one question, so Bruce you mentioned the headwind on ULA, I'm just curious if it's still $150 million? And the question, maybe for Marilyn, you're seeing the start of some of the first incremental customers coming to the F-35 in quite some time. Do you think there is actually pressure to the upside from these 160 per year, probably planning rates that you've had for a number of years. I know you have gotten request for something higher than that, but at what point do you think there's reality behind some of those requests for pricing for upward of 180 per year pricing?
Bruce Tanner: Well, I'll take the first part. You've got a good memory, Myles. We did talk, I think on the October call about as much as $150 million pressure from ULA year-over-year from 2018 to 2019. I think you should think of that closer to maybe like $100 million now. And part of that is, we did get a little better outlook from ULA, but that's part of it. But the bigger piece quite honestly was, we actually had a launch vehicle that we had expected to deliver in the latter part of December, that for weather purposes and some other purposes, actually slipped into 2019. In fact, you might have seen - that was the first launch of the year. It was actually an event that was supposed to have occurred last year. So think of that launch carrying on for and the profits associated with that launch vehicle also carrying over, which made that $150 million along with the improved performance expectation at ULA cause a number to, like I said, probably be about a $100 million short of last year's ULA equity earnings amount. And I'll turn it over to Marillyn for the F-35 question.
Marillyn Hewson: Yes, Myles, to your question about the growth in the international demand for the program, we are certainly seeing with a highlight of few near-term things, but F-35 is in the competitions in Switzerland and Finland and Germany and whole range of countries that continue to look at it. So we expect to continue to see growth in the international demand. Your question around, can we increase the rate accordingly or so forth. I mean, it's really too early to be too specific on that, but over time if we could see that we could exceed the current program of record on the F-35 and that would open up the opportunity for us to produce more per year. And we have the manufacturing capacity for over 180 aircraft per year. We'll still have to coordinate with the JPO, the Joint Program Office, we'll still have to work with our supply chain and our international customers to really get the most effective plan possible. But we could certainly go to a higher rate if the demand were such that we needed to do that. So that's a good problem to have and we look forward to that.
Myles Walton: And Japan?
Marillyn Hewson: And also Japan, yes, I mentioned Japan already in my formal remarks about the increase there as they have already committed to 105 aircraft and we expect some of the existing customers to continue to increase their demand for the aircraft as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Bruce, let me join the others and say you've done absolutely terrific, and best of wishes in your retirement.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Cai.
Cai von Rumohr: So in line with the two-part question, book-to-bill, if you could comment a little bit by the outlook for the year in the sectors? And secondly, you said, as I understood it, that the F-35 had may be 50 bps of margin upside. I thought that was in 2019. And if so, where is the downside? Because your aggregate guide shows Aeronautical margins relatively stable - may be up 10 bps?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So let me - I'll try to address both of those for you, Cai. So book-to-bill, the 15, although there was obviously the 2018 results. The outlook for 2019, which I think is the heart of your question, we expect to have less orders in 2019 as you might expect, since we're not going to replicate the block buy order for F-35. But as I said in response to a previous question, I think backlog - if we had a little more than $130 billion now, I think we dropped, call it, $4 million or $5 million to maybe a $125 billion plus. So we still expect to have a strong orders year in 2019. I think just for planning purposes, the things that you should watch out for is we are hopeful to get pretty large THAAD order for both combined by from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as well as MDA or ultimately to the U.S. Army in the first quarter. As it turns out a little bit unusual compared to our pattern maybe in prior years, the second quarter is expected to be our largest order quarter and that's in part because we'll start - or at least we expect to start to definitize the LRIP 12, 13 and 14 that was authorized by the block buy. This would be just for the LRIP 12 portion and that definitization is a fairly good-sized number, call it north of $5 billion is the item there as well as some other orders we expect there. For instance, we expect to get an order for two Orion vehicles in the second quarter as well. And may be somewhat surprisingly just given the size compared to years previously, they got a multiple launch rocket system, 14, as we're calling it is about $1 billion order that we're looking to see potentially in the second quarter. So a little different phasing, as I said, for the orders in 2019 still strong, quite honestly not a whole lot of competitive awards there, most of them are sort of soul-source follow-on awards and without the benefit, as I said, earlier the block buy behind us or the potential for multiyear on F-35 in front of us. So, hopefully, that help sort of the orders in our expectation. F-35, the 50 basis points that I was talking about is my expectation of improvement on the F-35 program for the 2019 margins compared to 2018 margins, a lot of that coming on the production program as we really are starting to kind of hit, as I said earlier, sort of cadence there. And why that's offset is part of what I said earlier, Cai. I mean, literally there is - I think I'm literally writing down 15, 16 programs. They're all smaller than the large programs that I'm talking about that have the margin increases, but we have got classified activity in three of the four business areas that starting to get some traction. Aeronautics is one of those where we have that. We've got Hypersonics work in Aeronautics. So a lot of, sort of, new start programs, including as I said earlier we're having growth in the sustainment and the development program on the F-35 program actually at a faster rate than the production rate is. And that's great news, but it does come with a slightly lower margins or the combination of all the new starts faster growing on some of the legacy stuff within the F-35 programs with lower margin, that's the reason why you don't see the overall Aeronautics margin growing from its - sort if it's level. We're frankly happy with that, because that says we're sort of growing margin in the programs that you think should be growing margins, but we're getting the benefit of new programs - new start programs that have the potential to be the long-term growth engines of the corporation and, of course, those come with lower margins.
Operator: And next we'll go to Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Marillyn, maybe a question about politics in D.C. I feel like a lot of people are thinking that getting this last two-year resolution to the sequester might be maybe the most difficult compared to - than we've had so far. Would you agree with that? Is it going to be a challenge just kind of given where the parties are at or I know recently some of the - both parties that are directly involved on the defense committee seem to be a little bit more optimistic, but where do you kind of come down there? And how do you're thinking about timing on that?
Marillyn Hewson: Yes, that's a great question. I wish I had a crystal ball to answer it, but I would just say that and we - as you know, predominance of our U.S. government business is the Defense business. And so, I think last year were around 59% or 60% of our revenue was U.S. - was Department of Defense. Of course, we have NASA, Homeland Security and other pieces of it. But what I am hearing in my discussions with Members of Congress is the bipartisan support for defense spending. I mean there is no doubt that the threats are getting greater around the world. We've - you've seen the National Defenses Strategy that came out. You've seen the National Security Strategy, which I think have been much more direct about the great power competition with China and Russia and also the other players like Iran and North Korea and others. I mean, it's just - it's not getting lighter, it's getting accelerated, and with that we know that not only is there a global threat accelerating and growing, but in addition to that we need to recapitalize. And so there needs to be expenditure on recapitalization and our weapon systems as well as research and development on all the technology changes and unpredictable nature of the balance space as we're seeing as our adversaries taking advantage of all that technology. So when you go look at what has been outlined in that National Defense Strategy, it's clear that what is requested aligns very well with our portfolio. I highlighted some of it in my earlier remarks, but all of the things that need to be spent on, whether it's on the nuclear or space or the C4ISR or all those elements of intelligence capabilities and air dominance et cetera are all areas that we play in and that we think our portfolio is very well aligned with. The one area I think we all are trying to watch is now, how much pressure there will be on putting more spending in the domestic non-defense side of spending. And so, that would be the pressure point that we'll all watch, because I think if you've seen what's been brought forward by the President's - earlier President's Budget request, we're expecting to see the updated one that comes out for 2020, there's been a strong focus on defense. And so, it will just be a matter of how that plays against the non-defense spending and we are hopeful that it will line up with what we need as a nation, which is to protect our citizens and focus on national security.
Operator: And the next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thank. Bruce, I also want to give you my congratulations. Job well done.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Dave.
David Strauss: Now I pay you with pension. As far as the contribution, would you mind spelling out exactly kind of what you're thinking about for '20 and '21, now? I think before you were saying couple of hundred million in '20 and like $1.5 million in '21? And then the second parter on CapEx. Can you talk about what you're thinking there and how that kind of comes through in terms of higher depreciation over the next couple of years? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: David, I'd be disappointed if we had our last conversation and you didn't ask me about pension. So I appreciate the question there. 2020 ERISA contributions, I think we talked about those being in a couple of hundred million dollars level last time we spoke in October. Again, that was before - the roughly 6% swing in asset returns that happened from October to the end of the year. If those - and this is a little bit fluid, because things can change between now and then obviously with good performance in 2019 and we're actually off to a good start as I'm sure everyone is in the first month or so in 2019 in terms of asset returns, so bear that in mind when I say this, but if we were to have drawn the line at the end of 2018 with the performance when we left it at a 5% negative return. We'd probably see at least a couple of hundred million dollars more contribution in 2020. And then relative to - I think you said it right, it was about $1.6 billion or so - $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion I think where it was in 2021, probably also a couple of hundred million dollars and you should think of that as back to the phasing of ERISA to recover asset return shortfalls is sort of spread over like a - not quite a decade long, call it, nine years or so. And the recovery from a CAS is sort of spread over a longer period, call it or 12 or 13 years. So at any one point in time, we'll have more - at the front end of that time period, we'll have more contributions required to ERISA. At the back-end, we'll have no ERISA contributions and peer recovery from a CAS perspective. So think of that again several hundred million dollars up in both years 2020 and 2021 as we sit here today with the potential that that could change based on good performance in 2019. I'm sorry, David, I forgot, you also asked about CapEx and depreciation. So, we're going to increase capital expenditures in 2019, probably think of it as - I think we finished last year 2018 about $1.3 billion. Our outlook is probably $300 million or $400 million higher than that in 2017 - 2019 and we'll probably pretty close to that in 2020. And the drivers of that are some things we have talked about previously. We've got some completion of a facility at our Space Systems, our Space operations in Denver to help with a more efficient way to build and deliver satellites and as well as get some capacity there. We have got significant growth in Missiles and Fire Control, both from a building perspective to house some employee growth that we talked about on some previous calls, but also both infrastructure equipment and buildings for that matter to increase capacity, primarily in our weapons business, as we talked about previously. So we're - that's a good news thing. We're spending money to increase the CapEx, but that is in turn increasing the capital or the capacity of our weapons program at Missiles and Fire Control. We've also got and I think I mentioned this previously, we've also got several awards and I know I have mentioned this earlier in the call, but classified contracts sort of around the corporation. Some of those actually come with capital needs as well, but that is to feed, again, the capabilities to support that growing classified business going forward. So all of those are growing faster than our depreciation recovery as you might expect, but that's good news. That's where the future growth at both the top end and the bottom end of the business will come from and ultimately our depreciation will catch up. It's sort of like the pension asset return. It's just a little bit delayed there. So we're happy to be sending of the capital to the levels we had today and we look forward to the growth of that CapEx will drive from a capacity perspective going forward.
Greg Gardner: John, we're coming over the top of the hour. We'll take one more question.
Operator: And that will be from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Carter Copeland: Thanks for fitting me in, and Bruce let me take a second and also extend my congrats on what's been a great performance on the role. I hope you really enjoy your retirement.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Carter.
Carter Copeland: I will stick to the one in the interest of time and that's on MFC and Bruce wondered if you could just may be dig into the performance a little bit there? You obviously had a very strong profit performance and you call that risk retirements and volume are being the source of that. Should we assume that the vast majority of that was risk retirements? Because I would assume that the classified shrink that you called out on the top line would've had a negative mix impact. So, anything you do to kind of help us understand what drove that result?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. I think you characterized it appropriately, Carter. We did have as we closed the year out some really good performance on a couple of programs that resulted in higher risk retirements. We are seeing, as you also point out, some growing volume at lower margins, primarily in the classified arena. But again if I just sort of rattle off some programs in Missiles and Fire Control that are helping to contribute to some of the higher growth but lower margin business. We're seeing that on the classified business. Missiles and Fire Control is heavily, heavily involved in Hypersonic's work. Indirectly it got some sort of Directed Energy work as well. The JAGM replacement, so I think of that as the Hellfire replacement is starting to see some early production volume, which is great news but it is lower margins than the legacy Hellfire program. Ultimately, we think that will be comparable but not at this early stage of development and production. So, a lot of good growth coming. Again, the fastest growing business area in the corporation, both for legacy programs, but frankly most of the legacy growth is going to be a little bit delayed, it requires the capital expenditures that I talked about previously to get most of that growth in there. So, we're seeing that offset in the near-term by growth on a lot of new start programs. And, again, that's the great news, because this is the Cyclone for future growth at Missiles and Fire Control that will last for the next decade or so. And, as a result of all that, we're looking at margins pretty comparable for the year at Missiles and Fire Control in 2019 to 2018. And, again, just as I said earlier, you should think of that as the programs where you would think margins are improving, they are. And it's sort of being mitigated by a lot of smaller and new start programs with lower margins as they begin their production or development phases.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, John. I think I'll end the call now by turning it over to Marillyn for some final thoughts.
Marillyn Hewson: Thank you, Greg. Before I conclude the call there, I would like to take a moment to celebrate the career and upcoming retirement of Bruce Tanner. Bruce began his career more than 37 years ago in Fort Worth, where he worked on the F-16 program. And like the F-16 itself, Bruce has been a driving force in this company's success for many years. For the past 11-plus years, Bruce has been our Chief Financial Officer, so many of you have gotten to know him through the past 46 earnings calls and his participation in numerous investor meetings and conferences, and you know that Bruce is thoughtful, honest and even keeled. He's always prepared and he does his best to answer every question that comes from our investors and analysts. And I personally consider it an honor and pleasure to have had the opportunity to work with Bruce in many points throughout my career. Within our company, we have benefited from his deep expertise, his strategic focus and his leadership. Regardless of the challenges we faced at any given time, Bruce has helped our company grow and flourish. Because of his commitment to mentoring and building up others, his impact and his influence will shape Lockheed Martin for decades to come. Many of you know that we put tremendous focus on strong leadership talent development and succession planning at Lockheed Martin. That's why as Bruce transitions out, we're delighted to welcome Ken Possenriede as our CFO on February 11th. Ken and I have also worked closely together, dating back to our days leading the Electronic Systems business area and more recently as our Corporate Treasurer and Finance Executive at our Space and Aeronautics business area. His experience and track record are impeccable and I look forward to maintaining our momentum with Ken at the helm of our high end organization. So we wish Bruce the very best for his well-earned retirement later this year as he returns to Texas to enjoy more time with his family, including his three grandchildren. Bruce, on behalf of our shareholders and our employees, I thank you for your leadership and your outstanding contribution. And Ken, we welcome you to the team.
A - Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn.

Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call today. As today's release illustrates, we continue to outperform the goals we set at the beginning of 2018, with another quarter of strong operational accomplishments, important new business awards and outstanding financial results. We've seen strong financial performance across the entire corporation. And this performance, coupled with our improved outlook for the remainder of the year, has resulted in us updating our guidance again this quarter. I'm especially pleased to see our earnings and cash expectations continue to grow as we remain focused on operational performance and delivering long-term value to shareholders. Our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance and improved full year projections are the result of the strength provided by our broad portfolio of offerings as each of our 4 business areas contributed to our updated 2018 financial outlook. We will discuss the financials in detail a little later in the call, but I do want to highlight two key actions that our Board of Directors took this quarter in the area of cash deployment. First, we increased the quarterly dividend by 10% to $2.20 per share or $8.80 annually, maintaining our long-standing commitment to a strong dividend. Second, we also increased our share repurchase authority by $1 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to $3.7 billion. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit. Together, these two actions demonstrate our continued strategy of balanced cash deployment and long-term commitment to delivering returns for our stockholders.  I'll cover performance highlights in just a moment, but I want to begin by noting several strategic new business awards that we received this quarter, which position us for long-term growth in our existing portfolio, as well as affording us exciting new opportunities. In August, our Lockheed Martin Space team received an initial $2.9 billion reward from U.S. Air Force for 3 next-generation missile warning satellites. These overhead persistent infrared, or OPIR, satellites build upon our legacy SBIRS spacecraft with a modernized bus and increased survivability, delivering advanced early warning and improved resiliency. We look forward to delivering these next-gen capabilities with this new opportunity. [Technical Difficulty] competitor contract of over $1.3 billion for the first two GPS follow-on satellites, with a total estimated contract value of up to $7.2 billion for 22 new GPS-IIIF spacecraft. These new GPS space vehicles are designed to provide greater accuracy and improved anti-jamming capabilities, providing the technology upgrades to ensure GPS-III remains the gold standard in navigation, positioning and timing. Moving to our Aeronautics business area. We secured approximately $1.7 billion in orders for 22 additional C-130J transport planes. The results of the increases included in 2017 and 2018 fiscal year omnibus appropriations legislation. These awards bring our C-130J backlog to 70 aircraft, another example of the enduring demand for this legendary platform. In Missiles and Fire Control, we were very excited to be awarded the $480 million Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW program, to provide critical design review and production readiness support for new hypersonic weapon. The ARRW contract marks our third 2018 award in this emerging technological area, and when combined with the previously announced Tactical Boost Glide and Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon, or HCSW programs, brings the aggregate value of our 2018 hypersonic awards to over $1.5 billion. We were disappointed, though, at not being selected for 3 large competitive bids this quarter. We believe our proposals represented outstanding technical offerings at our lowest possible pricing. Had we matched the winning prices and been awarded the contracts, we estimate that we would have incurred cumulative losses across all three programs in excess of $5 billion, an outcome that we do not feel would have been in the best interest of our stockholders or our customers. As we conduct our lessons learned process, we will seek to discover any root cause issues which may lead us to alter our future capture strategies. However, our objective will always be to position the corporation to perform with excellence for our customers while delivering outstanding value to our stockholders. Our new business pipeline remains robust and our win rates remain strong. The strategic awards I noted earlier contributed to the corporation recording over $18 billion in awards during the third quarter and allowed our backlog to climb to over $109 billion, a new high watermark. Turning briefly to the Department of Defense budgets. The President signed into law the DoD 2019 fiscal year appropriations act last month, the first time in a decade that an appropriations bill has been enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year. The act provides approximately $670 billion of base budget funding for the nation's security and defense programs. The legislation aligns with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which provided with an additional $80 billion for national defense over 2 years in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019.  The final FY '19 appropriations also reflect continued support for our broad portfolio as funding was increased from the Presidential budget request for some of our key programs, including 16 additional F-35 jets; 14 additional THAAD interceptors, 8 additional C-130J aircraft; 8 additional BLACK HAWK helicopters and 2 additional Littoral Combat Ships. These increases were supported by both House and Senate appropriations committees and reflects strong bipartisan support for these platforms. Moving on, I'd like to highlight several significant milestones we achieved across the corporation during the past quarter, beginning with an update on our F-35 program. We saw 4 significant events take place this quarter. In September, we finalized an $11.5 billion Low-Rate Initial Production, or LRIP, 11 contract with the Department of Defense for the production and delivery of 141 F-35 aircraft. Notably, we came to agreement on unit prices, which are the lowest in program history, with the F-35A, our conventional takeoff and landing, or CTOL variant, achieving an $89.2 million price, a 5.4% reduction from the LRIP 10 per unit amount. We remain focused on delivering the best value to our U.S. services, international partner nations and Foreign Military Sales customers as we continue to pursue achieving an $80 million CTOL target price. The F-35 program also continued its maturation process as it was approved to transition into the operational test and evaluation, or OTE phase, in November. The Defense Department had certified the programs readiness to enter the OTE phase, one of the final steps being approved for full rate production.  Also in September, F-35 aircraft participated in their first U.S. combat mission as the U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs successfully conducted an air strike in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel ground clearance operations in Afghanistan.  The Marine Corps was the first service to declare the F-35 ready for initial operational capability in 2017, and the aircraft has been deployed as part of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group, enabling enhanced stability and security from international waters and demonstrating the remarkable capabilities of this fifth-generation fighter. Lastly, on the F-35. We were all extremely proud to see our U.K. Ministry of Defense partner celebrate an F-35B performing its first carrier landing as British pilots touched down on the HMS Queen Elizabeth in the Atlantic Ocean, laying the foundation for the future of fixed-wing aviation aboard the U.K. carrier fleet. The F-35 subsequently took flight using the ship's ski ramp platform and later performed successful night landings on the carrier, both with and without the use of night vision technology. The F-35 and the HMS Queen Elizabeth are at the beginning of the 2-month developmental test process to establish the envelope for the F-35 to operate from the deck of the ship, and we are very happy to be part of these landmark events. Moving to our Missiles and Fire Control business area. We saw strong domestic and international demand for our tactical missile products this quarter, as well as continued international PAC-3 support in our air and missile defense organization.  In our tactical missiles organization, we were awarded an FMS contract totaling over $630 million to provide Hellfire missiles to the Netherlands and Japan. Our tactical missiles team also received a pair of awards totaling over $0.5 billion for 42 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, launchers and associated hardware to be delivered to the U.S. Army and international customers.  Earlier this quarter, U.S. and Swedish officials formalized an agreement to provide PAC-3 MSE missiles to the government of Sweden, helping to increase the country's defensive capabilities and support interoperability with U.S. and NATO forces. Sweden will become the sixth international customer to sign an agreement for PAC-3 MSE missiles, and we look forward to providing our leading-edge missile defense products in support of their national security objectives. I'll close with our Rotary and Mission Systems business area and discuss several noteworthy achievements from our Sikorsky team. First, the Sikorsky S-97 Raider prototype helicopter demonstrated the ability to fly at speeds exceeding 200 knots during recent flight testing at our Sikorsky development flight center. The Raider aircraft incorporates our Collier award-winning X2 Technology, a suite of capabilities, which include our innovative counter-rotating blade design, fly-by-wire flight controls and advanced vehicle management systems to provide a critical speed and handling quality needed by today's warfighter. The X2 technology allows for speeds twice that of conventional helicopters, and we look forward to offering this unique solution to the U.S. Army as it begins to revolutionize its aircraft fleet as part of the upcoming Future Vertical Lift program.  I would also like to congratulate the Sikorsky team on an upcoming milestone as October 31 will mark the 40th anniversary of the first BLACK HAWK delivery to the U.S. Army in 1978. The iconic BLACK HAWK helicopter has more than 10 million flight hours, supporting our army customers' brave missions and has played a key role in humanitarian efforts, aerial firefighting and border patrols as well. Over 4,000 BLACK HAWKs of all types are in service worldwide. And I would like to thank the Sikorsky organization for their dedication in delivering this remarkable aircraft to our customers for the past 40 years. And we look forward to continuing this partnership for years to come. These two significant accomplishments come at a time when we will be recognizing another key milestone. This November, we will mark the third anniversary of Sikorsky aircraft joining the Lockheed Martin family. The Sikorsky organization has expanded and strengthened our corporation's portfolio over the short time, and I would like to thank the entire team for their efforts as we celebrate this important occasion. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Once again, we exceeded our expectations for every financial metric in the quarter as we did through the first half of this year. Sales, segment operating profit and cash from operations before making our final pension contribution for the year continued to be strong. The $1.5 billion pension contributions we made in the third quarter completes the $5 billion of pension outlays that we've been discussing all year. We continued our cash deployment actions in the quarter, returning around $800 million of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. And we grew our backlog to a record $109 billion in the quarter, with all 4 business areas contributing to that growth. Based on our performance in the quarter, we expect strong results for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations for the full year, as we'll show in a few charts.  We were pleased with how our financial results are shaping up thus far in 2018, and we'll be discussing how our performance this year is carrying over into next year when we get to our charts showing preliminary trends for 2019 later in the presentation. Turning to Chart 4. We compare our sales and segment operating profit in the third quarter of this year with last year's results. I'll note for comparison purposes that the third quarter of this year has 14 weeks in the accounting period while last year's third quarter had 13 weeks in the accounting period, and this situation will reverse itself in the fourth quarter when we have 13 weeks this year and will compare to 14 weeks in the fourth quarter of last year. Even without the extra week in the quarter, our results exceeded our expectations. With that background, sales grew 16% compared with the same quarter last year to $14.3 billion, continuing the momentum we had in the first two quarters, while segment operating profit increased 23% over last year's level to nearly $1.6 billion.  And all four business areas contributed to the significant increases in both sales and profit in the quarter, while the margin increases in the quarter were driven primarily by RMS due to improved performance in our Sikorsky and integrated warfare systems and sensors lines of businesses and by Space due to improved performance in our government satellites line of business. On Chart 5, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS of $5.14 was $1.82 or 55% higher than our results last year, driven by higher sales volume, the margin improvements that I just discussed and a lower tax rate in the quarter compared to last year. Moving on to Chart 6. We provide our revised outlook for the year. With only the fourth quarter left in the year, we are providing our best point estimate of results for the entire year rather than the ranges we have provided in previous quarters. We expect sales to be around $53 billion for the year, near the top of the guidance range we provided last quarter and 6% higher than our results in 2017. At $5.8 billion, our forecasted segment operating profit will exceed the top end of our guidance range last quarter, resulting in a 10.9% margin, about 70 basis points higher than last year's results. Our FAS/CAS pension adjustment remains unchanged at a little more than $1 billion. Our earnings per share is expected to be around $17.50, also above the high end of our previous guidance range, recognizing the strong performance in our business segment operating profit as well as a lower tax rate in our lower estimates, which I'll discuss further in a moment. And we're increasing our outlook for cash from operations by $100 million to be equal to or greater than $3.4 billion as we expect a large portion of our earnings increase to be billed and collected before year-end. Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our earnings per share outlook this quarter compared to last quarter. Operational performance is expected to drive a $0.40 increase in EPS, driven by higher segment operating profit as a result of higher sales volume and margins in our business areas. Taxes and other are expected to add another $0.20 in EPS, with most of that increase coming from a lower tax rate as we continue to reflect the latest understanding of the tax legislation passed last year. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 13.5% and 14%. Together, these changes represent an expected $0.60 improvement from the midpoint of the EPS range we provided last quarter to a new outlook of $17.50 per share.  Chart 8 shows our new outlook for sales by business area for the year, also with point estimates for each of the business areas rather than the ranges we provided in the prior outlook. We are increasing our sales outlook by $650 million compared to the midpoint of our last guidance. We expect it to be near or slightly above the high end of the guidance range from last quarter, continuing the strong results we've seen so far this year. On Chart 9, we provide a similar view of our new outlook for segment operating profit by business area for the year. We're increasing our segment operating profit outlook by $150 million from the midpoint of the range we provided last quarter, and our point estimate is above the high end of that range. Three of the 4 business areas are expected to exceed the high end of their prior range, showing the broad-based nature of our performance improvements. On Chart 10, we provide our preliminary look at our 2019 trends. We expect our 2019 sales level will grow 5% to [Technical Difficulty] '18 sales, which equates to approximately a 6% to 7% increase over the midpoint in the 2018 guidance range we provided in July. We expect our segment operating margin will remain strong at between 10.5% and 10.8%. This margin level assumes similar performance in our legacy programs in all business areas with some dilution resulting from the growing number of new start programs, as the increases in our backlog levels would indicate. We also expect to have lower equity earnings associated with the ULA business as a result of the number and mix of launches expected in 2019 compared with 2018. We estimate that our cash from operations will be at least $7 billion, as we've noted in previous calls, and we have no planned pension contributions next year.  We also plan to have at least $1 billion in share repurchases, about the same levels we expect to have in 2018, more than offsetting any planned share issuances in the year. And similar to 2018, we have a debt maturity coming due next year worth $900 million. Moving to our FAS/CAS outlook. We expect our 2019 FAS/CAS adjustment will be approximately $1.5 billion or about $500 million higher than the adjustment for 2018. This estimate assumes a discount rate at the end of the year of 4.125% or 50 basis points above the 2018 rate. Based on our performance to-date, we are assuming a 1% return on our assets for the full year. And going forward, we are reducing our long-term asset return assumption by 50 basis points to 7% per year. All told, we expect to see continued strong growth in the 2019 based on the mix of follow-on extensions of our legacy programs and a number of quality, new and exciting orders that demonstrate the long-term strength of our portfolio. And finally, on Chart 11, we have our summary. We've seen strong performance from all of our business areas this year, and I'm especially pleased with our year-to-date orders, both in quantity and quality. Our full year outlook has improved in all financial metrics, and we look forward to continued growth in 2019. With that, we're ready for your questions. John?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And first, we'll go to the line of Myles Walton with UBS.
Myles Walton: So a quick question for you, first on the margin side. So the implied mix that you're talking about, can you give us maybe quantification of how much the growth in cost versus fixed price and also maybe by segments, a bit more color on where the 10 to 50 basis points of headwind is coming from?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, thanks, Myles. I'll take that one on. I think the simplest way to understand it is we are seeing pretty much new starts in all of our business areas, and you've seen some of that in prior orders that were released. And frankly, some of that you haven't seen because some of that has occurred on some classified contracts and actually multiple business areas. So I won't be able to get into probably as much detail as you would like in that discussion, but suffice to say that that's actually causing some of that margin pressure that we're seeing going forward as well. The largest single item that is driving the margin reduction next year, though, is actually our ULA equity earnings. Those are actually going -- we expect those to be down nearly $150 million or so from this year's estimate of the equity earnings from ULA. And you should think of that as a pretty significant reduction in both the launch quantity in terms of the number of vehicles launched, but probably more importantly, a pretty significant change in the mix of those launch vehicles. So we have more, for instance, Delta IV launches in 2018 than we expect to have in 2019. Those are obviously the most profitable launch vehicles in all of ULA's portfolio.  So that's the biggest driver. But as I said, without going into all the various pieces, maybe I'll tell you what. I'll try to hit just a couple of the business areas maybe very quickly going into next year. I'll give you more detail on this, Myles, when we talk to you in January. But as far as the margins in aeronautics, we actually expect those to be fairly similar next year to what they are this year. And that kind of goes to the comment I think I made in my prepared remarks, where we actually do expect to have legacy programs, as we're calling them, have increases in margins year-over-year. But start-up activities, including by the way, I'll count the F-16 production program as a restart there. We've been out of production for some 3 years, so that's one example of where I would cite we have production I can talk about. Other programs in some of the classified, in the Skunk Works areas, the contract activity that's driving us to have kind of a flat margin going forward. Our Missiles and Fire Control margins, probably maybe slightly lower, comparable to slightly lower than it is this year. And again, the same story is within aeronautics. Legacy programs are actually expected to have margin improvement. We're actually seeing pretty good growth in our SOF GLSS contracts, higher than we expected, quite honestly. And you recall that contract brings lower margin than in the overall portfolio of Missiles and Fire Control. Probably the biggest single driver, though, at Missiles and Fire Control is a whole bunch of new starts. And you should think of those as hypersonic programs, new starts, as well as a number of other programs, including classified activity that's going on there that we've talked about orders being received previously on this call. RMS, right now, we're looking at actually pretty comparable margin going forward. So really, you should think of the first 3 business areas that I've talked about, ARRW, Missiles and Fire Control and RMS all having comparable -- maybe slightly less in Missiles and Fire Control. The biggest driver, as I said, earlier, is Space Systems or Space, and that's primarily because of the ULA equity earnings there. The rest of the portfolio is actually performing about as expected next year compared to this year.
Operator: Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays.
David Strauss: I wanted to ask a multiple-part question on F-35. It looks like F-35 in the quarter grew fairly significantly well above kind of the delivery rate growth. Can you talk about kind of how far in terms of the revenue growth we're seeing, how that breaks out between production and sustainment? Kind of how far ahead we are based on going from 91 deliveries this year to 130? And then last one, on your cost curve, obviously, the price per LRIP is coming down like 5%, 6%. Can you talk about your cost curve? What kind of learning you're seeing from a cost perspective?
Bruce Tanner: David, I'll take that one on as well. So you had a lot of parts in that question. I'm just going to try to keep up with them. Relative to revenue growth on F-35, I think what you surmise is pretty accurate. And we did have some pretty significant growth in the quarter. I think we were double-digit, actually a little more than double-digit on F-35 in the quarter. As we look, and maybe that's the heart of your question, what does that look like next year, I think, you said relative to the ramp-up from 91 to about 130 aircraft. We would expect F-35 next year to also grow probably at the double-digit, maybe a little bit higher than that. And that's for both production and sustainment activity, David. And the one wildcard that I'll mention that really did surprise me as well as we were getting ready for this call is that actually the development activity on F-35 is going to grow at double-digit rate next year. So part of that is we had a pretty significant reduction in the older SDD contract from 2017 to 2018, but we're starting to see more and more sort of new noncore SDD development activities being added to the contract. And that's actually growing, as I said earlier. That's growing, the development portfolio, higher than double-digit from 2018 to 2019, so that's kind of a pleasant surprise for us. Cost curve, I don't have the learning. Maybe Marillyn does at the top of her head. I want to say we were at the mid-80s to maybe a little bit higher percent learning curve on F-35. I think that's about right that we've been running about that level, almost since the LRIP 1, David. So we're still maintaining that. At some point in time, that will start to level out as we've kind of branched all we can out of our learning curve, and that's where we need to have some potential investments to get some sort of step improvements going forward there. But at least, right now sort of year-to-date and we're still -- or Q-to-date and we're still seeing that trend. Think of it as mid- to higher 80% learning curve is what we're experiencing on F-35. by the way, very much in line with what we've seen on other legacy production programs, if not slightly better.
Operator: The next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research.
Robert Stallard: Marillyn, I just wanted to follow up on your comments regarding those programs you've lost in the quarter and the potential $5 billion hit. Are you concerned that this is changing the landscape for defense contracting, and the sort of low ball bids could make your future profitability less attractive?
Marillyn Hewson: No, not for us. I mean, that's not the kind -- that's not what you would expect from Lockheed Martin, and that was the point in my opening remarks is that we're going to pursue good business for this company and being able to perform at what we say we can perform, too, for our customers. So that's the key for us. How other competitors behave in this environment, I really can't speak to you. You'll have to ask them.
Robert Stallard: That was more from the other direction. Is this potentially what the customers are now expecting as they see these prices out there?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, we have seen -- we've talked about this in the past call, so that -- we obviously made a clarification on what you're asking. We do see that the affordability is a very important element for them, and a lot of these best value procurements, when we know that we've got a good technology solution when it comes down to lowest cost technically acceptable -- lowest price technically acceptable, LPTA-type decision, we are seeing -- we are assuming that's happening because if you come in with a technical solution that's good and comparable, and you meet all of those elements, but then they just go for lowest price and ultimately, that could be the opportunity that the government is taking on affordability. And they cite that. We've seen in the media that they would cite that they've gotten things at much lower than they anticipated. Bruce, anything you want to add?
Bruce Tanner: The one thing I want to add, Marillyn, is -- Rob, I think I wouldn't necessarily draw a long conclusion from 3 awards. I'll tell you, those were disappointing for a lot of reasons. But the fact that they were really decided, all 3 of them, on sort of a LPTA basis didn't help the situation. It's not getting -- I would argue, the best capabilities for the warfighter in the hands of the warfighter. What else? I don't think that's entirely universal amongst all the competitions that we've seen this year. And we frankly won some competitions where we weren't the highest price. So I do know that you can automatically, as I said, draw a conclusion that, that's necessarily a change from on every program that's going to be competed going forward. So it's not a one-size-fits-all, if you will.
Operator: And our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi.
Jonathan Raviv: Bruce, some of the commentary you provided on the margin, I was wondering if you can give us some perspective on sales growth, including on some of the single aisles, which impacted 2018. How [indiscernible] what the prospect is for growth to accelerate in '19?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, so as we said, we experienced growth all throughout 2018. And we talked about that on previous calls as far as how we came out with roughly a 2% expectation, we ended up actually having 6% growth over 2017. And I think in the past, I attributed that to the significant plus-up in terms of the omnibus increases. Many -- higher rate of awards, and especially in the first half of the year than what we were expecting to have and an earlier turn-on for a lot of those awards than what was historically we've seen. This, I think, speaks to the speed concept that Secretary Mattis always talks about now, is getting things to the warfighter's hands quicker. So I think that was part of the reason we're seeing in 2018 as high as we are. 2019, I'll try to do the same, if you will. I think the highest growing business area is going to be Missiles and Fire Control. I think they're going to grow probably a little bit north of double-digit, maybe not much more than that. Next up is aeronautics, which collectively, I think, is probably going to grow probably in the high single digits, not quite the double-digit level but that's still good growth there. RMS and right now, both RMS and Space are expected to be sort of comparable to where our results were for 2018 or where they're expected to be for 2018. I think that there's a business area or two that I could point to, where there may be some opportunity to get some growth beyond that. The comparable level is probably in both of those. I think we had some potentially good news, for instance, on the Canadian Surface Combatant competition and depending on when that gets fully awarded. I won't go through the entire process. That has the potential, I think, to create some growth going forward. So I'm watching those faces, but you should think of it, Jon, as really the Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control sort of carrying the heavy load in terms of sales growth, with Space and RMS somewhat comparable expectation to where they are this year, with hopefully some upside to that level.
Operator: Next question is from Rich Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran: Bruce, I think this is going to be for you. And I'm going to ask you a bit of a forward-looking question here. And if you feel you can't answer it, just tell me and I'll ask something else. The long-term 2018 to 2020 cash from ops guide was not in the slides. So I thought I'd ask you about that. Would you comment on your 2018 to 2020 cash from operations trends? And would you care to comment on 2021? And if you can't answer it, would you include in your answer just a general discussion of major programs, about what's baked into your guidance and what's not?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Thanks, Rich. Let me figure out how to better navigate through your question there. So we've given sort of 3-year numbers in the past. We're actually going to talk about that probably more in the January call, but I'll give it a shot here as well. So in the past, we've said that we had expected about $3 billion in 2018. We're ending up at about $3.4 billion, so a pretty good beat relative to our expectations there. We still see in 2000 -- I would say, 2019 we're providing a trend information of at least $7 billion. We still see $7 billion, which we teed up in one of those charts that we briefed previously in 2020. And you should think of that, Rich, as we're actually seeing some pretty good-sized working capital growth in both 2019 and 2020 associated with a lot of our new start programs. It so happened that it happens on a time when it's sort of fortunate for us because it happens in 2 years where we don't have pension contribution, so we're kind of able to have nice, robust cash in both '19 and '20, even while we're growing working capital. The fortunate thing about 2021 is that working capital starts to actually reverse itself, so we actually start to recover a lot of the working capital growth we're actually seeing in '18, '19 and '20. And at least as we sit here today, Rich, and I'm not trying to give a 3-year guidance number for you, but I would think that the 2021 cash ought to be fairly comparable to our cash from operations in 2019 and 2020. And that's despite the fact that we start making pension contributions at a pretty good magnitude in 2021, somewhere north of $1.5 billion or so. So you should think of that as we're recovering working capital in that time frame. We're also starting to have higher depreciation recovery in terms of cash recovered versus the capital expenditure increases we've seen in the last couple of years, and we expect to see next year as well. And then lastly, the profit growth we're getting from the sales growth that we talked about earlier. So sort of those three things is what's giving us a pretty -- as we sit here today, at least, I'll say a fairly good expectation that we can hold at the $7 billion level, at least as we're looking out for the next 3 years or so.
Operator: Our next question from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein: I just want to follow up on that comment you just made about capital spending. And I guess I'm trying to just think about that as we project forward, how much does it increase and when does that increase stop? And is this new facility, that go with a lot of the wins that you've seen to-date? I mean, can you just characterize where that money is going?
Bruce Tanner: So Sam, I'll take that. It seems like I get this question every year, and every year it seems like I'm saying next year is sort of the peak of capital expenditures. And unfortunately, that's not the case now. But I would argue this is all good news. Capital expenditures next year, probably going to be $1.5 billion or more than that, slightly, so a pretty good increase from this year. At least, in our 3-year planning, the 2020 capital expenditures are actually higher than 2019. And then, they come down actually fairly dramatically in the 2021 time frame. So our free cash flow will start to look better in 2021 because of that. And most of it -- you kind of nailed it, Sam. Think of this as the continuing ramp-up of both buildings and tooling at Missiles and Fire Control to support capacity increases for weapons and air missile defense programs. So I think I've talked about in previous calls that we're seeing significant demand to increase production rates on a number of our programs, particularly the weapons but not exclusively weapons, also air missile defense. And I like to use the example of Hellfire. I think we're building similar -- I think the capacity numbers we're being asked to support, we're going to go up to like 11,000 per year or more. PAC-3, we've got a request that could potentially go up to 500 missiles per year. So we're seeing some fairly good-sized requests in terms of additional capacity. That's the good news. And the good news, I guess, also is that it takes capital to support those requirements in order to support those increases that will result in growth in the out years once that capacity comes online. So that's what's going on at Missiles and Fire Control. At Space, we're completing sort of a fairly large infrastructure support to have a brand-new sort of manufacturing facility for larger satellites that will actually result in a more efficient build of those satellites as well. And that sort of starts to finalize, I think in 2019. And then finally, we actually are seeing a ramp-up of both buildings and the tooling in those buildings at Aeronautics, primarily to support our Skunk Works or ADP programs out in the West Coast. So this is where a lot of the stuff that we can't necessarily talk about is going on. But it does take added infrastructure to support that going forward. So the three big chunks, that's the reason for the capital increases over the next couple year. Marillyn, I don't know if there anything else I left out.
Marillyn Hewson: I think you covered it, Bruce. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Douglas Harned: A question that I think -- I feel like just has to be asked right now is given the political situation with Saudi Arabia, can you give us a sense of what your backlog exposure is to Saudi and to UAE? And how are you thinking about the current political environment and the relationship with Saudi? How do you work with that with your portfolio?
Marillyn Hewson: Yes, thanks for the question, Doug. I'll just first remind you and the rest of the folks on the call that most of these agreements that we have are government to government purchases, so anything that we do has to do with following strictly the regulations of the U.S. government. In a way, that includes sales to Saudi Arabia. And we do business in more than 70 countries, so this is just the way we do business, generally speaking, is through government to government procurements. And they certainly are the ones that we've been talking about, the weapons sales we've been talking about to Saudi Arabia. We continue to make progress on the programs that we had talked about from the May of 2017 announcement way back then. For example, we announced this quarter that our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant program with Saudi Arabia has moved forward with some additional -- an additional $450 million contract for detailed planning and design for their multi-mission combatant. That was already on the contract. And then beyond that, we'll just work with the U.S. government as they're continuing their relationship with Saudi. In terms of the outlook, Bruce, do you want to take that?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, I'll take a shot at that, Doug. So I look at this. And really, we were thinking we possibly could get a question on this during the call. But we've really just had, as Marillyn said, the one significant order so far, which was for the MMSC. So think of that as a next-generation LCS, if you will, but more capable ship. The largest order that we've been waiting on obviously, is THAAD, and that has not taken place yet, not sure when that will take place. But the interesting thing about the THAAD order is while it brings a significant increase in the backlog, the resulting sales, profit and cash flow with that order are very much pushed to the right. And you should think of that, Doug, as it's because there's a dependency on the radar that has to have a technology refresh, that is actually some years out into the future. So even with the large orders, we would not have significant sales in the near term because those missiles would be arriving too soon to be supported by the actual radar that needs to be refreshed, as I said. So I think the initial operating capability in Saudi is like 2023, if I'm not mistaken. And just to give you some idea of the level, I don't have -- your question was on backlog. I don't have the exact level of backlog, but I did take a look at sales projections going forward for KSA, and I think we have in 2019 about less than $0.5 billion of sales plan. And I looked out into 2020, it's just less than $900 million of sales. So not a huge amount of dependency on the activity even though the opportunities we've described are much larger than that, obviously.
Operator: The next question is from Peter Arment with Baird.
Peter Arment: Maybe, Bruce, just following on to that. Maybe you could just update us on some of the outstanding international contracts that you're expecting maybe before the end of the year and just any levels of backlog, where you sit, that you're finishing up?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Probably not so much international orders as fourth quarter is always the quarter where we get quite a bit of domestic orders from the U.S. government. It's the first quarter of the fiscal year, and that tends to have quite a bit going on, with new funds being left there. The biggest order, obviously, by far is -- and I should have said that does include international orders as well. And there is the F-35 economic order quantity or block buy. You should think of that as about 219 aircraft comprising lots 12, 13 and 14, both for U.S. aircraft, all 3 variants, as well as a significant amount of international aircraft as well. So that's, obviously, the biggest single order. You should think of that as approaching $30.5 billion or so. We also expect to get the added FY '18 20 aircraft that came on the FY '18 appropriations in the fourth quarter as well. And then, we'll get quite a few -- I'll say the normal, as I said, first quarter, the fiscal year orders for things like the PAC-3 fiscal year '19, probably another block buy of THAAD missiles. All the normal orders have sort of come up with that fiscal year. We're looking at actually growing backlog in large part because of the -- we actually have a record backlog, as Marillyn said and as I've said, in the third quarter, but we expect that number will exceed $120 billion by the end of the year, primarily because of what we just talked about on the F-35 block buy but not obviously exclusive to that. Going forward, in the 2019, I won't go too forward into the year, but we would expect to hopefully get -- at U.S. international, we'd expect to see an F-16 Slovakia order next year. I think we have next year out of the 24 C-130s, that we expect to get probably about 11 will be international aircraft and 6 of those hopefully for Germany in that category. Let's see, what else, I'm thinking out loud. That's probably enough for right now. Like I said, a lot of the other orders in our business areas are really coming from domestic sources, like some Orion orders. We're going to get 2 -- we'll, I can't think what the E stands for. It's the flight of the Orion.
Marillyn Hewson: Exploration.
Bruce Tanner: Exploration something. We already got 2 of those orders on Orion next year, so it's a pretty good-sized order within our Space business. And again, as I've mentioned earlier, Peter, we have the potential for closing on the Canadian Surface Combatant, which is a huge program. I think that's probably the largest shipbuilding program in the world once it starts, and we will be the integrator and combat system provider for that. I think the total content potentially that comes out of that is north of $7 billion. So wouldn't expect to get that all in one fell swoop in an order in 2019, but that will be the initial start of something that large.
Operator: Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.
Rajeev Lalwani: Marillyn, I wanted to come back to you, I guess ask you another political question. There's been some discussion recently about lower defense budgets for fiscal '20. I think it's like 5% or so of the decline. How do you interpret that? And do you have any insight as to what the base that may be using to step down from? And if it is some sort of contraction, how do you think Lockheed is positioned? What are the risks and opportunities we should be thinking about?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question, Rajeev. I guess as we look at fiscal year '20, right now the President -- that future year defense program input that came out earlier this year was showing an increase -- a modest increase in FY '20 funding levels, and we'll just have to see what's actually submitted in the presidential budget. That doesn't come in until early next year. We'll wait to see. But I'll just remind you, it was very healthy in FY '18 and '19 with -- giving not only us, but our industry counterparts, a lot more visibility. And as you know, we have long-cycle business, and so we've got a lot of things in motion now as we would be looking into 2020. We're always mindful of the BCA caps because they come back into play in 2020 and 2021. And we're always [indiscernible] with our lawmakers to [indiscernible] and they need to address that. And they have been addressing that for these two year bipartisan budget cap agreements that they put in place. So hopefully, they will continue to do that because Secretary Mattis and the Trump administration have highlighted that we've got to continue to modernize our military. Now I do know that the President did come out and asked all the departments across the government to look at a reduction of 5% in their spending, and that's just a way to try to focus on affordability and reducing cost, but we'll see how they come back with DoD because they have also been very strong about the need to focus on defense spending and modernizing our military. So we'll see how that plays out. But back to my point earlier, right now we're seeing a modest increase for FY '20. Who knows, it could be even higher because of the modernization that needs to happen.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Bruce, I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about cash and working capital. And so first of all, if we think about bridging the cash from, if we thought about kind of $3.5 billion or so of operating cash flow this year and then not having to -- no pension contributions would probably get you pretty close to 7. And then, your underlying operating profit growth is probably another 200 or so after tax. And then, the working capital kind of takes that -- takes a little bit of chunk out of that. Is that, at least for your initial guidance, which I assume is probably -- you want to take account of -- be a little bit conservative. But is that kind of a -- are those the big pieces in terms of how we get from last year to -- or this year to next year?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, I think you've got it pretty well nailed, Seth. And the only thing I might throw out there is we'll get, obviously, a little bit lower tax -- cash taxes paid because of deductibility of future pension contributions that we'll be making in that time frame as well.
Operator: The next question is from Rob Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn: So a couple of questions, Bruce, for you. Just on the F-35, I know you talked about the learning curve and Marillyn did as well, but you did have this tremendous incremental margin in the quarter, best in 3 years. And if you could just talk to how that changes as that learning curve flattens, I think you were about 24%. I'm sure there were some maybe unusual things in there. But if you talk a little bit about that margin trend and how we see that going forward. And then separately, is there -- with the volatility in equity markets, is there a return on assets level or underperformance that would require return to ERISA contributions in '19 and '20?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, let me take the -- well, I'll think about your second. Let me take your first one there. So we did have some pretty good step-ups, or risk retirements as we call them, on F-35 in the quarter. You should think of that as mostly, I'll say getting to sort of an annual review of older production contracts that took place in the third quarter. So I think the step-ups we have, the biggest ones were actually on LRIP 8 and LRIP 9. And that's just sort of taking both of those programs, I think -- that's just sort of taking both of those programs from where we had booked profit up to date to sort of where we expect to be at contract closeout. And that happened to be in this quarter. And just given the size of those contracts and the size of the difference we had and where we were booking versus where we expect to be at completion, that ended up being a pretty good-sized risk requirement. Trend going forward, as I said and maybe it wasn't clear, but this is one of those legacy programs that I would think we'd have the ability to do a little bit of margin improvement, and we actually did cross the 10% ROS level in 2018 for the entire program, which we've been talking about for a long, long time that, that was sort of the year we were targeting, and we actually got there this year. I think there might be some potential for incremental improvement going forward. But I think more of the story of F-35 is just going to be the volume of the -- or sort of similar to maybe slightly improving margins going forward trend-wise, as we would characterize it. As far as the pension funding and the return on assets it could drive, I think at the 1% level, I think, Rob, that would probably drive maybe a couple of hundred million dollars of funding in the 2020 time frame. We've talked previously about having 0 contributions in both '19 and '20. I think we're now seeing probably a little bit of a required contribution in 2020, which by the way, we did not have when we first came out with the $7 billion in both of those years. So I think we'll be able to offset -- more than offset that going forward and still maintain the $7 billion we said even with the now $200 million or so of contribution.
Operator: The next question is from Joe DeNardi with Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi: Marillyn, just a question from a corporate risk standpoint. I think if we were to go back several years, the expectation was that F-35 would maybe get to 20%, 25% of total sales. It seems like it's marching higher than that. I'm just wondering at what point in terms of its contribution to revenue or earnings it would become unacceptably big just in terms of contribution to the total company?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, first of all, I don't think it growing in sales is unacceptably big to the corporation, but we like to see it continue to sell all around the world as we've said. We like to see it go the way of the F-16, which, as you know, we've sold over 4,500 aircraft around the world. And today the F-35 program of record is around 3,200, so we hope to see it to continue to grow at that level. I understand your question, though, it being a large element of the corporation. And it really is a program that has -- if you look at it, it's not a single customer and has broad-based support. It's a global product, so not only do we have the domestic customers across fleet services, but we have today with 9 international -- 8 international partners and the 3 FMS customers and many more. They're making the decision on their fighter aircraft procurements that I think they will find the best choice is the F-35, hopefully. It's going to continue to sell and it's broad-based. So even though it is a big program relatively speaking, when you consider the customer base, it's -- I think that helps mitigate the risk. In addition to that, we're seeing a lot of -- yes, as I said in my opening remarks, we're seeing a lot of growth in all elements of our business. So every business area contributed to the growth for this quarter and for our outlook for the year, and we'll continue to see growth. We've got a lot of new programs across the business, and they will help to likewise mitigate the risk of one single program. So I feel very comfortable, and I'd like to see the F-35 sales continue to grow.
Greg Gardner: Well, John, thank you very much. We're actually a little bit past the hour. With that, I'll turn it over to Marillyn for some final thoughts.
Marillyn Hewson: Sure. I'll conclude the call today. And I want to conclude just by reiterating that the corporation had another strong quarter, and we consider ourselves very well positioned to deliver growth and substantial value to our customers and our stockholders as we progress towards the successful closure of 2018 and as we look ahead into 2019. So I want to thank you all again for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in January. John, that concludes the call for today.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Greg Gardner. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our call today. We are pleased to have you joining us as we review our second quarter results, some key operational accomplishments from across our Company and celebrate a very noteworthy milestone. Before I begin I want to offer my appreciation and congratulations to our Lockheed Martin team for their continuing dedication in the achievement of strong second quarter financial results as we continue to focus the organization on long term growth and value creation. The corporation continues to deliver innovative capabilities to our customers while also returning value to our stockholders and I am very proud of our Lockheed Martin team. As today's release detailed, we have a very strong quarter and continue to develop excellent financial results – I'm sorry continue to deliver excellent financial results. And we will review these results in depth a little later on the call. I'm very pleased that our strong financial performance across the corporation and expectations for the remainder of 2018 have enabled us to increase our full year outlook for sale, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. Our second quarter and year-to-date financial performance and increased full year projection for all financial metrics are the result of the strength provided by our broad portfolio of offerings as each of our four business areas were able to contribute to our improved financial outlook. I will cover some performance highlights from our business areas in just a moment, but I want to begin by recognizing a very special milestone that occurred this quarter. June 17 marked the 75th anniversary of the founding our Skunk Works organization. In 1943, the U.S. Army expressed its urgent need for a jet fighter to counter the rapidly growing German aerial threat and Clarence Kelly Johnson and his team of dedicated engineers began the Skunk Works legacy. In just 143 days, this energetic group of aerospace innovators designed and built the XP-80 fighter aircraft helping to usher in the jet age of U.S. aviation. Over the past three quarters of a century, the Skunk Works has produced the advanced technology that leads some of the most recognizable breakthrough products in our industry including the U2 Dragon Lady spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft, the fastest plane to ever fly and the F-117 Nighthawk, the world's first stealth fighter and precursor to today's F-22 and F-35, which were also developed at the Skunk Works. The Skunk Works has become an industry standard for innovation and is a vital incubator for current technologies such as quiet supersonic flight, hypersonics, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems, and advanced unmanned aerial platforms, key providers of growth opportunities in the future. History has shown that this unique organization has the unparalleled capacity to produce new solutions to complex problems. Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works remains focused on a commitment to innovation born 75 years ago and we look forward to continuing this rich heritage for another 75 years and beyond. Turning briefly to the Department of Defense budget, you'll recall that in the first quarter Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 which raised the defense budget caps for both 2018 and 2019. Fiscal year 2019 based DoD budgets will build upon the significant growth included in the FY 2018 appropriations with an additional $17 billion on top of the greater than $70 billion dollar increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018. Both the House and Senate fiscal year 2019 appropriation bills have successfully cleared their respective committees. Once the FY 2019 Defense Appropriation Bill passes the Senate floor later this summer, the two chambers will commence the conference process. While each bill has met the total legislated target for the DoD budget caps, both committees have put forth recommended funding in excess of the original presidential budget request for a number of our programs including 12 to 16 additional F-35 jets, up to 14 additional THAAD interceptors, 8 additional C-130J aircraft, 8 to 15 Blackhawk helicopters and 1 to 2 additional Littoral Combat Ships. These increases are above the additional funding and active in the FY 2018 on the [indiscernible] appropriations of which over $7 billion [were for] [ph] Lockheed Martin programs. These FY 2019 increases will still need to be settled in conference and the agree-to-appropriations bill must be signed into law. However, we are very encouraged by the support of our portfolio has continued to receive as the budget process progresses. Moving on, I'd like to highlight several significant milestones we achieved across the corporation during the past quarter. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program. We saw four significant events take place in this quarter. In June, the United Kingdom welcomed its first four F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing jets to its shores as the U.K. prepares for its lightning force and mission operating capability by the end of this year. The STOVL aircraft will be used by both the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy and we're proud to deliver these planes as the RAF celebrates its one hundredth anniversary. Also in June, we were honored to host the roll out ceremony to mark the first two F-35 deliveries to Turkey at our Fort Worth Texas facility. Turkey has been a long standing member of the F-35 program joining in 1999 at its inception. The two F-35 jets will initially be stationed at Luke Air Force Base and will take part in a pilot training program. In May, the Israeli Air Force announced their F-35 Adir aircraft have been used in operational combat, marking the first time this fifth generation stealth fighter has been deployed into a contested environment. In this quarter, we made our three hundredth F-35 delivery as the U.S. Air Force received its latest conventional takeoff and landing variant at Hill Air Force Base. We've now delivered 305 production aircraft in total, demonstrating the program's continued progress and momentum. We anticipate delivering 91 Joint Strike Fighters in 2018 as we ramp towards full rate production. These four important milestones underscore the strong support both the U.S. forces and the international community have shown for this transformational aircraft. I'll close our aeronautics discussion by noting how pleased we were with the Slovakian Defense Ministry’s announcement this morning that they have selected our F-16 to replace its current fleet of fighters with 14 state-of-the-art block 70 aircraft planned to be ordered. The State Department has already approved the sale and we will now move to finalize the agreement which we expect will exceed $1 billion. We are excited by the opportunity to add Slovakian jets to our recent Bahrain order as we look to extend our new Greenville F-16 production line for years to come. Moving to our Missiles and Fire Control business area, we saw significant demand for our tactical missile products this quarter as well as continued support in air and missile defense. Our guided multiple launch rocket system, GMLRS team received a not-to-exceed award of approximately $820 million dollars for Lot 13 production and delivery of precision strike weapon systems for the U.S. Army. We also received an award of over $360 million for Army Tactical Missile System or ATACMS missiles. This program will allow the military system to upgrade their existing ATACMS missiles with new technology and double their range, while extending their shelf life by more than 10 years. Also in our Air and Missile Defense Organization, our PAC-3 team received a pair of awards to produce additional interceptors for the U.S. Army and foreign military sales customers with a potential value in excess of a $0.5 billion. Before moving on, I'd like to acknowledge the Tactical Missile team's successful dual test event launching a pair of long range anti-ship missiles or LRASM precision guided missile from a U.S. Air Force B-1B lancer bomber. The missiles positively identified their maritime target and delivered a successful impact. This is the second successful dual LRASM flight test as the team progresses towards early operational capability on B1B aircraft later this year demonstrating our ability to rapidly deliver crucial capabilities to our war fighters. In the Rotary and Mission Systems business area, we saw two historic achievements for CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter. In April, the CH-53K made its international debut at the ILA Berlin Air Show and flew for the first time outside of the United States. Using its modern design and fly-by-wire technology, the heavy lift 53-K demonstrated its unique capabilities. It was remarkable to see a rugged aircraft of this power and cargo weight carrying capacity exhibit such maneuverability. In May, we delivered the first of our anticipating 200 production King Stallions to the U.S. Marine corps. The helicopter now enters into the supportability test plan where the Marines will conduct logistics and maintenance evaluations to ensure readiness and support on the flight line when the CH-53K enters into service with the corps. We currently have an additional 18 aircraft in various stages of production as the program continues to mature and grow. As part of our continuing focus on affordability and our ongoing commitment to maintaining efficient operations, we made the difficult decision this quarter to eliminate certain positions and restructure part of the Rotary and Mission Systems organization which resulted in a $0.26 charge to earnings per share. The majority of this action is related to our Sikorsky line of business as we complete the integration activities we began several years ago and work to ensure the organization is properly sized to meet customer requirements and growth objectives. We believe this will benefit our customers help position the RMS business area and the corporation for improved competitiveness and create additional long term value for stockholders. I'll close with our space business area which celebrated two important milestones this quarter. In May, the fourth Space Based Infrared System or SBIRS GEO Flight-4 satellite achieved first flight as it turned on its powerful sensors for the first time and began transmitting images back to Earth. SBIRS GEO-4 is the latest satellite to join the Air Force's orbiting missile warning system and it completes the baseline SBIRS constellation providing global coverage and increased accuracy to detect an even greater number of targets. We are proud to be able to provide this key component of the nation's Air and Missile Defense System and look forward to continuing this rich legacy with the future completion of SBIRS 5 and 6 and beyond. Our space business area continued its leadership in research and space exploration with the successful launch of the Lockheed Martin designed and built NASA Mars InSight Lander. The InSight spacecraft was launched aboard a ULA Atlas V rocket this past May and is scheduled to arrive in November of this year. After its 6 months journey to the Red Planet, the InSight robotic explorer will begin its mission of studying the interior composition of the planet's core by analyzing the structure of the core and crust and measuring the rate of internal seismic activity. The data provided by this mission will help scientist better understand the geologic evolution of Mars as well as all terrestrial planets including Earth. Our corporation has built Landers for Mars research programs since NASA's first Viking mission in the 1970s and we've been a part of every NASA mission to Mars. We continue to incorporate innovative technologies and decades of experience into each new spacecraft and we are excited to continue our Mars heritage with the InSight program. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our second quarter financial performance and discuss our updated outlook for 2018. We will then open up the line for your questions.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks Marillyn and good morning, everyone. As I highlight, our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart three and an overview of our results for the quarter. In short, we exceeded our expectations for every financial metric in the quarter building upon the strong results from the first quarter. Sales and segment operating profit and cash from operations excluding our pension contribution were particularly strong. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion dollars in cash from operations before making $2 billion in contributions to our pension trust that we accelerated to preserve the 35% tax deduction as we have previously discussed. This contribution will turn cash for the quarter slightly negative however was much better than we projected when we last spoke in April. Our accelerated contributions will end next quarter as we make the final $1.5 billion of our planned $5 billion in pension outlays for the year. We returned almost $900 million dollars to our stockholders again this quarter, nearly $600 million through dividends and more than $300 million through share repurchases reducing share count by a million shares and we increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. So we're very pleased with our results for the first half of the year. On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the second quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales grew almost 7% over the same quarter last year driven by a combination of three factors. First, higher than planned win rates on new programs. Second, earlier than planned awards. And third, several unplanned awards associated with the Omnibus budget increases announced last quarter some of which are expected to convert into increased sales quicker under the new revenue recognition methodology. Missiles and Fire Control had the highest growth in the quarter at almost 17% driven by classified business, volume in our air missile defense line of business and increases in sensor and tactical missile sales. Aeronautics grew 8% in the quarter, due primarily to increased F-35 production volume while RMS grew more than 4%, due to higher volume on radar programs and a number of programs in our integrated warfare systems and sensor line of business. These increases more than offset lower volume at Sikorsky due to lower Black Hawk volume which itself was lower was partially offset by higher CH-53K volume. Space’s sales in the quarter were essentially flat compared with last year second quarter results. Segment operating profit was up almost 9% in the quarter compared with last year’s results. RMS again had the highest operating profit improvement this quarter with a 26% increase, driven by higher sales volume and improved performance across most of the portfolio including Sikorsky, where we’re seeing better performance on the Multi-Year IX contract for Black Hawk helicopters along with cost reduction activities across Sikorsky that are more than offsetting the lower billed rate volume of Multi-Year IX versus Multi-Year VIII. I’ll point out of the results for RMS exclude $96 million in severance and restructuring charges that are recognized as unallocated corporate expense in accordance with our practice for charges this large. These charges better position us to be more cost competitive both in the current market environment and going forward. Missiles and Fire Control had the next highest level of profit growth at 10% with higher volume resulting from the sales increase and improved performance across the portfolio more than offsetting a provision we established for performance on an international combat vehicle. Space grew over 7% driven by higher risk retirements in fleet ballistic missiles and lower provisions for performance in commercial satellites. Aeronautics profit grew 1% in the quarter with improved performance on F-35 production and sustainment contracts more than offsetting a significant risk retirement on the C-5 program that occurred last year. Turning to Chart 5, we’ll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS of $4.05 was $0.77 higher than our results last year, driven by the higher segment operating profit results and a lower tax rate in the quarter compared with last year. The $4.05 EPS in the quarter includes the $0.26 charge for severance and restructuring activity that I mentioned earlier. On Chart 6, we provide a revised outlook for the year. We are increasing our outlook for sales by $1.25 billion and our segment operating profit outlook by $260 million as a result of the strong performance in the first half of the year and our expectations that we will continue to see strong performance in the second half as well. We’re also increasing our EPS and cash from operations outlooks and will discuss each of those increases in the next few charts. Chart 7 provides our sales guidance by business area for the year. We’re increasing our sales outlook for all four business areas with RMS representing the largest increase at $400 million, Space next with a $350 million increase and both Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control increasing by $250 million each to account for the $1.25 billion increase overall. Chart 8 shows our new segment – excuse me, our new outlook for segment operating profit by business area for the year. We are increasing our segment operating profit outlook by $260 million with RMS also having the largest profit increase among the business areas at $120 million, Missiles and Fire Control next with an $80 million increase, and space and Aeronautics increasing $35 million and $25 million respectively. Chart 9 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook for the year. Our segment operating profit improvement drives a $0.72 increase in our EPS. The severance and restructuring charge mentioned earlier reduces EPS by $0.26 and a lower projected tax rate along with several miscellaneous impacts improved our EPS by $0.49 with most of that change resulting from expectations of a lower tax rate in 2018 as we continue to incorporate refinements and implementing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation enacted last year. Chart 10 provides an update to our long term cash from operations outlook. Given the increase in our outlook for 2018 cash from operations, we now see our updated three year cash goal to be equal to or greater than $17.3 billion with the increase in 2018 representing an overall increase in our three year expectations rather than a pull forward from future years. And finally on chart 11, we have our summary. We’ve had a very strong first half of 2018 allowing us to increase our outlook for all key financial measures for the full-year. And as a reminder, we’ll be providing our trend information for 2019 during the upcoming October call. With that we're ready for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Bruce Tanner: Carter, are you there, you’re mute.
Carter Copeland: I am indeed on mute. Thank you very much. Good morning and good results guys.
Bruce Tanner: Thank you.
Carter Copeland: Just I wonder if you could give a little bit more color Bruce on the charge in MFC on the warrior capability sustainment just, what were you encountered there and in the ring fencing of that anything you can tell us about that to just keep in mind?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. Thanks for the comments and the question, Carter. So we’ve been working on the Warriors is the Warrior capability sustainment program and essentially it’s taking a legacy armored combat vehicle putting a new turret on it some new electronics, some new cannon essentially for our intents and purposes coming up with a new combat vehicle. And it is – as a fairly significant amount of developmental effort on it to make sure that turret operates well, make sure the cannon fires at speed and the like. So it had some issues obviously with the development aspects of this. We think we have that quantified as a result of this charge. There’s a follow-on production effort that results from this development contract to essentially modify a number of these vehicles in the service for the U.K. Army and that’s the expectation Carter is that this will come to satisfactory conclusion on the development side and will move into production and hopefully put this behind us.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Yeah, thanks. Good morning Marillyn and Bruce. Hey Bruce, maybe just given the higher sales guidance if you could be, is there any way to bracket it that you view that you said higher win rates in earlier planned wins, so how do we think of that in the context of when you’re going to give that 2019 trend information in terms of the sales profile? Is there this a pull forward or is just the timing of the awards? Any color there would to helpful.
Bruce Tanner: Look I think as I said in the in the prepared remarks, we’ve had more success from a win rates perspective and you should think of us we always sort of go into the year with sort of high expectations for ourselves but you don’t win every single competition out there, but we probably win I don’t know 65%, 70% of the competitions we enter thinking we’re going to win most of them, and that’s typically the case. Here we’ve actually experienced a higher rate than that particularly in Missiles and Fire Control but not exclusively Missile and Fire Control. And as I said in the remarks earlier, some of those awards we’ve gotten into the point where the habit perhaps of just expecting things to get delayed for things like protests and the like and we haven’t seen that happen to delay award recognition as much as maybe we’ve had seen as historically as well. So those two are both goodness those two are both a little bit of increase for the year, but also increase in future years if you think about higher win rate. And then the Omnibus activities in the awards we’re receiving here, I mean the surprise is maybe how much of that is already getting put under contract for 2018 and resulting in the sales recognition that we talked about earlier and this is again because of the revenue recognition methodology essentially recognize and as we starting incurring cost. But that’s almost pure upper to our expectations for the out years, so my expectation Peter would be this is not a pull forward, this is an upper for both to 2018 and future years as well.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: Hey, good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Rob.
Robert Spingarn: I wanted to ask you about aeronautics margins and the implied guidance remain fairly steady I guess in around 10.6 for the remainder of the year. But you look to be making good progress toward a definitized contract on LRIP 11. So what I was wondering is, is it possible that contract once it’s done generates some positive EACs there’s upside to the back end of the year in Aeronautics on F-35 or does it not actually impact the booking rate?
Bruce Tanner: Rob, I’ll take a shot at that and Marillyn can jump in the some comments if she has some. So I think we are making progress, you’re probably seen some of the press that came out on LRIP 11 there. I think we’re in the final throws of that if you will. I wouldn’t expect LRIP 11 to have huge consequential impacts from a margin perspective on the rest of 2018 quite honestly, primarily because it’s not the bulk of the activity if you will in 2018 previous contracts are the bulk and we typically have most of our risk retirements and step ups associated sort of contracts I’ll say further along than we expect to be on LRIP 11 throughout the rest of 2018. We do expect the continued good performance on the rest of the F-35 portfolio and we’re optimistic or at least we’re hopeful that there’s an opportunity to continue to see that kind of performance in the second half of the year but we’re not counting on it at this point, Rob.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joseph DeNardi: Yeah. Thanks very much. Bruce, just on the guidance increase, you took this year’s cash from ops guidance but left 2019 and 2020 at the same. Can you just speak to why that is? Thank you.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, so Joe, hopefully it’s a simple answer to the question. We just haven’t updated our planning information for 2019 and 2020. And the only reason that we increase the three year total is because of what happened 2018 obviously the $300 million increase. So similar to the question that Peter was asking relative there is the positive impact we’re seeing in 2018 translate into 2019 and beyond that. And I think the answer to that is yes. And I hope to give you inside into at least the 2019 portion of that when we talk in the October call to give trend information there but my expectation is a lot of the goodness we’re seeing in 2018 for the rest of this year is going to continue to translate into 2019 and beyond.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: Hi, Bruce, good morning. Just want to follow-up on that point. I think previously you talked about on the growth side as well 4% to 5% 2019 and 2020, just sort of put a button on this, where do expect acceleration beyond 2018 to speak from everything you’re seeing in terms of win rates and budget because I think this year you are already kind of in that range now?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, Jon, the question is, do we expect an increase over the sort of the increases that we’ve previously talked about for years 2019 and 2020. The answer is yes. And again my only hesitation of telling you that is that I don’t quite yet have the quantification of that but my expectation based on everything we’ve seen through this year and everything we expect to happen going forward is that those numbers will be higher than what we’ve talked about in the past. And again I’ll give you more inside into that hopefully quite a bit of inside into that in October.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Sam.
Sam Pearlstein: I was wondering if you could just address something quickly which is you mentioned a lower tax rate is only if you could just say what the tax you expect for this year? And then secondly in the Rotary and Mission Systems, if I just look at the overall guidance even with the higher sales and profit for this year would imply the second half margin has to come down pretty materially from the first half, so something unusual about the first half, is there a change in mix, can you just help us understand what’s happening in the second half there?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. I think that one as well Sam. And so tax rate in 2018 you should probably think of mid-14ish kind of level is what we’re out looking for the rest of the year 218. That’s probably a little bit lower than what you just expect us to do going forward say in the years 2019 and 2020. There’s sort of some onetime adjustments. I’ll give you one example, one of the adjustments where the update the deferred tax asset write down that occurred in 2017 just some true up to that that actually got reflected in our 2018 tax expense that we would not expect to carry over into 2019 and beyond. So again this year, think about mid-14s probably a little higher than that as we go forward into 2019 and 2020. On the RMS side, you’re right, I mean the math would say that we are going to come down some of that [Technical Difficulty] I think that reflects, we’ve had some really, really strong performance in the first half of the year and a lot of risk retirements pretty much across the entire portfolio as I talked about in my prepared remarks for RMS, I mean virtually every line of business, plus we’re very pleased with what’s happened in Sikorsky for the first half of the year. And I think Sam it’s just a question of whether or not we can sort of replicate the higher than I’ll say expected level of risk retirements that occurred in the first half and the second half. And at least as we’re planning right now, we don’t see the same level of planned risk retirements going forward as what we experienced in the in the first half, but we’re optimistic that we’ll continue to try to improve up on that just as we did in the first half of the year, so watch the space.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug Harned: Thank you. I wanted to go back to F-35, and two things. One is, you know now that your peers getting close on LRIP 11 looking toward a block buy. Can you talk about given the pressure coming from the customer on pricing, how are you looking at margins going forward, how should we think of that trajectory over the next few years? And then second, just the point on Turkey, there was an agreement in Congress yesterday I don’t know where this is going to go and blocking the delivery to Turkey. What would a block on the Turkish deliveries? What effect could that have on the supply chain in your delivery rates?
Bruce Tanner: So, I’ll park the first and maybe a little bit of a second one and I probably turn that over a little bit to Marillyn on the second question. So LRIP 11, as we talked about on previous questions, I think we’re in the final close of that and that hopefully sets the stage for as you indicated the next big accomplishment on F-35 which is to get the block buy sort of in place. This would be a combination of think of it as combining our supply chain buys for LRIPs 12, 13 and 14 all in one sort of a hence the name block buy deal to get cost savings associated with that aggregated demand. Doug, I think to your question, we’ve seen good performance on the F-35. I’ve talked about the fact that we do expect to see sequential improvement on F-35 margins going forward, that be probably not at the same rate as a few years past, you know there were a couple years there were at least I had said that we were expecting a 100 basis points improvement year-over-year. Don’t see those sorts of improvements but that expectation is that we still will see improvements on F-35 going forward. And I’ll say this LRIP 11 deal doesn’t change that trajectory or our expectation of those margins going forward. As to the Turkish deliveries and supply chain implications, we’re delivering, we would expect to continue to deliver Turkish aircraft as with essentially every international procurer of F-35 is the initial deliveries of F-35 is actually stay in the continental United States for training purposes. So the international pilots typically stay in the United States to get a level of proficiency to be able to fly the aircraft before they’re sort of shipped overseas. So we’ve got some time before those aircraft would leave the U.S. and go in country. That is normal standard practice for every international buy. And I guess my expectations would be we continue to deliver those and continue deliver those into our U.S. bases for training purposes. This is a contract that obviously this is one that we have the agreement. This is under the FMS the foreign military sales arrange but this is a contract between Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government as opposed to direct commercial sales, so we’ll continue to deliver air craft until the U.S. government says don’t deliver those aircraft which we’re not expecting.
Marillyn Hewson: So on supply chain front, I will address that. As we manage our supply chain, we do have parts and components being produced all around the world, so we’re always looking at international dynamics of that. The most recent discussion that you’re hearing on Turkey, we’ve been looking at that and been in discussions with the most senior levels of the Pentagon. We understand what impact that would be on the supply chain. And so we’ll book comply as Bruce said and support the U.S. government and comply to any official guidance that we get going forward. But if we look at the program itself, I mean it’s got some range of time before we actually have some action and frankly with the vast Department of Defense to do is come back with a plan in 90 days. So we see what that plan is going forward and will continue to be in close dialogue with the U.S. government.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Marillyn, Bruce, Greg, good morning. How are you?
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Richard Safran: So I have a bit of a multipart question here related to F-35 modernization. You recently awarded the Distributed Aperture System to Raytheon, you took away from Northrop, Elbit won the display taking it away from L-3 not too long ago. I want to know if you could discuss how you’re thinking about further upgrade to the F-35. How much more of the airplane might be replaced and up for bid. Do the changes you’re making just come in one future version of the airplane or is it expected that you’ll retrofit the fleet over time? And finally, since it appears that these are both capability and cost improvements, just wondering if we should expect Lockheed to capture at least part of that cost improvement in our margins?
Marillyn Hewson: That’s a multifaceted question, Rich, thanks very much for the question. I’ll start and then Bruce can fill in as well and how we see that for the longer term. But basically this is our job as managing the program itself and so we reached a point along the way of gotten through now flight test program, we are now more mature and technically mature aircraft program. And as we go to look at the next lot of aircraft, we look at having competitions for best value on components that we can do. And so some of those you sided with the distributed system and then displayed and others are just a normal course on a production program that we’ll look at and we’ll continue to do that. As we look overtime, just like any other program we will constantly be looking at continuous improvement of the program and that will open up some opportunities for additional development. But I think that answers that. Bruce you might want to address the cost side of it.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. So Rich, I think another part of your question was retrofit fleet, so incorporated this. That’s not our call that’s obviously the JPOs call is to why not they want to do that. If you’re asking my expectation, I’d say I wouldn’t expect a near term retrofit at all. My guess would be we’d go downstream and see if there is a chance to do other modifications to it to the aircraft and do this in combination with other modifications as opposed to sort of start replacing the existing aircraft with this new or this new processor and our processor in the display system. So probably more in the normal course of business as opposed to a full blown retrofit is sort of the way I’d characterize it. And I think your last question was capability to increase margins associated with this and we just say I think your premise is right. We do expect these changes to be lower costs, lower sustainment cost importantly going forward, so this is sort of a double benefit, it lowers the production cost of the aircraft, it also lowers the sustainment cost to keep those aircraft flying. We’re banking on that Rick and you should think of as we’re pricing it under those assumptions. So we wouldn’t expect to have sort of pop in margin associated with this activity because we’re pricing it out of the expectation that the benefits that we expect to see will impact the crew in this case to the U.S. government.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. So your backlog at mid-year is relatively in line with where it was at year-end. Can you give us a range as to where you expect it might be by the end of this year and some color on the foreign sales opportunities included there?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, Cai. I will take a poke at that. You’re right where [Technical Difficulty] $5 billion or about $105 billion now. We would expect to be north of that maybe between $7 million to $10 million – excuse billion dollars some of that obviously depended on some of the second half of the year awards. The big chunk of that that we are expecting a large third quarter from an order perspective the largest piece of that is obviously for the F-35 block buy. You should think of that is I don’t know exactly what that is somewhere in the $11-ish billion plus range. So that’s a very significant single order that we are expecting in the second half of the year. We also have some awards for things like that for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we have a couple of competitions obviously with the trainer replacement for the Air Force and MQ-25 for the Navy. So some of those competitions could obviously swing backlog between now and the new year obviously depending on whether or not we’re success or the size of the initial award. But in any event we would expect to see as probably north of $110 billion as we get to year-end.
Cai von Rumohr: Great. Thank you very much.
Bruce Tanner: Thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hey, Ron.
Ron Epstein: This is a question for maybe both of you guys. When you look at the U.K. recent announcement of the sixth generation fighter program concept whatever you call the tempest program? And that kind of more recently Airbus is moved to say, hey what maybe we should join forces on a fighter and have a pan-European sixth generation fighter. When you think a little bit longer term about the target market maybe beyond F-35, I mean how does that impact you guys and I mean how do we think about sixth gen fighter in Lockheed?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, I just came from Riyadh and Farnborough where that announcement was made by the U.K. about the new Tempest fighter program and I had a chance to talk to some of the senior leadership in the Royal Air Force about it. You the comments to me where that, yes this is a new fighter program that they are focused on but it is to complement the F-35. So we don’t see it as a replacement for the F-35, I mean it’s going to take some time to do a development program beyond that. And so any additional investment that they make of course that’s good for the engineering base for innovation in an aerospace and defense industry and we’re in discussions with them and trying to learn more about how we can help and supporting what their plans are in the U.K. Just as you might have hear they say that they’d like to participate in that. I think we bring as I highlight in my earlier remarks some just tremendous capability from innovation standpoint particularly out of some Skunk Works organization and we’re looking forward to that. The U.K. is solid with the F-35. I mean they were original investors putting $2 billion up front in the development phase. Today they’ve gone 15 jets and they’re still on their path for the 138 program of the record that they’re going to buy. So I don’t see an impact on the F-35 going forward, it brings a lot of transformational capabilities. My understanding from them is that they just see it as continuing to keep their engineering based focused on the next design just the U.S. government will do as we look at concepts that we might put forward on the sixth generation fighter. Anything Bruce you want to add?
Bruce Tanner: You know I might add Marillyn is I think as Marillyn said I think this is complimentary to the F-35 and also sort of that I guess the typhoon that we said on replacement. And I think into large extent this is healthy to have our allies developing capabilities that actually we can actually potentially partner with and share those capabilities cross across the ocean so to speak on future opportunities. So this is a positive that the industries of our partner countries that are allied participants are staying in the game with next generation innovations, so those are the positive thing.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, good morning. Marillyn and Bruce. Great quarter.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Thank you.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: A bit of a less exciting question, I was wondering if you could touch upon pension and some of the longer term drivers, is there any way to have quantified pension contributions and cap recoveries in 2021 and beyond?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, Sheila, I will take one. So I hope I’ll get a little better inside into that in the October call, we’ll have been close obviously by the October call will be what ten almost through ten months of the year from a return perspective on our assets, so we’ll have a better indication of what that looks like versus through the first half of the year what I said here today. As far the biggest driver relative to influencing contributions going forward, again just maybe parrot what I’ve said previously, you should think of essentially zero contributions in 2019, minimal contribution in 2020s is really associate with some of the legacy represented workforce defined benefits plan. We start making contributions in 2021. I hesitate to give a number right now only because I don’t know where we’re going to be at the end of this year relative to asset returns. There’s less sensitivity on the cash side, so sort of the billing side if you will and the recovery of cash not the outlay of cash and you should think of that is being fairly close to where we are today. I think we’re at around $2.4 billion of cash today. That number stays fairly consistent almost without regard to what happens over the next few years. So when you start looking at 2021 and 2022, it’s still about that level maybe $100 million or $200 million plus or minus either way there. But that’s sort of the level you should think about it. So cash pretty consistent, fairs I’ll give you more inside in October once we have a better idea where we’re going to end the year from an asset return perspective.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. That was actually related to the question that I wanted to ask also about pension. Bruce, could you talk a little bit so we can kind of understand conceptually, when you freeze the plan in 2020, is there or is there any more cash, like is pension still allowable costs for you guys is the whatever 401-K matching contributions you make, are those kind of cash or whatever your cash balance that you do receive from the government is at the time you freeze the plan, you just take that in over the next four or five years and then cash kind of goes to zero? And then maybe on the flip side, the contribution side of that, how should we think about what happens when the plan is pros and it gets to be fully funded?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, so good question Seth. So just to repeat what you said, so we do a full freeze on our defined benefit pension plan in 2020. You asked a question, if I understood the question, you asked does that change the liability of recovery of our defined benefit pension contribution and the answer is no. Those cash cost will continue, back to Sheila’s question that they go beyond the freeze if you will of the defined benefit pension plan, but they start to get much smaller particularly as I’m thinking out loud here particularly about the 2025 and later time periods. And think of this is essentially the recovery of a lot of the prepayment credits that we end the year with every year that we disclosed in our 10-Qs and I know I have talked a number of you about that. So somehow that those prepayment credits need to get billed and recovered by Lockheed Martin and those extend beyond the date of the pension freeze. We do have other defined contribution benefits and those are liable just as any other liable cost is in the cost accounting standard regulation. So sort of no change there going forward. We will recover both from a liable perspective a liability perspective both the remaining defined benefit, pension contributions and new any new defined contribution plan contributions. So we would think – I think another question that you have was sort of the outlays from the contributions when fully funded, perhaps and it’s still going to take a while to get fully funded. So I think the last I looked it’s still sort of post 2025. I think I said in the past we still expect to have cash recoveries associated with our pension plan in excess of our outlays every single year just about as far out as we can look until we do get fully funded. So I’ll stop there.
Operator: And we have a question from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Goldman Sachs: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: Bruce, you have been saying pretty late into May I think that what the company say in the 2018 budget would be pretty unlikely to impact 2018 and was in 2019, 2020 event or maybe even beyond 2020 given the long cycle nature a lot of the business, but you’ve now raise the revenue guidance pretty significantly relative to sizes of other raises you had in the past. And I could I guess I could see if that was happening in something like tactical missiles that can be shorter cycle but it’s super broad based, it’s almost like perfectly we split across the business. So something is evolving like fairly rapidly would seem. I know you mentioned the win rate in the faster awards, but I was hoping you could put a little more meat on the bone there maybe even I don’t know if you could give a few precise program examples, just super curious what was able to change that quickly across the business?
Bruce Tanner: So, I’m not sure how satisfying this is going to be Noah, but I mean I’ll just reiterate what I said on the prepared remarks. But when you go through at least the way we do planning, we have expectations for how many awards we’re going to win in a year. We sometimes while we think we have – what we think we got to win every reward frankly, we know that’s not realistic. So we kind of put some cushion if you will into our planning purposes for losses that we may or may not – have a good indication of where those losses might occur. And we also try to face the timing of when awards will occur in the year. And as I said earlier, we’ve had just a tremendous across the board a year from an orders perspective so far in the first half of the year. And maybe what’s – maybe not as obvious as I think it maybe it is when you get unexpected awards or higher than planned awards in the first half, on the first part of the year, those have more opportunity to translate into sales under the new revenue recognition methodology, then say an unexpected award you receive in November or December maybe just to state the obvious there. So the fact that we had higher win rates in the first half of the year on some fairly good sized programs, some in the classified arena, but pretty much across the board. As I said this is a very broad and diversified set of opportunities that we’ve won here. So that’s part of it. And then the other part like I said is we got or we received not just the competitive orders but also a number of sole source orders earlier than we had planned in our planning. So all those times when I was talking to you at the beginning of the year I was just simply referencing this is what our plan looks like and both of these came in either higher than or quicker than we expected or in some cases both of them, we put that plan together. The Omnibus budget that we talked about and by the way that happened all since of the beginning of the year. That was as I said earlier in the last call that added $7.5 billion of potential orders. And we’re expecting I looked at this data just here, they were expecting the great bulk of that to be placed under contract in 2018. And probably surprise to me as some of that is already under contract today or we’ve been awarded that in the form of long lead funding or UCA funding and that is translating into sales as we speak. So we’re potentially saying several hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue associated with Omnibus funding that was never ever envision as we starter 2018. And back to the earlier question on, does this translate or carry into the future years. The answer is absolutely yes.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes, I was wondering if you could tell us how many more years of growth the F-35 program has? And then also do you still believe you can ultimately get to the mature margins as you’ve seen on programs like the F-16? And if so how much in the future? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: I’ll take and Marillyn can add some color to that as well. So we’ve had this question asked quite a few time as far as the years of growth. I mean you kind of point to what is the current point of record. And I think the current plan of record for the F-35 shows every single year deliveries increased at least out through 2023 and that about as far out as the planning goes. I’ll tell you and I just look at this the other day, we actually have tooling capacity for more than the current plan of records maximum delivery rate. So assuming we’ve got more order, more international customer or increases on domestic orders, there is still some opportunity beyond the current planned peak production rate. And the George, I think there is ongoing – the question maybe was how long do we stay at sort of that peak volume, I don’t the answer to that question but if I go back and look at F-16 as maybe an example of what could happen. We were probably at peak production on F-16 for 7 or 10 years. And the thing that F-35 has and the F-16 never had for us is the potential for an increased sustainment activity that we would expect to grow even beyond sort of peak production level. So I think we still got quite a ways to go before see peak F-35 and that doesn’t include potential retrofit and modernization programs on the F-35 as we see with every production aircraft. So we’re not there yet. Now I hope we never see that honestly, but we’re still years away from it and if and when we do see that. And as far as the margin, I still think there is upside as I said previous George, I still think as I said probably adding some item from day one is probably, there is no reason the F-35 shouldn’t look like every other production aircraft in our history would be at F-16 or C-130s or others where you have mixed domestic content and international content. And if and when we get the ability to see this aircraft on a direct commercial sales basis, the margin approximate what they look like on F-16 programs for incidence back in that timeframe. We’re still probably years away from that but even having said that I still think there is incremental improvement at the current margin level for at least the next couple of years.
Greg Gardner: This is Greg. I think we’ve come up on the top of the hour here, so I’ll turn it back to Marillyn for some final thoughts.
Marillyn Hewson: Okay, thank you, Greg. I just want to end by reiterating that we had a strong quarter and year-to-date performance and we continue to produce outstanding results and position the corporation deliver long term value to our customer and our stockholders. So thanks again for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking you on our next earnings call in October. That concludes our call.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our call today. We are pleased to have you joining us as we review our first quarter results and some key operational accomplishments from across our Company. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our team for their high level of performance as we continue to focus the organization on long-term growth and value creation. The corporation continues to deliver critical solutions and products to our customers while also returning value to our stockholders and I’m extraordinarily proud of our Lockheed Martin team. As today’s release details, we had a very strong quarter, operationally and financially. We will review the results in-depth a little later on the call. I’m very pleased that our strong year-to-date financial performance across all business areas and our expectations for the remainder of 2018 have enabled us to increase our full-year outlook for sales, operating profit and earnings per share. Our financial results and increased outlook reflect the outstanding execution across our four business segments and the strength provided by our broad portfolio of products and services. I will cover some performance highlights from our business areas in a just moment. But, first, I want to recognize, one significant operational milestone that was retained this month. Our F-35 team celebrated the conclusion of the System Design and Development phase or SDD flight test program, fulfilling the final requirements at Naval air station, Patuxent River. Since the inception of this test program over eleven years ago, F-35 aircraft have successfully completed over 9,200 test sorties, totaling over 17,000 flight hours and satisfied over 65,000 test points, marking the conclusion of the most comprehensive complex and rigorous developmental flight test program in the aviation history. I would like to thank the entire F-35 enterprise including industry and government teams for their dedication and diligence as this unrivalled stealth fighter jet progressive on to its next chapter. Turning to the Department of Defense budget, we were very pleased to see Congress enact the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2018 providing much needed funding for our nation's military and national security. Notably the 2018 Appropriations Act raised DOD based budget funding to $600 billion over 14% above 2017 level representing the largest year-to-year increase in base budget funding for the Department of Defense in 15 years. When coupled with the overseas contingency operations funding the total amount appropriated for defense activities rose to $665 billion, included in this increase was a recognition of the need to significantly recapitalize our nation's forces with the investment accounts appropriated at levels over 20% greater than the previous fiscal year. Lockheed Martin programs were especially well supported in the budget markup, with the legislation including increased funding for 20 additional F-35 fighter jets, 17 additional C-130J transport aircraft, 16 additional Blackhawk and Seahawk helicopters, two CH-53 K helicopters and increases in multiple missile production programs as well as our Orion contract. All told key Lockheed Martin programs representing all four of our business areas received over $7 billion of appropriations above the fiscal year 2018 budget request, a clear sign of the strong support our broad portfolio has garnered from the customer community. I'll close my budget discussion with a look ahead to fiscal year 2019. In February Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and raised the defense budget caps in both 2018 and 2019. We were very pleased to see appropriations enacted to support the 2018 increase in base budget funding. We are encouraged by these legislative actions that provide our military with the resources needed to enable them to fulfill their crucial mission and we are hopeful that the fiscal year 2019 funding process will follow the same positive path in the coming months. Before addressing our business area highlights for this quarter I would like to provide you a brief update on activities relating to our opportunities in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Just this month I had the honor of hosting his Royal Highness, Mohammad Bin Salman the crown prince of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at our Sunnyvale, California location. During his visit his Royal Highness was able to see firsthand the innovative satellite technology being incorporated into two new satellites which Lockheed Martin is building to provide enhanced telecommunications capabilities in Saudi Arabia. As part of this historic tour the crown prince also saw some of our air and missile defense product line including key elements of our THAD system an important component of the joint global security announcement the U.S. and Saudi Arabia made last May. We remain in discussions on several opportunities with the kingdom and in March we were awarded a contract for nearly $500 million to fund long lead activities for construction of four multi mission service combatant ships a key element in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia's defensive strategy. We look forward to continuing our more than 50 year partnership with the kingdom to help them provide for the security of their citizens and support to his Royal Highness's Saudi vision 2030 is a blueprint for transformation of their country. Moving on I would like to highlight several operational milestones we achieved across the corporation during the recent few months. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program, during the first quarter, I was proud to represent our cooperation at the Korea roll out ceremony at our manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The Republic of Korea and the U.S. government leaders celebrated the public debut of the first F-35 produced for the Republic of Korea Air Force. The ceremony was attended by over 450 guests and represented a major program milestone as the Korean Air Force took delivery of the first aircraft in its 40 jet plane of record, five more will follow this year. As our production line continues to ramp up and we progress on our 2018 goal of delivering more than 90 aircraft to our U.S. and international customers. Keeping with our aeronautics business area, this quarter our aero team celebrated the delivery of the 400 C-130J Super Hercules as the air force special operations command received its latest Commando II special ops model of the vulnerable C-130J platform. The hallmark of the C-130J is its versatility and this aircraft supports 17 different mission configurations including this Special Forces version. The performance of this remarkable plane has drawn global demand with operators in 17 countries. And C-130J have passed over 1.7 million flight hours supporting the varied missions. The C-130J has proven to be the tactical airlift platform of choice and we look forward to continue our global leadership in air mobility for decades to come. Thirdly, NASA awarded our aeronautics organization and new contract to design, build in flight test, a low-boom flight demonstrator. A new supersonic X-plane, but despite flying an excessive of the speed of sound, we will produce a sonic boom that will not be disruptive to the general public. Because of noise restrictions over land air travel above Mach 1, which creates the sonic boom is currently not allowed. This program will build on the preliminary design we started several years ago under NASA’s quiet supersonic technology effort. The new demonstrator aircraft will be built in our Skunk Works facility and we look forward to its first flight in just a few years with the goal of making quiet supersonic passenger air travel of reality. Moving to our Missiles and Fire Control business area, we saw continued demand for our air and missile defense products. Our THAAD team received an award of approximately $460 million for the production and delivery of additional interceptors and engineering support bringing the contract value of our lot 10 program to over $1.2 billion. We also received an award of over $500 million as the U.S. and international customers look to upgrade their missile defense capabilities using our PAC-3 and PAC-3 missile segment enhancement or MSE, interceptors, lot kits, spares and support equipment. Also U.S. and Polish officials signing agreement for Poland to become the fifth international PAC-3 MSE customer. The advanced capabilities provided by our PAC-3 MSE interceptors will support the WISLA Air and Missile Defense system intended to protect Poland’s armed forces, citizens and infrastructure and we're honored to have this opportunity. Before I leave Missiles and Fire Control, I would like to commend the tactical missile team for the successful operational debut of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile JASSM, during a recent allied strikes against Syrian chemical weapons research and storage facilities. A total of 19 JASSM stealth cruise missiles were launched marking their first use in combat and these weapons performed their missions with precision, contributing to the success of the multinational operation. In the Rotary and Missions systems business area, the U.S navy awarded us a unique contract to develop, manufacture and deliver to high-powered laser weapons systems to eventually be field with the board surface ships. This program the HELIOS contract is initial worth $150 million. However, with options it could increased to nearly $950 million. This weapon system is the first of its kind and combines laser technology, traditional sensor and systems and counter unmanned aerial system capabilities designed to help provide layered defense support. This award is a result of our commitment to advancing technology with more than 40 years experience in this domain, including long-standing internal research and development projects as well as customers funded contracts. We are honored to be working with the navy on this program and we are excited by the opportunity this leading edge system brings. I will close with our space business area, celebrated the successful launch of two upgraded Trident II D5 missiles, certifying the readiness of the crew and the operational performance of the strategic weapon system. The two missiles were launched from the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Nebraska. And marked the 166th and 167th successful test launches since design completion in 1989, the most reliable test record for any ballistic missile of its kind. This modernize Trident missile, will be in service with U.S Navy and United Kingdom royal navy for next two decades adding to our over 60 year heritage of support to the sea leg of the Nuclear Triad. I would like to congratulate our space organization on this significant milestone and for their long history of mission success. I will now turn the call over to Bruce to review our first quarter financial performance and to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2018. We will then open up the line for your questions.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks Marillyn and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let’s begin with chart three and an overview of our results for the quarter. It’s been a very strong start to the year, sales and segment operating profit were both higher than our expectations for the quarter, while cash was in line with our expectations given the planned pension contribution we made this quarter. We returned almost $900 million to our stockholders in the quarter nearly $600 million through dividends and about $300 million in share repurchases. Based on these results, we have increased our outlook for sales, operating profit and earnings per share for the year. On Chart Four, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about 4% higher this quarter compared with last year with three of our four business areas showing growth in the quarter. Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control both experience high single-digit growth in the quarter. Aeronautics was driven primarily by F-35 production volume, while Missiles and Fire Control was driven by tactical missiles and classified programs volume. Rotary and Mission systems had double-digit growth in three of its lines of business and was partially offset by lower volume Sikorsky due to lower qualities on our government helicopter programs. As expected space was slightly lower than last year as a result of our continuing cost reduction efforts on follow-on buys of our large government satellite programs. Segment operating profit was up considerably in the quarter compared with last year's results. RMS had the highest operating profit improvement driven by the absence of the charge taken last year, for the EADGE-T program as well as strong performance across the entire portfolio led by improved performance at Sikorsky. Aeronautics and missiles of fire control increased due to higher sales volume and improved performance, while space was lower due to the lower sales volume and risk retirements in the quarter. Turning to Chart Five, we will discuss our earnings-per-share in the quarter. Our EPS of $4.02 was 50% higher than our results last year, driven by the higher segment operating profit results that I just discussed as one of the lower tax rate in the quarter as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted in December. On Chart Six, we show the impact of our plan pension contribution, so have on our cash from operations profile in 2018. Cash in the first quarter was significantly lower than last year as a results of contributing $1.5 billion to our pension trust this year versus none last year. And with an additional $3.5 billion of contribution planned for the end of the third quarter, we expect cash from operations in the next two quarters to be much lower than our historical results. In fact, we could see negative cash from operations in the second quarter, given the plan level of contributions in that quarter, because of these contributions we expect our cash generation to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, all-in-all though we remain comfortable with our outlook of greater than or equal to $3 million in cash from operations for the year. Chart Seven provides our updated guidance for the year. We are increasing our sales outlook by $350 million based on higher expectations for Aeronautics, MFC and space for the rest of this year. We are increasing our segment operating profit outlook by $115 million due to higher sales volume and improved performance and Aeronautics, MFC and RMFs. There is no change to our other unallocated expense, or our Net FAS adjustments. We are increasing our earnings per share by $0.60. I will provide more detail into this increase on the next chart. And we are leaving our cash from operations outlook unchanged to greater than or equal to $3 billion. Chart Eight, provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings-per-share outlook for the year. Our segment operating profit improvement drives a $0.32 increase in our EPS, updated to our revised estimated effective tax rate for the year and some other miscellaneous changes drives $0.28 increase in EPS, resulting in a total increase of $0.60 than a new EPS range of $15.80 to $16.10. On Chart Nine, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. We increased our sales outlook in three of our business areas an increase of $150 million in space, $125 million in Aeronautics, and $75 million in Missiles and Fire Control for a total increase of $350 million above the guidance we provided last quarter. Chart 10 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our outlook for RMS by $80 million. Missiles and Fire Control by $20 million and aeronautics by $15 million for a total increase of $115 million above last quarter’s guidance. And finally, on Chart 11, we have our summary, we're off to a very good start to 2018 with strong financial and operating performance across our portfolio. We continue to see strength in the current level of our backlog as well as our future growth prospects and based on results of the quarter we increased our outlook for sales, operating profit and earnings per share. With that we're ready for your questions. John?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first we go to the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: Yeah. Hey, good morning. Marillyn, there has been some press about Japan and the U.K. collaborating on advanced stealth fighter if you will, I don’t know something kind of called sixth gen, where does Lockheed stand on that, and how does Lockheed view the market for sixth gen fighters and if you could elaborate on that?
Marillyn Hewson: Sure, thanks, Ron, thanks for the question. Well, first of all, we are excited about Japan looking forward on their next aircraft and their replacement of the F-2 and we're exploring options that we could bring forward to them in cooperation with both the Japanese and the U.S. government, but at that time that we will share relevant details around that appropriate time certainly. We do think that our leadership and experience building the fifth generation aircrafts are critical to provide cost effective capabilities that will help support Japan’s future security threats as they go forward.
Ronald Epstein: And conceptually this sort of like a - how can I say, continuation of F-22, I mean, how should we think about the requirements the Japan wants vis-à-vis an F-35?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, at this point, Ron, we are waiting you know it’s really a government-to-government matter, I mean they will outline what their requirements are and we have a great experience on the F-22 and on the F-35 and so they look at the capabilities they need, I think we'll have a very good competitive offering for them.
Operator: Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you so much. Just looking at your change in your EPS guide, how much of the $80 million increase at RMS, it’s from Sikorsky and why and how much of the benefit is from a lower tax rate and what is that tax rate?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, Cai, I will take both of those. So, $80 million at RMS, I will say the lion share of that actually is at Sikorsky. I think we are up if memory serves me right, we're up about $50 million in the first quarter and that trend is expected to continue through the next three quarters or so, so that's the bulk of why we're seeing the increase at RMS is because of Sikorsky. And I think there we are actually finally seeing hopefully getting a little bit of traction with some of the initiatives we put in place and some of the systems, I think that we put in place here recently, that I think are giving a greater insight hopefully into managing some cost controls than the business had previously, so we are hoping that trend continues obviously as we go up through the rest of the year. And then I think your second question, was relative to tax rates and so forth and I think what I had said at the start of this year was we were looking somewhere between 17% to 18%, probably on the higher side of that, and fortunately we have actually had some with the benefit of the little more time looking at the act and some of our planned reductions relative to what we assumed in the act initially, we think we have got some better opportunities than we assumed in January. As well as we been really working some of the R&D tax credit items that we always work really hard and we see some benefit coming there as well. So rather than 17 to 18, I think for the year were looking right around 16% as the effective tax rate nearly simply guidance we are provided today.
Operator: Our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.
Pete Skibitski: Yes, good morning guys. Just may be you guys could talk more about the F-35, head of the program obviously I think has made some comments about your strategy in LRIP [indiscernible] negotiations, and I’m just wondering if you guys are satisfied getting - definitised and when do you think that might complete and what is it just like I mean for the 12 to 14 timeline.
Marillyn Hewson: So Pete, I would just take that to say that, we are in in-depth negotiations and we know that the timeline is just how those negotiations go. So in terms of the date to complete, I mean I think that’s just how the negotiations go forward, it’s probably better to ask the PEO from his perspective Admiral Winter what his timeline is. I think the negotiations are progressing as they should and so we feel pretty good about getting the closure in the near-term.
Bruce Tanner: The other thing I might add Pete is I think we have seen some progress here recently in concert with the joint program office closing on some open items that I think will hopefully foretell some good signs relative to getting the whole program closed in the not too distant future. I mean as far as - I think the other part of your question was relative to the block buy 12 through 14. I don't see this being an issue, at least at this point, the other 12 to 14 is more of a funding issue at this point in time, that are negotiation issue. We clearly like to get 11 behind us so we can focus on that and hopefully we are on the right path to get that done in the not too distant future.
Pete Skibitski: Okay, and how you pass this issue with a whole - the recent delivery halt.
Marillyn Hewson: We are not, we are still progressing along with joint program office on that. It’s not affecting production at all, because we continue to produce the F-35, that continues and we are confident, we are going to meet our deliveries this year of over 90 aircraft for 2018. It’s just a temporary suspension that they have on accepting some aircraft until we reach agreement on a contractual issue and so we are working through that contractual issue with them and you know as you know the way we recognize revenue based on cost incurred, so we are posting to head on production and sustainment of the aircraft. And we will get resolution at this soon, I’m expecting.
Operator: Next we will go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hey good morning everyone. Marillyn I wanted to ask on the defense budget bigger picture , clearly there have been a few reasonably sizable step ups in investment spending here over the last few years, but when you are speaking to those that have been a part of that seemingly bipartisan decision, it is not discussion at this point now that we have 2018 spending where it is, is that discussion closer to hey we have now had these big step ups, we're relatively close to where we need to be relative to the capabilities we need and the recapitalization we need and we're likely to just sort of grow in line with inflation off of this reset level or is that conversation closer to hey this is great, but we're actually still far short of where we need to be for all the capabilities and recapitalization we need.
Marillyn Hewson: Well in my discussions, I think first off this increase in defense spending was tremendously welcome to our customers, you know we have been in a situation with the budget caps and others where the spending on recapitalization as well as on readiness was not at the level it needed to be. So I see that as welcomed and certainly for industry it’s welcomed, in terms of the planning and stability that we can see at least for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, and we still have limiting out there this whole issue of sequestration, which everybody would like to see go away. So I won't ignore the fact that that's sitting out there, but what I would say is that the dialogue I have is about the very difficult situation in global security around the world it's just unpredictable, there is a need to move with speed and agility to address the threats that are there, and so is it enough, I mean you know, we don't talk specific numbers and it is not that I haven’t heard anybody say it's enough. I mean there is not much there in new starts, there is not much there in recapitalization and we know that we really got to focus on that, it’s all some of the near-term issues on readiness to address that, but the need for what is happening with you know what I think secretary matters called the great power competitions with Russia and China and other geopolitical rivals out there that we got to stay on our game and continue to invest. We're doing that at Lockheed Martin, we're investing in a lot of technology that we think will be important to our customers in the near-term and in the long-term way, but the threats are not going away they are accelerating and so in my view if you just would ask my opinion we need to continue to spend more on defense.
Operator: Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan, please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning, Marillyn there was some language in the most recent proxy that suggests maybe you will stay on longer as CEO than maybe the prior customs of the corporation would've indicated, can you talk a little bit about the thinking behind that and about are there one or two specific things that you are looking to accomplish in the remainder of your tenure.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question, well just speaking in terms of my tenure, I serve at the pleasure of the board as does every CEO of a public company and they determine with me on when is the right time for me to step down, so I think it was important for us in our proxy to make that clear, just because people often look at ages and where people are in their long-term program. I'm happy to report that I celebrated 35 years with Lockheed Martin in January, so I do have a long tenure with the corporation, but I intend to stay on longer and so in terms of what I want to accomplish, I want to continue to sustain the success of this Company with the hundred thousands of men and women that are working hard every day to support our customers. You know my focus is on how we continue to drive innovation, how we continue to drive performance, the things that we are doing to align with the needs of our customers and make sure that we're performing on the work we're doing today, but we are looking beyond today and also for our shareholders to have a disciplined approach to how we manage the company and make sure that we create shareholder value and bring value to them in the long-term. So, in a nutshell, I serve at the pleasure of the Board. They elect me annually and I would like to continue to work for some time.
Operator: And next we will go to Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: Marillynand, Bruce, Greg good morning. How are you?
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good. Thanks.
Richard Safran: So, I would like to ask about your cash flow guidance. Bruce, you took up your numbers, operating profit sales, but you left your 2018 cash from operations guide alone. So first part is, I would like to know if you could just discuss what the thinking was there? And Marillyn, in your opening remarks you talked a bunch about the increases to the investment accounts, so as the second part planned defense spending in 2019 at least it seems to be was a bit above expectations due to lifting of the spending caps, but there wasn't any update on the long-term cash from operations guide. So I thought maybe you could discuss those two items there and how are you thinking about that?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, Richard, let me take the first part of that on cash flow guidance and you are right. We did leave 2018 alone and the thought was a pretty simple thought, I mean, nothing more complicated then, we basically did what we thought we were going to do in the first quarter and then see upside to what our expectations were in the first quarter. And therefore, we didn't increase our outlook for the year. We have got another three quarters to go for the year. We'll watch that very closely and we'll see if how much of some of the profit improvement actually translates into higher cash improvement throughout the rest of the year and we will update you as you go there. We typically had better performance on cash flow than we said at the start of the year. I'm not predicting that here in the first quarter yet. But, we'll see as we progress throughout the year. We said at least $3 billion greater than or equal to that and that’s still what we're seeing as we sit here today.
Marillyn Hewson: And just to answer the second part of your first question, we remain hopeful for growth, higher growth, based on the press outs on the budget for 2018 and we hope to see that in 2019 for Lockheed Martin, our programs will still be well-supported, and we will see additional opportunities there. We don't know specifically how that will play out, because we're a long cycle business and we are going to wait on the final details and the timing of when these things are enacted and get put on contract. So we will see when the orders hit; and then, therefore, that will drive the sales and then ultimately the timing of the cash from operations. So I can’t really give you a real specific answer to that other than to say just as we always do we look at the opportunities that come. In addition to that, I might mention, there are some other discrete proposals that are in process that could also impact our projections. As you know, we're pursuing the advanced pilot system, the TX is the terminology we typically use for it, but as well as MQ-25 and the Huey replacement and some others. So those also will have some play into our opportunities looking forward, and then the timing of cash.
Bruce Tanner: Rich, I might just add a little bit to what Marillyn said as well. She mentioned during her prepared remarks the fact that we get more than $7 billion worth of business in the Omnibus bill that just closed, you should think of all that as essentially over and above what we were assuming when we put our guidance out previously. So when we talked in January about having $17 billion over the next three years roughly $3 billion in 2018, roughly $7 billion each in 2019 and 2020 nothing has changed to that, there as Marillyn said, there are number of awards that we are waiting on that whether if we win or lose could have some slight impact on the near-term of that. But as we sit here today, we still feel really good about that $17 billion over three year and again with the increase in the budget that Marillyn talked about, hopefully there are some prospects that weren’t in our plan when came up with those numbers.
Operator: Next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Thanks Good morning Marillyn and Bruce. Marillyn thanks for the color on Saudi. If you guys quantified in terms of the opportunity that you are looking at there and if that’s possible and then Bruce just quickly on three deliveries of the C-130 in the in the first quarter can you kind of give us a expectations for the year or may be the cadence of the year. Thanks.
Marillyn Hewson: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia opportunity the only qualification that we have done enrolling it up as a potential was what we did last May. When the agreements were signed between the Kingdom and the United States government about opportunities and if you recall I think it was something like a $100 billion worth of opportunities that were outlined in that rolled up agreement. So when we looked at where our opportunities were in that form Fed, the multi mission surface combatants, to radar, to helicopters, to aero stats a range of things, we communicated that we saw a potential of $28 billion, of course that would roll out over whatever number of years when those orders were placed, contracts signed and so forth, but that’s in essence what we have communicated in terms of the size of the opportunity.
Bruce Tanner: Peter the C-130 delivers, we were a little light in the first quarter, I think that's just sort of the contractual schedule that fell in place in the first quarter, nothing unusual about that. As we look at the remaining quarters for C-130 delivery. I think they are going to average somewhere seven or eight, we might have one quarter or so, where it bounces up to nine aircraft in the particular quarter. So much higher than what we saw in the first quarter, not a whole lot different than what we saw last year though. I will remind you though this and I appreciate the question on the deliveries, but this is one of the programs obviously that with the new revenue recognition is also being recognized on a cost-to-cost, so the timing of deliveries might not have as much impact obviously on the C-130 programs as it get in years past, just may be to state the obvious.
Operator: Next we will go to Douglas Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harned: Thank you good morning. Looking at your Missiles and Fire Control results which you talked about higher volume on missiles for the quarter. We also saw a big backlog gain in missiles in Q4 and there is some significant budget increases in this area over the next year two years. So when you look at this stage, do you see the surge in missile demand as a short-term trend or something that is likely that persist for a longer period say five or more years? And what would drive that?
Bruce Tanner: I will take a shot at this. Look I think your observations are spot on. I know when I looked at the long-range planning our three-year plan the thing that sort of jumped off the pace to me is Missiles and Fire Controls is amongst our highest growth business areas over that three-year plan period. And that was sort of under the original President’s budget without taking into consideration a number of things that fell out from the Omnibus for instance. So I think this is a trend that we see increasing at U.S., I think it’s just with the short-term or is it may be out there for five years. I think in every single missile opportunity that we have and that’s always you know PAC-3, the THAAD to JASSMs, the Hellfires, GMLRS, we are looking at increasing the capacity, increasing our build rates in every single one of those categories in the not too distant future. So I think what you are seeing is not an aberration and I would say it is going to in my judgment last longer than a shorter duration five years or so I think that's a possibility definitely Doug.
Operator: And we will go to Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Matthew McConnell: Thank you good morning. So your 10K this year had some new language about the government taking increasingly aggressive positions around intellectual property rights. Could you elaborate on what has changed or what you were referring to their and how you are reacting to that change?
Marillyn Hewson: Sure Matt, I will just take that. I mean we are seeing - it's not across the board on opportunity that we are pursuing with the U.S. government, but there have been some cases where there have been sort of an unbounded requests for all of the intellectual property rights for us to pursue an opportunity and while we may be able to commit to that from a Lockheed Martin standpoint our challenge that we outlined is that it's very difficult for us to commit to that for our supply chain. And so we have had some recent RFPs where the intellectual property rights request is seen, in fact we did a pre-award protest for the UH-1N replacement, the Huey replacement because we could not get to a position with the U.S. government in the dialogue up to that point to be comfortable that we could certify that we could provide all of the intellectual property that they requested, because we couldn’t certify that we could bring fourth all of that for some of our subcontractors. So that’s just one example there. I don’t know if you want to add anything or not Bruce.
Bruce Tanner: Yes, I would just piggyback a little bit on what Marillyn said, I think the Huey replacement program is a good example where we have had the Blackhawk helicopter being supported through the Army depots for however long we have been flying or they have been flying Blackhawk helicopters probably 30 years or so, and yet the request that came with the Huey replacement program admittedly an Air force program was actually for far more data and I will say the army is using today to support those aircraft and the fleet. So it’s a little puzzle as to why the same helicopter would have two different requirements for intellectual property when the government is already supporting that aircraft to the army depots. And that's what we're talking about, it’s just a little bit of a head scratcher sometimes, often times, these are existing platforms with a new request for intellectual property that’s a little puzzling. As Marillyn said, a lot of it has to do with not so much with Lockheed Martin IP as that of our subcontractors, including, more puzzling than most, a lot of software. And in some cases even some commercial software applications. So that’s the reason it's mentioned in the 10-K. That's the reason we filed the pre-award protest that Marillyn said on the Huey replacement program.
Operator: Our next question is from Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joseph DeNardi: Yeah, thanks very much. Bruce, I wondered if you could just provide some sensitivity around the pension relative to kind of performance of equity markets over the next few years? Just to assume that as we experience kind of the flat S&P for the next five years. What would that do to your cash funding requirement? Thank you.
Bruce Tanner: Hey Joe that’s a good question. As we have taken a look at that. And we have mentioned in the past that we actually get to a full freeze in the pension from January 1, 2020. So it’s sort of disproportionately impactful if that's the right word to use, up until 2020 and then post 2020. So we're more sensitive as you just asked the question to asset returns in the near-term believe it or not than we are which has historically not been the case. We typically have been more sensitive to discount rate changes, but because the sort of the length of time until the plan becomes fully frozen is getting shorter by the day. We're less sensitive to the discount rate changes between now and then. Asset returns, we have greater sensitivity too, but you shouldn't think of them as being - we have taken I'll say scenarios where we have assumed, instead of the 7.5%, we have assumed zero percent return or zero return in 2018 for instance, just for sensitivity purposes. And then we have actually gone to some negative scenarios. It's not a huge change. You shouldn’t think of it as being something that where we would have I will say changes to the $17 billion that we talked about earlier as being a significant change to that in total outlook is the way I would characterize it.
Operator: Your next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Thank you so much. Good morning. I thought I would ask you a quick question about GPS III and the Follow On contract there, the competition there. It looks like some of your peers may not bid for this. And I was wondering how that changes the dynamic for you to obviously increases the chance of winning. But also is there anything different in that follow-on contract that makes it less financially attractive than the current situation?
Marillyn Hewson: So, I can’t speak for our competitors, but I can just tell you that we feel very confident about our proposal for the GPS III Follow On. We already submitted those, we put out a release that we have a fully compliant proposal that we have submitted and it’s for us as we see it as follow-on. It’s an opportunity for another 22 next generation satellites to be brought in, we have invested a lot in design with flexible, modular architecture that allows us to bring down costs. But more over that it also is at a low-risk approach to continuing the GPS III F Solution so that’s one thing that I would add is that we think we are performing well on ones that we are producing today and this Follow On, I think we are well position to continue for the Follow On.
Bruce Tanner: The other thing I might add Rob is I think the reason for the competition in the first place is we didn't perform as well as we otherwise could have on the first few satellites, we had some payload issues in particular there. I will say those we think have been cleaned up, I mean we feel really, really good about the performance of the satellites we are producing now, I think the government is also aware that we are performing satellites very well as most of industry. So not to speak for any of our competitors, but I think the fact that the program is performing extremely well right now, serves us well going to this competition and in your second part of your question sort of is a lower profitability or potential that would cause our peers or competitors not want to do this, we don't see it that way. We see it as essentially the same opportunity as what we have had in the past without a change there. So that wouldn’t be a driver from my perspective.
Operator: Next we will go to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rajeev Lalwani: Hi, thanks for the question. Marillyn and Bruce just getting some of the discussion out there around the top-line trajectory on the F-35 program, can you maybe just provide some thoughts on how you see revenue growth looking over the next several years for the program and if not may be just thoughts on how it compares to the overall growth rate of the company and to the end of the decade and beyond.
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Rajeev I will take that one and Marillyn can add some top cover if she wants to, but look I think in terms of F-35, the F-35 program in general is going to grow at a faster rate than the corporation is all the way through the end of the decade. In fact I would do tell you that it’s going to do that beyond the end of the decade. We don't reach peak production volumes until I think 2023 or 2024 timeframe somewhere that timeframe, so you should think obviously we spend the dollars since F-35 is also on the cost-to-cost where were recordings sales sooner than we were getting those deliveries, so it’s a little bit push to the left if you will. But even with that you should think of that peak is sort of not occurring until past the end of this decade and then our expectation is that with sustainment, the sheer number of aircraft that are in the field growing significantly between now and then that sustainment will help position that growth in the future even when the production starts to slow down. The last thing I would add is there is still even though as Marilyn said in her prepared remarks, we completed the STD program, there is already the idea, plans in place of the follow-on modernization of the F-35, not just for the U.S government but for international customers as well. So there will be the sustaining level of development. Just like there is a sustaining level of development and modification work that we're currently doing and F-22's and F-16s that are decades past their peak production period. We are going to see that going for a long, long time on the F-35 program.
Marillyn Hewson: The other thing I would add Rajeev is that we currently have of course the three U.S services, the eight international partners, three for military sales partners on the program, but there is a lot of interest beyond that with many countries around the world that want to buy the F-35, and so while we have a program of record that we can talk about what we see as the production plan for that, we expect to be selling more F-35s around the world in the coming year so that will be another indicator of continued revenue from the F-35 program and production sustainment and as Bruce said continued modernization and upgrade.
Operator: Our next question's from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning Bruce it looks like you raised the margin rate on the F-35 again based on the numbers that you gave, so just wanted to validate that. And then second, could you tell us how many deliveries the Air Force currently hasn't taken and what kind of impact that might have had on cash flow in the quarter. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Yes, good questions George, so there was a slight pickup on the total F-35 program, I think the biggest single drivers I recall is we had some increases once again, I think as we did last year on some of our international FACO so this is a Final Assembly and Check Out facility, those are going extremely well and this is another example of this quarter where we recognized some of the benefits of the performance we're seeing there, taking place actually greater than it was a year ago this quarter. So that's the primary reason for the upper in the F-35 program And then that said the other question was relative to the number of aircraft that are on hold that’s lost track in the quarter George, I want to say it was - I would say its mid single-digits to upper single digits, I have lost track of F-35s, so not a huge impact cash, obviously it didn’t change sales or earnings because of the way we recognized revenue, but slight impact on cash although nit much because most of those withholds occurred later in the quarter where they weren't going to get collective in any event. So our expectation would be, come second quarter hopefully we have got this behind us and there will be no impact to cash in the second quarter.
Operator: Next question's from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.
David Strauss: Thanks, good morning. Wanted to try and put a finer point on the budget upside that you saw come through and what it means for growth going forward, so you have obviously you know in the past talked about growth accelerating from 2% to 3%, I'm talking top line growth accelerating from 2% to 3% this year to like 4% to 5% in 2019, given the extra $7 billion that you saw come through in normal kind of spend rates what do think that implies for that 4% to 5% number and then as a follow-up Bruce if you could just update us on C-5 and potential resolution there. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: David you got a good memory there, I'll give you credit for that one. The first part of your question's a really good one, I'll say this, it's at least a $64 million question and it's a question that is almost unanswerable at this point in time, we got to see when that $7 billion start manifesting itself in terms of contract modifications or contract awards to add those increases to our existing programs and my guess is they're all going to get phased-in differently so in some cases on some the missile and the like we are actually sort of at capacity this year. So I would say just in general I wouldn't expect to see much of any of this shift in 2018, and my guess is it will get spread over 2019, 2020 and 2021 timeframes and maybe even a little further out than that. Let's talk the F-35s, for instance, those I would like to think we could get them in the somewhere in the 12, 13, 14 block buy, but we are off right now going out to suppliers and sort of getting quantities of aircrafts locked down with our suppliers. So it depends on when they gets authorized and again modded to the contracts that we already have. But, if I were a betting person, I would say you should think most of that’s going to happen in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and obviously, David, I will give you the better insight because we will get better insight into it, as the year goes along, but definitely in the October timeframe when we give trend information for 2019, we'll try to talk about, what it looks like beyond 2019 at that point in time. I think your last question is on the C-5 equitable adjustment. I literally don't think I have any news on that, David. This year, we finished delivering the last modernized C-5 aircraft, I want to say that aircraft is in, like, the third quarter of this year. My guess is, we will get a lot more action on that closure once the total program is closed if that makes sense. So again, nothing planned from our perspective, relative to if it doesn’t happen this year, it’s not like that’s a downer or a hit to this year because we don’t have that plan this year. We haven't talked about that, frankly, in the future years as well, but we still expect we have a very good case there. So, no news to report is the short answer.
Greg Gardner: John, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And that will be from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Hunter Kent Keay: Hey, good morning. Thanks for getting me in. On the supersonic X-plane, is this your technology? I’m wondering if there is a remote scenario where Lockheed reenters the commercial aircraft market, if this design proves out and how your experience moving into the commercial market with the LM-100J might persuade you to do that. Thank you.
Marillyn Hewson: Well, to your point, Hunter, we do have LM-100J and we are happy to have that as a commercial offering. It's a follow-on to LM-100s that we sold to the 100 customers some years back. So having an opportunity to refresh that we also as you have probably seen, are supporting another company that is coming out with the supersonic jet business jet offering Aerion and we are supporting them on their project with some engineering support and other things. But in terms of our foray into the commercial aircraft aviation side, we don't read too much into this, this technology that we're working on with the low boom, I mean what we are bringing is that we can bring out Skunk Works, which is the low boom technology and a lot of other technology that we can support. I apologize. I'm fighting a cold here, so my voice is getting a bit scratchy here, but point being what company is come to us, whether its NASA or its commercial companies is our deep knowledge and experience and technology that we can bring to support new technology. So as I mentioned earlier, we are engaged a lot in hypersonic and directed energy. And now this is a follow-on to some low boom technology work that we have done with NASA to take it to the next level. And our Skunk Works operation is working on it; as there are a lot of our advanced technology labs across the Corporation, working lot of fascinating and interesting advanced technology to help both on the commercial and the military side.
Greg Gardner: Thanks, John this is Greg, I think we have come up at the top of the hour here. So, I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for some final thoughts.
Marillyn Hewson: Sure, I will make it brief since I’m losing my voice here. However, just thank you all for [Technical Difficulty] and by highlighting that we have an outstanding quarter and we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term value to our customers and to our stockholders. So we look forward joining us on the next call and that concludes our call for the day John.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentleman that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's executive teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference now to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

Please access our Web site at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today and I hope you have all had a good start to the New Year. Let me begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to the entire Lockheed Martin team for their contributions and commitment throughout 2017. It was through their dedication and efforts that we were able to deliver strong financial results for our stockholders an outstanding operational performance for our customers. Thanks to their focus on mission success, we are well positioned for long-term growth and I am excited by the prospects the future holds.  2017 was an exceptional year of achievement with strong operational results and new historical high watermarks for sales, orders and cash from operations. We were pleased to see our 2017 sales eclipse $51 billion, representing growth of 8% over 2016 results. Our 2017 growth was broad-based with each of our four business areas exceeding last year's results. Leading this increase was our aeronautics business area. Fueled by 18% growth in the F-35 program, followed by our missiles and fire control business area, exceeding 2016 sales by 9%, driven by both tactical missiles and air and missile defense products. We ended 2017 with approximately $100 billion in backlog, the result of our record orders and strong yearly book to bill ratio which have the corporation well positioned for continued growth. I would also like to highlight our performance in driving cash from operations as we generated $1.5 billion in cash during the fourth quarter and $6.5 billion for the year. These results allow us to continue our balance cash deployment strategy as we returned over $4 billion to stockholders through a combination of our commitment to dividends and our share repurchase program. The corporation also funded a record level of investment in independent research and development and capital expenditure, developing new technologies and positioning the business for future growth. As we noted in today's earnings release, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and will provide long-term benefits for the corporation. In the short term it did result in a onetime non-cash increase to income tax expense that caused our reported earnings to fall below the guidance ranges we communicated in October. We will discuss tax reform in detail later on the call but the impact of this onetime charge does not diminish the outstanding operational and financial performance we delivered in 2017. Turning to the Department of Defense of budget, the federal government remains under a continuing resolution or CR for fiscal year 2018 with an extension now in place through the 8th of February. While we are disappointed at the need for the recent extension, there continue to be positive indications of future budget growth despite the current short term CR. First, in December President Trump released the administration's National Security Strategy, a broad overview of global challenges and the over-arching strategies to address them. Notably, the strategy underscores the need for additional investment in the U.S. military and our country's national defense. This month, the defense department also released its 2018 National Defense Strategy, which reinforces the themes of the National Security Document. Specifically, both strategies highlight the commitment to layered missile defense as well as modernization of our military's weapon systems and readiness with emphasis on nuclear, space, cyber and intelligence capabilities. We believe our portfolio is well aligned to these objectives and we are hopeful appropriations will be enacted which support both the national security and national defense strategies. Also the Continuing Resolution Bill that the government passed in December, included an additional $4.7 billion over the prior CR for emergency defense funding. Of the $4.7 billion, nearly $4 billion was targeted for missile defense needs, a key element of the National Security Strategy and included request for 50 additional THAAD interceptors and nearly 150 of our PAC-3 MSE missiles. This action represents an increase in missile defense funding of approximately 50% over fiscal year 2017 enacted amounts. A clear recognition of the need for the country to maintain a leadership position in this vital area of national security. Lastly, in December President Trump signed into law the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act or NDAA. The bill which was passed by Congress with bipartisan support authorized over $626 billion in base defense spending, as well as $65 billion in overseas contingency operations funds. The NDAA base budget authority would exceed both fiscal year 2017 enacted amounts and the presidential request for FY2018 that was released last spring and would be in excess of the budget control spending caps. As I have noted before, legislation is still needed to adjust the future spending limits imposed by the budget control act. We are encouraged by recent legislative activity and we continue to urge our lawmakers to work towards an agreement which modifies the budget cap and provides the defense spending required to deliver to our military the resources vital to our national security. Moving to tax reform. We were pleased to see this important piece of legislation enacted and we believe it will have a positive impact on our corporation and allow American companies to compete more effectively in global pursuit. The new law reduces the combined U.S. corporate tax rate from the highest in the industrialized world, bringing it in line with the tax rates used in the most advanced economies. This will enable us and just as importantly many of our supply chain partners to invest in transformative technologies and make decisions that we anticipate will enhance our competitive position in the 21st century, supporting growth and long-term benefits for customers, employees and stockholders. We believe this legislation will encourage investment, innovation and job creation across industry. It is important to recognize that the benefit that we will realize in 2018 continue into the future and we are currently exploring options to use these future benefits in ways that will support the growth of our company and deliver long-term value to our stakeholders. One immediate and proactive measure our corporation implemented was deciding to accelerate payments into our pension trust in 2018. As a result of this decision, we will contribute $5 billion in cash, satisfying our required pension contributions until 2021. We are also exploring other investments as a result of the new legislation to enhance our competitive posture and long-term growth potential. Some of these initiatives include increasing our employee training and educational offerings to drive critical skill development, increasing our charitable contributions in science, technology, engineering and maths, or STEM programs, the life blood of our future talent pool, including the creation of a STEM scholarship fund to encourage participation in these important fields of study. Increasing the Lockheed Martin ventures investment fund that we established over a decade ago, whose charter is to make strategic investments in early stage companies that are developing disruptive cutting-edge technologies in core businesses and new areas that are important to Lockheed Martin. We expect these investments will enable these companies to mature their technologies, grow their businesses and create jobs. Building on our 2017 record investments in capital expenditures and research and development, we will increase our commitment in these areas by a combined $200 million in 20189 as we continue to invest in the assets required to efficiently execute our business as well as the technologies needed to drive long-term growth. We will continue to assess these and other options with the objective of using the benefits of tax reform to drive growth in our business, attract and retain high performing talent, create new employment opportunities and enhance future cash deployment actions. Moving on, I would like to highlight several operational milestones we achieved across the corporation during the recent few months. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program, during the fourth quarter we met our joint government and industry commitment by delivering the 66 aircraft in 2017. This accomplishment represents a 40% increase from the previous year as we continue to ramp up production on this transformational fighter. We anticipate this momentum continuing into 2018 and now expect to deliver approximately 90 jets this year, an increase of over 35% from 2017 as we continue to progress to full rate production in the next few years. To date, we have delivered over 265 planes to U.S. and international customers. We are excited to see the international community embrace the F-35 with Norway receiving their first three conventional take-off and landing F-35As with the three CTOL variants landing Norwegian soil in November. Israel declaring initial operating capability for their first squadron of CTOL jets and through 2017, seven of our current 11 international customers have accepted the F-35 deliveries and we look forward to working with both existing and potential new buyers to satisfy growing future demand. Moving to our missiles and fire control business area. Our PAC-3 team achieved several notable milestones, including successfully neutralizing four tactical ballistic missile targets in a complex test at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, satisfying a requirement that opens the door to full rate production for our PAC-3 MSE interceptor. Participating in a signing agreement with U.S. and Romanian officials providing Romania the opportunity to upgrade its air defense system by purchasing PAC-3 MSE missiles and receiving an order of over $900 million for PAC-3 missiles for the United States and allied military forces. In the rotary and mission systems business area, we were pleased to see that the cabinet of Japan agreed to the purchase of two Aegis Ashore batteries which will increase that countries missile defense capabilities and provide greater protection for the Japanese people. The Japan maritime self-defense force currently operates multiple Aegis equipped destroyers and has been a long-term supporter of our Aegis ballistic missile defense technology. The installation of the two land-based Aegis Ashore batteries would supplement the Aegis sea based systems to deliver improved layer missile defense capability, allowing coverage over a wider range with the ability to address a greater number of threats. While this opportunity remains to be finalized, we were excited by the confidence that the Japanese government continues to show in our Aegis product. Once operational, the Japanese installation will be the third Aegis ashore deployment, adding to those operated by the U.S. in Romania and Poland. Our [quarter] [ph] with our space business area through space based infrared system or SBIRS satellite was delivered to the air force at Cape Canaveral air station in October and was successfully launched in the orbit on a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket just ten days ago, ULA's 125th successful mission since being founded in 2006. The geo-synchronous earth orbit or geo satellite is the fourth of our six satellite constellation to be deployed and is a key part of our nation's missile defense system. The SBIRS system enhances the military surveillance abilities and expands technical information gathering and situational awareness capability, collected from satellite powerful sensors and converting it into actionable information for defense and intelligence applications. We are extremely proud to be able to provide this crucial product in support of our country's security and defense. I will now turn the call over to Bruce to review our 2017 financial performance and discuss our expectations for 2018. We will then open up the lines for your questions.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn and good morning, everyone. I will be making remarks based on the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results. We finished the year with strong results in all key financial metrics. Sales exceeded $15 billion in the quarter, rebounding as expected from the lower than planned sales in the third quarter resulting in $51 billion in sales for the year. Segment operating profit was line with our expectations for the year at $5.1 billion, driving our earnings per share to $13.33, prior to the onetime adjustment to recognize the impact of the new corporate tax rate on our deferred tax asset balances at the end of the year. We continue to have strong cash performance in the quarter, generating $6.5 billion for the full year. We delivered on our commitments to return cash to stockholders with $4.2 billion returned through dividends and share repurchases and we ended the year with about $100 billion in backlog. So we are pleased with our overall performance in 2017. On chart 4 we compare our sales for 2017 with our sales for 2016. Sales grew 8% over last year's results to just over $51 billion for the year, which is the highest level we have ever achieved. I will show how that growth was spread amongst our four business areas on the next chart. Chart 5 compares 2017 sales levels versus last year's results for each of the business areas. All four business areas grew sales compared to 2016. Aeronautics was up 13% over last year driven primarily by higher F-35 production and sustainment volume and those delivery of two additional C-130 aircraft in the year. Rotary and mission systems grew 6% in 2017. Due to lower purchase accounting adjustments in 2017, as well as a favorable change in aircraft mix. Missile and fire control grew 9% in 2017 driven by higher volume and deliveries in the fire control, tactical missiles and air defense lines of business. And finally, space was slightly higher than last year with higher AWE sales more than offsetting the volume from two commercial launches in 2016 versus none in 2017 and lower government satellite volume this year. On chart 6 we compare our earnings per share in 2017 with our results from 2016. As I said on the first Slide, our EPS for this year before the impacts of tax reform, is $13.33, or about $1 higher than our EPS in 2016. On a GAAP basis, our EPS was $6.64 after recognizing a $1.9 billion charge to earnings, primarily to reflect the lower value of our deferred tax assets at the lower statutory rate of 21%. And as you could tell from our cash performance in the year, this charge had minimal impact on cash from operations. We show our cash performance on chart 7. We generated $6.5 billion in cash from operations in the year, about $300 million higher than we had outlook during the October call and a record level for the corporation. This amount represents a 25% increase in cash from operations over the 2016 result which was itself a record level at that time. Chart 8 shows the amount of cash returned to stockholders during the year, with $6.5 billion in cash from operations and almost $1.2 billion of capital expenditures in the year, our free cash flow was $5.3 billion. And with almost $4.2 billion of cash returned in the form of either dividends or share repurchases, we returned 79% of our free cash flow in the year. Chart 9 provides both our pro forma 2017 results and our 2018 outlook under the new revenue recognition methodology that became effective on January 1st of this year. Our sales and segment operating profit were in line with the estimate that we provided during the October call. You will notice that our pro forma results also reflect the new accounting standard to record only the FAS pension service cost and operating profit and non-service FAS pension cost and non-operating costs. Because our pro forma segment operating profit was similar to the profit under the old revenue recognition methodology, our EPS is close to as reported for 2017. And of course, cash from operations was not affected by the revenue recognition change. Our outlook for 2018 sales and segment operating profit is also about what we provided during the October call with sales growing about 2% over the 2017 level and a margin of 10.4% at the midpoint. Projected EPS for 2018 is significantly higher than 2017 due to the lower tax rate, higher segment operating profit and improved FAS/CAS outlook that I will describe in a couple of charts. Cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $3 billion after our decision to accelerate $3.4 billion worth of required pension contributions for 2019 and 2020 into 2018 or a total contribution of $5 billion in order to retain the tax deduction for these contributions at the old statutory rate of 35%. The $3 billion outlook for cash from operations may seem higher than expected given that we have provided a preliminary outlook of $5 billion in cash from operations for 2018 during our discussion on the October call and we are contributing an additional $3.4 billion more to our pension trust than we discussed at that time. The reason for the higher cash is twofold. First, we expect to have about $900 million refund from our 2017 taxes paid because of the additional pension contributions and we also expect to pay about $500 million less in cash taxes during 2018 as a result of tax reform. I will also provide more insight into what this acceleration of pension funding means for out year cash from operations in a couple of charts. Chart 10 shows our outlook for 2018 sales and segment operating profit by business area. We have provided pro forma sales and segment operating profit for 2016 and 2017 reflecting the new revenue standard and pension expense presentation in the attachments to our earnings release for comparison purposes. Turning to chart 11. We show the updated FAS/CAS adjustment outlook for 2018 compared with what we discussed in October [indiscernible] basis points versus the level we expected in October to a rate of 3.625% and that lowered the FAS/CAS adjustment by $115 million. Our actual return on assets in 2017 increased through the end of the year to 13% versus the 9% we assumed in October, improving the adjustment by $75 million. We revised the longevity assumptions for our plan participants which improved the adjustment by $25 million and the planned asset returns on the additional $3.4 billion of contributions in the year, improve the adjustment by $165 million to the current outlook of just over $1 billion for the year. Chart 12 provides a view of how tax reform and our decisions to accelerate required pension contributions impacts our cash from operations outlook for the next three years. We have already described the reason for our 2018 outlook of equal to or greater than $3 billion in cash from operations, we expect to fund this acceleration through cash from operations, cash from the balance sheet and commercial paper rather than long-term debt. And with the acceleration of contributions into 2018, we no longer have required contributions in 2019 or 2020. With this improvement along with the annual benefit from tax reform going forward, we now expect our cash from operations to be equal to or greater than $17 billion for the years 2018 to 2020 with both 2019 and 2020 expected to have around $7 billion in cash generation. Finally, we have our summary on chart 13. We finished the year strong in 2017 and that positioned us well for 2018. The benefits of accelerating our pension contributions into 2018 and the recurring benefits of tax reform provide for significant cash generation in 2019 and 2020. Our portfolio of programs and capabilities positions us well for today's environment and what we expect in the years to come and we plan to make the necessary investments in new technologies, our facilities and our employees to support future growth. With that, we are ready for your questions. John?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we go first to the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Just Bruce, I guess, on your chart 12, if you could maybe talk about the cumulative cash guidance of $17 billion. How do we think about the moving pieces? Pension a bit of, more of a headwind then we thought. Maybe 1.7 in taxes and offset. So how do we think about maybe working capital investments as well as CapEx and any other moving pieces?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So thanks, Sheila. Maybe to reiterate what I said in the prepared remarks. We had, I think we had teed this up actually in the October call that we had some, the return of some fairly significant pension contributions starting in 2018, 19 and 20. And so that’s one of the reasons why we’d expected cash in 2018 to be a little lower than 2017 before all these adjustments took place. So our decision clearly to accelerate the pension contributions in the 2018 was based on the tax benefits, maintaining the tax benefits to 35% rate provides to us. And I think that’s good commonsense as I mean, the one think I would tell you is that doesn’t create per se an extra benefit to us. It's really maintaining the benefit that we had under the old tax rate all along. And the real benefit here is coming from tax reform going forward. And you should think of that as roughly $0.5 billion a year going forward. The working capital question that you asked about is a little convoluted perhaps because some of the pieces on working capital changed under the new revenue recognition approach on the balance sheet, if you will, moving from some inventory numbers up to contract assets but in total we will still think to have no material growth in our working capital over the next three years period frankly. The one -- I think you had one other question, I am sorry, just is top off my head there, you asked about capital expenditures.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Yes.
Bruce Tanner: You know capital expenditures were at a record level in 2017. We actually expect to have a higher level in 2018. A lot of the reason for the additional capital in 2018 is supporting the new wins that we had in 2018. That number stays fairly consistent with where we are expecting 2018 to be and 2019. And then at least current planning is that drops off maybe a little bit in the 2020 timeframe but all that’s dependent upon new opportunities as they present themselves and the potential to have efficiencies that we haven't currently invested in in our contracts going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro: A couple of probably quick ones. The actual tax rate for '18 is going to be what, 18%, 18.5%? The second part, the Sikorsky profit you said was up $60 million but still would suggest to me they only made about $10 million in the quarter. And I know you have got the amortization yet but that still seemed like a low number if you could explore that a little bit. And then the last one is it would seem like the F-35 margin went up a little bit based on the incremental profit that you disclosed. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: I think pretty accurate there. 18% is maybe a little less than that, frankly, is what we are looking at. And just to put maybe a little color behind that, sort of the headline reduction you would expect to see is sort of 14% [indiscernible] 35% tax rate and 21% tax rate. We think our effective tax rate is probably coming down about 10% and the reason for that is two-fold. One, we are losing the manufacturing deduction which was phased out under the new tax policies going forward. That’s worth about 2% change in our effective tax rate. And then if you just think of the other deductions that we have that are still maintained going forward, but each one of them, those are for things like the R&D expense, this is for things like ESAF deductions and the like. While they are maintained, they are worth less under a 21% tax rate than they were under a 35% tax rate and so collectively those are worth about another 2%. So 14% becomes 10% and our 27%, 28% tax rate, sort of before tax reform becomes roughly 17%, 18% going forward. That’s sort of the way we think about that. Sikorsky, $60 million in the quarter. I am just trying to think, George, I think Sikorsky had actually a pretty good quarter in 2017. I mean that’s, in fact I think that was, if I am not mistaken, that was probably the highest quarter of profit in the four quarters for 2017. So I think we are pleased actually with the results in the quarter. We obviously had higher aircraft delivery in the quarter and we also had a little bit of an improved mix situation on the deliveries of the aircraft that did occur in the quarter. So we are actually pretty pleased where it is and we think the good news about that is Sikorsky's profitability we expect to be higher in 2018 than in 2017. And then lastly I think you asked about the F-35 margin and you are right. We did have some risk retirements in the quarter on the F-35 program that did result in higher margins in the quarter on the F-35 program. But I will say we had good performance on the manufacturing, especially the production obviously. A portion of the F-35 program throughout the year. This was just the last sort of instantiation of that in the form of some risk retirements that we took in the fourth quarter. So good performance overall.
Operator: And next we will go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Samuel Pearlstein: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about tax reform and some of the moves with regards to pension and how to think about capital allocation. September is when you typically deal with the dividend, now with a much lower operating cash flow number from the pension contribution. Does it change your view of the payout or how to think about dividend growth and then, Bruce, could you just give us a single point where some range is to when you said CapEx is up. What is that number for this year?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Sam, I will take both of those. So capital allocation, U.S. tax reform and capital allocation impacts from that. As you said, and I don’t want to preempt the Board's decision, we will have that conversation in September. But we don’t expect there to be a significant change with any of the capital allocation items that we have already anticipated in our guidance for 2018. So for instance our guidance in October we talked about $1 billion of share repurchases. That won't change. We will have our normal discussion on dividends in September of later this year. And I think our overall capital allocation, I would say it's a little bit opportunistic base going forward. We will see what sort of organic opportunities present themselves that require capital expenditures and that’s clearly our first order of priority in terms of generating organic growth going forward. And then we will take a look at the, what's left over, so to speak, for share repurchases and dividend payouts. But I would think that if you look at our track record for well over a decade, we have had a pretty good track record for I think doing the right things in terms of cash returned to stockholders and supporting the growth needed to support our corporation going forward. So we will continue that going forward. The one thing about our cash flow and in particular the tax reform going forward is it obviously makes our payout ratio a little bit lower than it has been in the past. So it creates at least the opportunity to continue the sorts of dividend increases that we have had in years past but we will face that and cross that bridge in the September timeframe when we do that with our Board, as I said, The absolute number in terms of 2018 CapEx is around $1.3 billion and at least as we sit here today, Sam that 1.3, maybe a little more than that in 2018, is about the same number we will see in 2019. Maybe a little lower than that. But you should think of both years at least, if not rounding to, being pretty close to $1.3 billion. Thanks.
Operator: And next we will go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr: So Bruce, if you could give us a profile of the deliveries and sales and profits of Sikorsky going forward, I mean I assume we are going to see some pickup in commercial deliveries this year. And secondly, you said that, as you look out to 2021, you will have to start pension contributions again, I think by our math you have done significantly well in terms of the contribution and the returns so that you should be relatively near full funding by the end of this year. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Cai, good questions. So I think your first one is delivery profile and sales, earnings and profit going forward for Sikorsky and whether or not we expect to see a pickup in commercial deliveries. You know what's going on with Sikorsky is a pretty good drop off in terms of commercial or -- excuse me, in terms of government aircraft deliveries from 2017 to 2018. You should think of the 2017 was the end of multiyear [eight] [ph] and 2019 is sort of the first year of multiyear nine deliveries. And I think we are down about 50 or so between the Black Hawk program and Naval Hawk program, down some 50 commercial -- excuse me, 50 government helicopters. So pretty good reduction. And part of that is because the multiyear nine was a lower value in terms of overall quantity than multiyear eight and we negotiated a minimum quantity and that’s sort of what's in our planning purposes going forward. We are obviously hopeful and we gave pricing for that in the multiyear for additional aircraft that we hope will openly get plussed up through budget adjustments going forward. The good news is we have already got those aircraft priced, if you will, in the multiyear. So we are kind of at the, hopefully, a bit of the low point there on the government deliveries. As far as commercial, Cai, though I think I have been watching, which I don’t normally do but I have been watching oil prices a bit and $65 here a barrel for at least a couple of weeks or so. I think we have got some more time to wait before and we need $65 a barrel to stay at that level for a little bit longer to sort of drive some of the volume of helicopters in the oil and gas industry. So we are obviously not expecting a large increase on the commercial helicopters in 2018 compared to 2017. And frankly, we are looking pretty flat in 2019 as well. Obviously, that could change pretty quickly depending on oil and gas prices. So as I said, we do watch that closer. Long term with Sikorsky, we like to see the growth coming from the 53K program as we start to enter the low rate production aircraft, excuse me, low rate production phase of that program. And hopefully you should think of sort of the downturn in Black Hawk helicopter deliveries being offset by upticks in 53K volume as well as some of the other development programs we have got going like the Presidential helicopter program as well. So you should think of Sikorsky, this is again kind of a low point in sales in 2018 and some growth going forward in 2017 and beyond. So 53K, I think we are going to be, for those of that attend the Berlin Show, we are actually going to have that aircraft fly in Germany. And we are excited by the prospects of that opportunity not just for the U.S. Marine Corps, which I believe the quantity is about 200 aircraft in the plan of record for the Marine Corps. But we are hopeful that we can sell some international customers, the two most likely to be are either Germany or Israel. I am not sure which order that would be but if you happen to be in Berlin, by all means stop by and see the aircraft flying.
Operator: Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ronald Epstein: Quick question, maybe changing gears a little bit to the F-35 program. On their earnings call, Northrop commented in their mission systems segment that they are producing about 90 units a year which they call peak production rates. And to me that kind of seemed well below the plan of record, I am not sure if they misspoke or what. But just trying to get a sense, I mean are we at peak production rates. I mean that kind of seems consistent with something Pat Shanahan said in public comments already. But I am just trying to get my head around like what peak rates are and where they should be, and I will leave it there.
Bruce Tanner: Hey, Ron. Let me take a shot at that, and I think there was some confusion by both the secretary's comments and I saw what was said by the Northrop Grumman folks as well. I think the message everyone is trying to send is, when you are delivering 90 aircraft or 90 million systems, or 90 of anything, that’s a pretty high production rate. Different than most low rate initial production programs. But the F-35 program is technically not a full rate production until I believe our past LRIP 14, I think the first production lot is sort of fiscal year, or our fiscal year that will be the lot after LRIP 14. So technically we are in low rate initial production but the quantities are very very high and you should just think if we are at 90 some odd units, which is again what Marillyn said we are going to be delivering aircraft flies in 2018, and the mission systems sort of the front end of deliveries. That’s the reason they could be at that rate in 2017. You should think of in the next three to four years, we are going to be at the 150 aircraft per year. So we are not close to the peak of production yet but at the volume we are talking about now, it feels like we are in a production program. I think that’s what the secretary was trying to say is, this is not low rate. If you are delivering 90 aircraft a year, it feels sort of like a production program which you should not think if that is the peak. And, hey, before we go to next one, I realize that I jotted a note down to myself and I completely forgot to answer Cai's last question [indiscernible] contribution. And Cai kind of asked you know, are we getting close to full funding and so forth. One thing I would say is, is one of the things we looked at while we decided on $5 billion is the right number. We are getting close enough to where we -- we need to be careful to not yet overfund it on our pension program. So while funding starts again up in 2021. It starts up at a much much lower level than what we currently funded for the 2019 and 2020 required contributions with our $5 billion. So part of that reason again is in the year 2020, we have the final close or the final freeze, excuse me, of our pension going forward and that’s one of the things that brings that down. But we have been putting a lot of, obviously funding into the pension plan over the past years and just gets us to the level that I just described about to you. Sorry, about that Cai.
Operator: And next we will go to Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran: I would like to ask another different type of question regarding the impact that tax reform here and I am not trying to rein on the parade at all here, but there is a lot of chatter on the hill and within the investment community that the Pentagon is to look to either try to capture or claw back some portion of the tax benefit the defense companies are getting from the lower rates. The thinking is that the government could either renegotiate existing contracts or might look to re-price items on future contracts. Now I am not sure how the government can renegotiate existing contracts but I would like to know if that’s something you are hearing from the government and if so I would like to get your response to that. Maybe discuss how you see your future contract and pricing negotiations being impacted by tax reform.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question, Rich, and I will take that one on because I have been very much involved with my fellow CEOs on looking very hard at this opportunity for tax reform to make this more competitive in the global marketplace. So let's remember first off, what the administration and Congress enacted significant tax reform. It was to make the U.S. economy more globally competitive and to encourage industry to invest in America to create jobs and accelerate economic growth. And Lockheed Martin is one of the leading companies that has been pushing for tax reform. We have had that. So we with that in mind we have this purposely set in mind, as you heard from my remarks earlier, that what the purpose of the tax reform is and as we evaluate options of what we want to do with these tax savings. It's all around that purpose that our government put forward. So as I said in our remarks, our vision is to use these benefits to differentiate ourselves in the global marketplace through investments. And what makes us more innovative and more efficient so that we can grow our business and we can create new jobs. We wanted to also enhance the skills of our current workforce as we look at what's happening with digitization and all that transformation that’s happening. We want to make sure that our workforce is prepared for the future and we also want to make sure that we are an attractive employer for our future workforce by investing STEM activities and helping in the communities where we work. So this is particularly important. If you think about the U.S., we are graduating fewer students with STEM degrees and yet many of our programs require only U.S. citizens to work on them. So we need students who are coming in with STEM educations, to come into those jobs. Frankly, if we don’t do this, I think we would have wasted the incredible potential the tax reform presents to us. If you think about our industry aerospace and defense, it is the backbone of global security and we take this mission very seriously and we are determined to make sure that we remain competitive by investing in our business, by enhancing our critical capabilities, by investing on our human capital, our employees. So that we can help protect the nation, our allies and our partners. So I would just take you back to the point of why the tax reform was put in place. It was to invest in America to create jobs and accelerate economic growth.
Operator: Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rajeev Lalwani: Bruce, Marillyn, on the aeronautics side, can you just walk us through the limited growth of operating profits into '18. I am assuming it would just be the legacy programs offsetting F-35 growth. And then just looking forward, can you help us think about the growth of the segment and where it comes from. Is it going to be the F-35 or maybe some of the other programs you have been talking about?
Bruce Tanner: Within aeronautics you are talking about, Rajeev, the last part of the question.
Rajeev Lalwani: Yes.
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So margin wise at aero, we are guiding towards a little bit lower number in 2018 versus 2017. Back to George's question, we did have a number of risk retirements on some earlier F-35 LRIP production lots that we took in 2017 that at least -- and I will say they were a little higher than what we had planned for in 2017. And so while we have planned risk retirements for F-35 production in 2018, they are not at the same level as they were in 2017. So while we have opportunities, as I always say about this time of the year, to do better than what we are planning. The planning right now is just for a lower level than that. That’s driving it, I will say more than the mix of programs on the F-35. And the one thing that may is not true about what I just said is we are hopeful that there will be a TX or the APT program, the pilot training program for the air force, announced later this year. That will have a slight dilutive effect on the overall margins because it starts kind of slow as a program to begin with, especially if it's later in the year 2018. But that has a slightly lower, not slightly lower, quite a bit lower starting margin than our other programs within aeronautics. I mean you should think of the F-35 now is about on par, margin wise, with the overall aeronautics margins as a whole. And that’s in part because the F-35 program is simply becoming so big relative to aeronautics as a whole. So again, slightly lower in 2018 versus 2017. Maybe the other reason for that is we did finish the last F-16 production aircraft delivery in 2017. We actually have quite a bit of F-16 modernization business but those are sort of starting out in the early phases than is our practice typically on early start programs like that. We are actually starting those off at probably a lower margin than the actual aircraft that deliver at the end of 2017. So I think those two reasons, Rajeev, are the reasons that you are seeing what you are seeing.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Stallard: Marillyn, you mentioned missile defense in your commentary a number of times. I was wondering if you could size the revenue exposure that you had in 2017 and how you expect this end market to grow for the next few years. And then just a quick one for Bruce, how do you expect on the FAS/CAS expense in this new format to track over the next three years to 2020. Thank you.
Marillyn Hewson: Bruce, I am actually going to refer to you on the revenue rolled up on all of missile defense. Because you know it crosses over several business areas between rotary mission systems and [indiscernible].
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So let me take a shot at that Rob. The areas you want to think of, frankly, is we do treat within missiles and fire control, air missile defense has its own line of business and you should think of that, so obviously the PAC-3 programs, THAAD and the [indiscernible] program, when we get that going. That’s about $2.5 billion worth of business a year. What's not included in that and off the top of my head, I am not sure I have got a definitive number for you, is the air missile defense and ballistic missile defense activities that we do at RMS. This is for things like Aegis Ashore but also some of the Aegis BMD work. If I had a guess, a ballpark, it's probably $0.5 billion there and then arguably you could say some of the space based early warning satellites that space systems are also some of that. So if you just kind of combine all those things together, I guess I could do some of the C-2 command and control activities that we do as well.  So maybe $3 billion, $3.5 billion worth of air missile defense and BMD work across literally three of the four business areas that we have today. The second part. The second part of the question was FAS/CAS in the new format. So FAS/CAS doesn’t change because of the new format, it changes how much of pension expense is reflected in operating income versus non-operating. That’s one of the reasons, quite honestly that we have always focused more on segment operating profit as opposed to operating profit, because segment operating profit is unaffected by this. If you just take a step back and take a look at FAS/CAS going forward, we expect FAS/CAS to increase pretty significantly over the next few years. I still see in the year 2020, that we are going to have FAS income rather than FAS expense. And so just to maybe size that for you, you should think of the CAS expense between sort of now and 2022, as we look forward, staying at about $2.5 billion a year. But FAS expense is going to decrease every year over that period of time and actually go to become income in 2020 and higher income in 2021 and higher than that in 2022. So the FAS/CAS adjustment will pick up steam quite a bit starting next year and every year there are after, at least as we can see it all the way through 2022 and beyond.
Operator: And next we will go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Hunter Kent Keay: A little bit more on missile defense, Marillyn, you obviously talked about in your prepared remarks, Bruce thanks for the color you just gave. You obviously had a lot of success in mid-course and terminal but eventually have been able to crack the code on boost phase. And I don’t know if this is also an embedded tax reform question about maybe freeing up some money for some R&D but how do you expect Lockheed to participate in the missile defense form in maybe a boost phase capacity going forward. Is there an opportunity to really kind of think ahead on that and that kind of own that realm if you are able to sort of think forward? Can you talk about layered missile defense, that’s a big part of it.
Marillyn Hewson: That’s a great question, Hunter, and we do look across all elements of helping our customers address those priorities. And we are investing in research and development. So one of the tests that we did recently, we call it [indiscernible] but it was a navy test where we tested our Aegis system with the capabilities of an F-35 and we are able to have the F-35 identify the launch of a target well in advance of when the Aegis radar would have seen it, so bringing a lot of our capabilities together into a total systems solutions is one of the areas that we are investing in and demonstrating some of that capability across domains within our organizations to provide those kind of capabilities to our customers. Beyond that we continue to look at a range of things that we are investing in, such as hypersonics and directed energy and things that would help with any kind of threat that comes early on. And as Bruce outlined for you, we have several systems that are in that defense mode of addressing all phases of a missile launch. Anything you want to add, Bruce?
Bruce Tanner: The only thing I would add Hunter is, no one has the portfolio that Lockheed Martin does in terms of layered defense. I mean if you think of the think of the products we offer with PAC-3, THAAD, the overhead assets with satellites, the incredible fusion of sensors that comes from an F-35 and being able to feed it to an Aegis system, for instance. Having said that, what's termed left of launch is a vexing problem to be solved and Marillyn hit some of the opportunities that we are looking at to do that. Hypersonic capabilities in terms of weapons is one of those things that we are definitely looking at to help solve that problem. But that is high on our list of some of the more vexing problems that we are trying to solve for and definitely one that we are investing in, we will continue to invest in with our technologies going forward. Because it is an issues and it is something that we bring a unique perspective to with all the assets of our portfolio.
Marillyn Hewson: With your point about using some of the savings out of tax reform to go invest back into these areas, I think that is right in line with what would support our customers and will support the defense of our nation.
Operator: And next we will go to Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jon Raviv: What is the path looking like to accelerating sales growth beyond 2018. I know that there is some specific items impacting this upcoming year but just thinking about getting back to that 3% to 5% in '19 and beyond. Some of the things you have good visibility on there. And then also how is that acceleration or how is the shape of the curve impacted by some of the recent budget actions, whether it's extended CR, [sequester] [ph] plays versus Congress marking up budgets to much higher levels than what the President has even requested.
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So, Jon, I will take that one on. As far as the path, as you describe it to accelerating, we now describe 2018 as sort of a transition year. We had obviously significant growth in 2017, all four business areas as I talked about grew individually. We don’t have that situation in 2018 but as we look forward and I think I teed this up on the October call, that 2018 was a bit of a lull and then 2019 and 2020, we expect both of those years to be somewhere in the 4% to 5% growth range as we look at our outlook right now. And to sort of tie that into your question on the budget and the impact of CR, I don’t think CR does a whole lot of impact in 2018. In fact I know it doesn’t. Longer term I am not sure it has a huge impact on 2019 or not. I will say this though, the 4% or 5% that we are talking about is sort of based on the current presidential budget outlook. So some of the numbers that are being tossed about including most recently by the President himself for 2019, as well as some of the comments that Secretary Mattis has made about 2019 being sort of the year that he is going to put his stamp, those are my word, on the DoD budget. Those are baked into the numbers that I just talked about with the 4% to 5% growth. So assuming those come in at anywhere near the levels, the higher levels that we are talking about, I like to see us be able to at least...
Greg Gardner: John, this is Greg. We have got time for one more question.
Operator: And that will be of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn: If it's okay, I would like to ask two things. Bruce just quickly, one for Bruce, one for Marillyn. On the outlook, on the 19, 20 cash flow, if we were to normalize free cash flow and take the $7 billion from your chart 12 and knock off CapEx of a little over $1 billion and may be normalize for the pension contribution. Would it be fair to say free cash flow on a normalized basis is in the high 4s, almost $5 billion.
Bruce Tanner: So I would have said it's in the high 5s. When you said normalized for pension contribution, are you trying to say...
Robert Spingarn: Well, I am putting in what a normal pension contribution, in other words if we smooth what you are doing.
Bruce Tanner: Beyond 2020, you mean, Rob?
Robert Spingarn: Well, yes. Or if we were to factor what you spent this year, the early contribution and normalize for. In other words, we have a timing situation here and I want to think about what the normalized free cash flow is on an ongoing basis.
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So you should again think of, I mean the simplistic way I think of it is, John, you know cash from operations at least for '19 and '20 is $7 billion, is kind of what we teed up there. $1.3 billion I have talked about in 2019 from a CapEx perspective, actually going lower than that. So let's just call it $1.2 billion or so. You have got a $5.7 billion, $5.8 billion free cash flow number pre any pension funding. And as I said, the contribution starting in 2020 are significantly lower than the contributions that we had, that were required in 2019 and 2020 probably by an order of half those contributions that were required. And again, depending on how we do with the asset returns, with the additional $3.4 billion, I am hopeful 2018 is another year of strong asset returns, that number could get smaller. So I think simplistically thinking, free cash flow, we are close to $20 a share in 2019 and 2020 and depending upon what the pension contributions are required in 2020 and beyond.
Marillyn Hewson: You said 2020 but you mean 2021.
Bruce Tanner: 2021, I am sorry. Yes.
Marillyn Hewson: Rob, you had question for me, or -- okay, looks like we lost him. Okay. So I guess we will wrap up the call then. John, thank you. Thank you all of joining us on the call today. I want to end this call by reiterating that we really had an exceptional year. A very strong year and it's because of our outstanding portfolio and our robust backlog that we continue to be well positioned to deliver substantial value to our customers and to our stockholders. So that concludes our call today, John.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. For the conference, all the participant lines will be in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference now to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg M. Gardner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our third quarter results and key accomplishments. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere sympathies to those across our nation affected by the recent hurricane and wildfire disasters. The devastation endured by these communities is heartbreaking and the recovery process is just beginning. I'm especially proud of the generosity shown by the men and women of Lockheed Martin in providing donations through our partnership with the American Red Cross in support of the ongoing relief efforts. Additionally, we deployed our new LM-100J commercial freighter to Puerto Rico to deliver over 78,000 pounds of supplies. The rebuilding of these areas will take time, but we would like the citizens affected by these disasters to know that they are in our thoughts. Moving onto our earnings discussion, as today's release outlined, we had solid results this quarter. I would like to thank the Lockheed Martin team for their continued dedication and performance. We operate in a dynamic environment, and it is through their efforts that we are able to deliver critical solutions in support of our customers' missions and position our company for long-term growth. I'm pleased that our year-to-date financial performance has enabled us to increase our full year 2017 guidance for sales, operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations. We will discuss cash in greater depth later in the call, but I would like to highlight our recent strong performance in this area as we generated $1.8 billion in cash from operations this quarter and $5 billion year-to-date. This performance in driving cash has allowed us to raise our 2017 outlook for the second time this year and we now expect to have cash from operations of greater than or equal to $6.2 billion in 2017. In another key financial metric, I am particularly proud to see that the corporation achieved a record backlog this quarter totaling nearly $104 billion, reflecting the strength of our broad portfolio. This strength in growing backlog and cash generation allowed our board of directors to approve two important cash deployment actions in September. First, we increased the quarterly dividend 10% to $2 per share, or $8 annually. Second, we increased the share repurchase authority by $2 billion, bringing our total to $4 billion. This level provides additional flexibility to make future share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit. Together, these two actions demonstrate our continued strategy of balanced cash deployment and long-term commitment to delivering returns for our stockholders. Bruce will cover the financial results in detail a little later. I'd like to take a moment to provide a bit more color on some of our new business pursuits and the opportunities they present, including recent Foreign Military Sales or FMS notifications. In July, I discussed the F-35 LRIP 11 award we received for U.S. jets just after the close of the second quarter valued at approximately $5.6 billion, and the expectation that we would add an additional order to that lot for international aircraft. We did indeed receive an undefinitized contract for nearly $3.7 billion, bringing our total third quarter 2017 LRIP 11 orders to over $9 billion with 141 aircraft to be delivered in this batch. Keeping with the Aeronautics business area, our team received two notifications from the State Department approving the sale of F-16 upgrades and new aircraft to the government of Bahrain. In the first notification, Bahrain's current fleet of 20 F-16s will be upgraded to the new Viper configuration, with an estimated value for this engineering work of over $1 billion. In a separate announcement, the State Department also approved the sale of 19 new production F-16 Viper aircraft to Bahrain worth approximately $2.8 billion. Once Congressional approval is obtained and the related contracts are executed, we will extend F-16 production beyond the 2021 timeframe. These two requests are indications of the continued demand for this legendary fighter aircraft, and we are eager to complete the FMS process and deliver these capabilities to this long-time customer. Moving to our Missiles and Fire Control business area, since the announcements in May by President Trump and King Salman of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and subsequent to the close of our third quarter, the State Department approved the sale of $15 billion worth of THAAD missile (07:03) completion of the same Congressional approval process as our F-16 notifications. We believe this is a strong indication of our portfolio's broad demand and long-term growth potential. We look forward to working with our U.S. and Saudi customers to finalize this opportunity and to deliver this important capability to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In another new business opportunity in Missiles and Fire Control, we were delighted to be chosen to participate in a Long Range Stand Off or LRSO missile program. LRSO will be the next generation cruise missile for the air-launched portion of the nuclear triad. This $900 million Technical Maturity (sic) [Maturation] and Risk Reduction contract will allow us to develop and refine advanced technologies in support of the final Engineering, Manufacturing and Development competition which will take place in about three years. We look forward to performing on this strategic program and to providing this long-range deterrent capability for our nation and allies. Lastly, we were pleased to be selected as the prime contractor for the U.S. Special Operations Command's next-generation Global Logistics Support Services sustainment program. After over seven years of successfully performing for this customer, it was an honor to be selected in this competition to continue to support this critical mission. This 10-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity or IDIQ contract has the potential to grow to $8 billion in orders which would represent an increase of $3 billion from the ceiling value of our incumbent Special Operations Logistics program. Turning briefly to budgets, the federal government is currently operating under a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2018 that limits the Department of Defense expenditures to previous fiscal year levels through December 8. With a large portion of our backlog work already funded from prior fiscal years, we do not expect significant impacts to our 2017 financials for this current short-term CR. Should the continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints be extended beyond December 8, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2018 orders profile and corresponding backlog level, with the potential of other impacts depending on the duration of the CR. We are encouraged, though, that both the House and Senate have passed their versions of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act bill each by wide margins in a broad show of support. The House is recommending a base defense budget of approximately $593 billion, with the Senate putting forth a target of about $611 billion and these two positions must now be reconciled in conference. Each of these budget proposals reflect significant increases over both President Trump's $575 billion request and fiscal year 2017 enacted amounts. It remains to be seen which measures will be adopted in the final National Defense Authorization Act and what levels of funding will be provided in a separate appropriations process. However, these amounts exceed the current budget caps and legislation is still needed to adjust the spending limits imposed by the Budget Control Act. Passage of this legislation will require bipartisan support. We continue to urge our lawmakers to work towards an agreement, which modifies the budget caps, provides the defense funding required to capitalize our military assets, and delivers to our military the resources vital to our nation's security. Moving on, I would like to highlight several operational milestones we achieved across the corporation during the third quarter. Beginning with an update on our F-35 program, this quarter we successfully surpassed the 100,000 flight hour threshold, exhibiting a significant level of maturity for the aircraft and its flight sciences and mission systems capability, with 98% of our flight testing completed. We remain on track to complete all of the system development and demonstration flight testing in the next few months. To-date, we have delivered over 250 jets since the beginning of the program and we are thrilled with its performance. In addition, recent test achievements have included completion of edge of the envelope maneuvers for the F-35A variant, stressing the limits of the aircraft's structural strength and aerodynamics. Another achievement was a successful completion of Offensive Counter-Air and anti-surface warfare test demonstrating the performance of the F-35 system as well as 42 of planned 43 Weapons Accuracy test with the final test planned for the next several months. We believe we are well-positioned to complete all remaining development milestones as we progress to complete Block 3F capability. In our Rotary and Mission Systems business area, we were awarded our first Low Rate Initial Production or LRIP contract for two Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopters following our successful Milestone C decision in April. With this award, we began production of the most powerful helicopter ever fielded. We will deliver these LRIP 1 helicopters to our U.S. Marine Corps customer in 2020 in support of the Department of Defense's 200 aircraft Plan (sic) [Program] of Record objective. We are excited to be able to bring the incredible capabilities of this remarkable product to our warfighters, as well as to humanitarian or disaster relief missions for those in need. Another area where we had a significant accomplishment this quarter was on the Orion program. Lockheed Martin and NASA engineers at the Kennedy Space Center powered up the next Orion crew module for the first time, initiating the vehicle management systems and power and data units, the brains and heart of the capsule. This spacecraft will embark upon a flight that will take it over 40,000 miles beyond the moon, making this exploration mission (13:48) a crucial milestone for our test campaign. We are honored to be building the Orion deep space exploration vehicle which will take American astronauts back to the moon and eventually Mars. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our third quarter financial performance in more detail. And then, we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. I'll be making remarks based on the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results. We're pleased with our performance in the quarter. Sales of $12.2 billion and segment operating profit of $1.2 billion were slightly lower than our expectations, but we expect this timing-related shortfall will be more than made up for during the fourth quarter, as we will discuss later. Our earnings per share of $3.24 were in line with our expectations, even with the lower sales and profit levels, and were aided by the favorable resolution of several contractual matters that improved our unallocated expense amounts. Cash from operations was very strong at $1.8 billion for the quarter, and we continued to return a significant amount of that cash to our stockholders with $1 billion returned in the quarter. In addition, and as expected, we had a very strong quarter of capturing new business, achieving a record backlog level of $104 billion. We are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations, reflecting our growing confidence as we progress through this year. So I'd characterize the quarter as one with solid performance and improving prospects for the rest of the year and beyond. On chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the third quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales grew 5% compared with last year to $12.2 billion, with most of that growth coming in the Aeronautics business area which grew 14% in the quarter, driven by F-35 volume. Segment operating profit was slightly lower this year after adjusting for the large gain we recognized last year when we obtained a controlling interest in the Atomic Weapons Establishment joint venture in the UK. And as I said on the prior chart, we're increasing our full year outlook for both sales and segment operating profit. Turning to chart 5, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. EPS from continuing operations of $3.24 was lower than last year's amount. But after adjusting for the AWE gain that we recognized last year, our EPS was relatively flat. On chart 6, we'll compare our cash from operations this quarter versus our results from 2016. We generated nearly $1.8 billion of cash in the quarter, almost one-third more than we did in the third quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated almost $5 billion in cash from operations, well on our way to achieving our increased outlook for the year. Chart 7 shows the cash returned to stockholders through the third quarter. After deducting year-to-date capital expenditures from cash from operations, our free cash flow is almost $4.3 billion through the first three quarters. And we returned about $3.1 billion in cash to stockholders, or 72% of free cash flow, fairly evenly divided between dividends and share repurchases. Chart 8 shows the increase in backlog this year to a record level of $104 billion. You may recall from last quarter's call that we had received both an F-35 LRIP 11 UCA as well as the Multi-Year IX buy of Black Hawk helicopters shortly after the second quarter ended. I'm very pleased that with these awards as well as others in the quarter, our backlog increased above the $100 billion mark for the first time. And importantly, our $104 billion backlog level includes only a minimal amount of orders for the potential $8 billion SOF GLSS contract we received in the quarter as we will recognize orders under this IDIQ vehicle only when incrementally added to the contract. Chart 9 provides our updated outlook for the year. We're increasing our outlook for every metric other than the FAS/CAS adjustment. We're increasing our sales outlook by $200 million, and our segment operating profit outlook by $20 million. In our unallocated items, we expect to resolve certain conditions related to a prior year's property sale in the fourth quarter, which will allow us to recognize a previously deferred $200 million gain. And we're recognizing a $20 million improvement in other expenses for the favorable contract resolutions I mentioned earlier. Our operating profit outlook increased by $240 million, reflecting both the increase in segment operating profit and the improvement in unallocated items. With these improvements in our operating profit, we increased our earnings per share outlook by $0.55 to a new outlook of $12.85 to $13.15 per share. Lastly, we are increasing our cash from operations outlook by $200 million to be equal to or greater than $6.2 billion. Chart 10 shows our revised outlook by business area for sales. We're increasing our sales outlook for Space Systems, RMS and Missiles and Fire Control by a collective $550 million due to higher volume expected in all three business areas, while we're lowering our outlook for the Aeronautics business by $350 million based on an updated forecast of subcontractor production cost that will be incurred in 2017. The net result of these changes is the overall increase in sales of $200 million. Turning to chart 11, we show the changes in our segment operating profit outlook for the year. We're increasing our outlook for profit for Aeronautics, Space Systems and Missiles and Fire Control by a collective $35 million, reflecting both improved performance and higher volumes. We're lowering our outlook for profit at RMS, primarily to recognize the performance issue we discussed in our earnings release. The net of these changes is an overall increase of $20 million in our segment operating profit outlook. Chart 12 provides a view of how the new revenue recognition methodology, ASC 606, is expected to affect our 2017 results when that standard becomes effective next year. We expect 2017 sales under the new methodology will be about 2%, or $1 billion lower than the current methodology, while segment operating profit will be comparable under both the old and new methodologies. As a result, we expect our segment operating margin will increase to around 10.3%. We explained the reasons for the changes we expect for 2017 in the bullets on the chart. Under the current revenue recognition standard, about 70% of our sales are already recorded using the cost-to-cost methodology, and we'll have minimal if any change under the new standard. About 30% of our sales are recorded as deliveries occur, and this is where almost all of the impact of the change to the new standard will occur. The main drivers behind the lower sales in 2017 under the new standard are programs where the quantities of deliveries in 2018 will be lower than the quantities of deliveries in 2017. And this occurs primarily with our aircraft programs like the F-16, C-5 and Black Hawk programs. Profit, on the other hand, is comparable under the two standards. We record our profit step-ups based on the same risk retirement events regardless of revenue recognition method, meaning the timing of those step-ups does not change between the two standards. While the timing of the step-ups does not change, the amount of inception to-date cost incurred or cost of goods sold when the step-ups occur does change between those two standards. The effect on our delivery base sales contracts is always to shift sales to the left, as we always incur significant costs before we begin to deliver our products. As a result, some step-ups in 2017 will be applied to higher inception to-date cost, which helps to offset other contracts that had sales and profit shift to prior periods. The combination of all these unique impacts combined to create essentially no change to our profit in 2017 under either methodology. The important takeaway of the chart is that there is no change to the economics of our programs or cash from operations. The only change is to the phasing of sales and earnings recognized under GAAP. We provide our preliminary trend information for 2018 under the new revenue recognition methodology on chart 13. We expect our sales in 2018 will increase about 2% over the restated 2017 level. Segment operating margin is expected to increase to a range of 10.3% to 10.5% next year. Our cash from operations is expected to be equal to or greater than $5 billion after making required pension contributions of $1.6 billion, meaning our cash from operations before making pension contributions is expected to be $400 million higher than it was in 2017. We expect to have share repurchases of equal to or greater than $1 billion, and we expect to retire about $750 million of debt that is maturing next year. Our FAS/CAS outlook for next year is essentially comparable to this year at $860 million. And this outlook is based on interest rates remaining at their current level through year end, which would be 25 basis points lower than when we began this year. It also assumes a 9% return on our plan assets in 2017, holding to the performance we've experienced through the first three quarters, and it maintains our long-term return on assets assumption of a 7.5% return. Turning to chart 14, we've provided an update to both the original and new three-year goals for cash from operations. Our original goal in October of 2014 was to generate $15 billion or more over the years 2015 to 2017 while we experienced what we called a pension funding holiday over those years. I'm pleased that we now expect to generate $16.5 billion over this time period, while absorbing $100 million of pension contributions for Sikorsky that were not envisioned when we developed this goal. In October of last year, we said that our new goal was to generate more than $15 billion for the years 2017 to 2019, even though we expect to have significantly higher required pension contributions over this timeframe than we had during the pension funding holiday timeframe. Based on our expected 2017 cash from operations of $6.2 billion, we now expect to generate more than $16 billion over the 2017 to 2019 timeframe, while contributing a total of $3.3 billion to our pension trust over 2018 and 2019. Finally, we have our summary on chart 15. We're increasing our full year outlook for all key financial metrics. Our record backlog positions us for sustained long-term growth. We'll continue to have robust cash flow even with the higher pension contributions in the future. We'll maintain our balanced approach to cash deployment. And during our earnings call next quarter, we will provide our full year 2018 outlook under the new revenue recognition standard, which is effective for us on January 1. With that, we're ready for your questions. John?
Operator: Thank you. First, we'll go to Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks. Marillyn, Bruce, Greg, good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hi, Rich.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So I have a bit of a two-part question about the guide. I'd like to know, if you could, what your long-term cash from operations guide for greater than $16 billion includes. For example, are you anticipating a restart of the F-16 line, assuming that Greece and Bahrain actually translate to orders? And are you including, for example, the Saudi THAAD order, which I'm assuming would benefit you in 2019? And the second part is just related to what you've been saying about Aeronautics in your opening remarks. You lowered the sales, and I wanted to know if the issues you spoke about maybe caused you – that caused you to lower your guide portends anything about 2018 and why you might be guiding to 2% growth rather than higher.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hey, Rich. Let me take a shot at both of those, I think. So I think the first part of your two-parter was – and good on you to get a two-parter in, by the way. But your first part was cash from operations, $16 billion, is that considered the restart of Greece and Bahrain and maybe Saudi THAAD, if I caught the question right. So I think the short answer is it includes the effect of all those in our cash from operations outlook. And I think maybe the heart of your question is whether or not there could be some upside. For instance, if THAAD were to happen sooner than maybe we have it planned or not, or if Greece and Bahrain might happen sooner. I think the short answer to that is I wouldn't expect to see a lot of upside improvement, because none of those are on a DCS or direct commercial sale basis. So there is no sort of down payment associated with that. All those will be FMS payments. And at least for the start of those contracts, I would expect most if not all of those to be under progress payments. So, if anything, we've probably got a little cash usage in the near-term associated with winning those new orders as opposed to cash benefit. You talked about 2019. By that time, Rich, the cash should start to turn around, and we would start to expect to see some positive cash come out of those orders, I would expect, during that timeframe. And next I think was the question on F-35 sales and lowering the outlook for this year, and what does that portend for next year. I'm going to give you probably a longer than maybe even necessary response, Rich, to the question because I think that's an important question. I'm glad you asked it upfront there. So I think the very short answer is, no. I don't think that portends anything for 2018 sales for F-35. I think we're looking at about 16% sales growth in F-35 sales in 2017 over 2016. And as I look forward to 2018, there's still another mid-single-digit – or 13% probably to 15% growth range in F-35 sales in 2018. So still very, very significant growth. In fact, if you take a look at the F-35 growth in the quarter, it's up 20% over the third quarter of last year. So that program is growing at pretty good leaps and bounds. And so I think that sort of begs the question so why the lowering of the outlook for F-35? And it's a little bit of a complicated answer, so let me try to get into that. First off, we're not in a steady state on the F-35 program. As I just said, we are growing at a very, very significant rate. And I'll just tell you, it's a lot easier to forecast steady build programs where you're incurring the same costs year-to-year, the same number of deliveries year-to-year. It's much, much harder to forecast when you're either increasing rate or decreasing rate, as we are with the F-35. And at any given calendar year, we probably have at least three LRIPs with significant costs incurred in each of those LRIPs all at the same time. And, more importantly, our suppliers amount of probably 65% or 70% of the total cost in each LRIP. And you should think of that as hundreds of thousands of suppliers – hundreds to thousands, not hundreds of thousands, for each LRIP. And, frankly, we missed the phasing of this supplier cost this year. I think it's important to note that this does not impact the production of aircraft. It's just the timing of when we expected suppliers to incur their cost or bill their cost to us. We're actually not missing the phasing on our internal costs. We are just missing the phasing of our supplier cost. And this doesn't change our overall expectations of cost by LRIP or the profitability by LRIPs, simply the phasing of cost by year. And in a weird kind of way we actually know the at-completion cost for each LRIP probably better than we know when it's going to be phased by year. So, obviously, Rich, we've got to get this dialed in better with our supply chain costs going forward. We think we're going to do that. We think we have the process in place to do that. I will tell you there's a twist coming up this year and probably next year – or 2018 and probably 2019, though, which is the economic order quantity that we expect to start incurring costs on actually this year, and into next year, and 2019, and beyond. We're forecasting it's also going to present a bit of a challenge, because there we're actually buying for three LRIPs simultaneously versus three LRIPs uniquely, like our historical data represents. So not trying to over complicate things, hopefully, for you, Rich, but just to give you an appreciation for why we don't think that's a long-term issue with the F-35. It doesn't change the economics of the F-35 program. We simply missed the phasing in 2017 of our supplier cost.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hey, Rob.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Maybe just to follow-up on Rich's question there, Bruce. When you're talking about costs, this is because these are cost-plus programs, right? And, therefore, these get passed on with revenues, and that's why the revenues in the third quarter weren't as you'd originally guided? Is that correct?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Let me correct you a little bit, Rich (sic) [Rob]. You should think of almost all the F-35 as fixed price incentive, firm contracts, not cost plus, but they're all recognized under a POC cost-to-cost if that might have been your question, method of sales recognition, versus a delivery based.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And then how does that flow through to the operating margin? Is this that the revenue is slipped to the right? You therefore can't book them in the quarter. They will be recognized in the fourth quarter when these costs are incurred. Is that correct?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: That's exactly right, Rob.
Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Glad I got that cleared up. And then just finally on the cash guide that you've given for 2017, 2018 and 2019, how much of that change is coming from the adjustment to 2017 versus the out-years in 2018 and 2019?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: So most of it is coming from 2017, Rob. I'll say, with the improved performance that we've seen this year, I think, we're up, what, $500 million or so this year over what we initially guided towards. So when we came out with that guidance at the beginning of the year, I think, there was always some confusion, at least as I met with investors and talked to some of the analysts myself, as to was our cash going to sort of fall off the face of the earth when we started making some fairly large pension contributions. And there, I'm pleased to say that even with those, we still think we can stay at the $5 billion plus level in the years 2018 and 2019. So most of the change occurred in the upper first 2017 performance but I did want to give the indication that still strong cash performance, especially if you consider sort of pre-pension cash flow, our numbers are increasing every year, 2017, 2018, all the way through2019.
Operator: Our next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey. Thank you. Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Marillyn, can you talk about maybe what you think went wrong with the GBSD down-select and maybe what some of the lessons learned that you guys took from that bidding process? Thank you.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Well, I would just say that, on GBSD, we thought we had a very strong offering and we still believe we had a strong offering. So in terms of any lessons learned from that, we always reflect on why we lost a program. We always go through lessons learned process, but I don't think there's anything specifically that I would pass on to you at this point.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Nothing specific about that program or any questions you may have about the overall sort of bidding process for Lockheed in general going forward? That was just sort of isolated?
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yes. I mean, I think we still have a chance to participate in other elements of that program going forward. So we're still hopeful in that regard. We have a lot of capability to bring to our customer.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. That's it for me.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Next we'll go to Peter Arment with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce. Bruce, maybe just a quick one on kind of you just highlighted the F-35 growth year-over-year kind of talking about 2018. I think you said 13% to 15%. And I know you kind of highlighted F-16, C-5, Black Hawks will be down. So it kind of implies that there's not a lot of growth from the rest of the portfolio, which seems kind of unrealistic. But maybe you could just highlight what some of the moving parts are around when we're thinking about the top line growth rates in.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yes. So I know it's a lot of moving parts and probably a lot of confusion, Peter, because we're basing our sales growth next year based on restated 2017 numbers where we've not given and you haven't seen that laid out by business area. So it's a little bit of explaining something kind of on faith at this point in time, frankly, because you don't have the data in front of you. We'll obviously provide some restated 2017 performance based under the new revenue recognition when we present our data in the January timeframe. But given that, what we're looking at is Arrow's probably going to be up in, I would think, high single-digits sales next year. And obviously most of that is driven by the F-35 program. That's helping to offset both lower F-35 development costs. Although the F-35 development program continues, it's dropping probably a $0.25 billion year-over-year. So that's a pretty good headwind for us. And, as you said, obviously, we've got the lower C-5. What you didn't mention is we've also got next year zero F-16 deliveries. We've just got to start on hopefully the Bahrain aircraft there, but actually lower F-16 volume next year for production aircraft than we have in 2017. Missiles and Fire Control, I'll say, has slight growth over 2017. Again, these are all relative to sort of the restated 2017 numbers under the new revenue recognition, but you should think of that as sort of low-single-digit growth. And I think where that may be a little surprising is given all the discussion we've had about the potential THAAD awards, especially with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and others, really that work is not planned in our outlook to start until the middle of next year. And that's a pretty slow build-up of costs relative to our supply chain on the THAAD program. So even though the numbers are very, very large, they really don't amount to just a huge amount of sales growth in 2018 versus 2017. RMS next year is about comparable probably as our current outlook for 2017 where we have LCS volume, including, by the way, the LCS ships for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is the only program of the ones that were announced where we've actually received some funding and we're starting to do some design work and so forth on the LCS variants for use in that ship by the KSA. And that's helping to offset really lower Black Hawk aircraft deliveries and volume therefore for next year as we talked about in our prepared remarks. And, lastly, Space Systems is probably down mid-single-digits. You should think of that as sort of the continuing trend of lower government satellite volume both for SBIRS and Advanced EHF. And, again, this is sort of the good news/bad news story where we have the same quantity of satellites that we're producing, because we're now in the fifth and six variants – or fifth and six quant number of SBIRS and Advanced EHF, we're making each one of them for less than the previous satellite. So, while the quantities stay the same, the pricing is coming down, and that's a good thing for us, by the way. And then that's – so that's a big piece of it. The other piece of it is literally there's very, very little commercial satellite volume or much, much lower commercial satellite volume in 2018 compared to 2017 as we wrap up two satellites that we'll deliver out in the early stages of 2018. So that's kind of the around-the-horn pieces, Peter, of what's driving the sales volume that I talked about in total at the corporation level.
Operator: Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hey, Noah.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Bruce, so if I take the 2% organic revenue growth 2018, I take the little bit of segment margin expansion, kind of gets in the zone of a couple hundred million bucks of segment EBIT growth 2018 versus 2017. It looks like that will basically be offset by the Other line where you've got some favorable items this year that don't recur. So it sort of looks like total EBIT gets in the zone of flat. And then if I assume the tax rate is probably a little higher because you had a few favorable tax rate quarters, share count is maybe 3 million or 4 million shares lower based on the buyback guidance you gave today. Those kind of roughly offset. It sort of has me – it sort of has the model just showing 2018 earnings kind of close to flat versus the updated 2017 guidance; maybe a little bit of growth. And I guess the reason I'm going through that and asking that is I'm staring at the consensus number that's over $14. Obviously you always have some contingency in your margin guidance. You might buy back more stock. But I'm just wondering if I'm missing anything in – at least where you're going to start the 2018 outlook, looking relatively close to flat on an earnings basis?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yes. Noah, look, I think your math is actually pretty close to what I'm looking at. I think the one piece you didn't mention in all of that, and I don't know what you have in your model and I don't know what the other folks have in their models, but I'd be surprised if you have a FAS/CAS outlook of $860 million for next year. That's actually a little bit lower than this year. We incorporated the 25 basis point reduction that we saw through the end of the first three quarters in the numbers. I'm personally hopeful that we have an uptick in interest rates between now and the end of the year and maybe that goes away. But as we sit here right now, that's down considerably from at least what we were expecting the FAS/CAS to look like in 2018 compared to the $860 million. So that's a pretty good chunk I think of the difference from sort of the EPS numbers you were mentioning there. I think the absolute segment profit and the operating profit numbers you were talking about are probably pretty close to what we're expecting to see.
Operator: Next we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hi, Rob.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So Bruce, for you, going back to the 2%, and I suppose this addresses some of what's already been discussed, but you've got this book-to-bill of 1.2. At some point there's a nice sales inflection up, so I'd like to talk about when that's coming; what your timeframe is for that? And then in the backlog, is that $104 billion a gross number or a net number? Is there any dead backlog in there that is pressuring sales that needs to come out?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: If I understand the last part of your question, the answer is no. I mean, the $104 billion is backlog just like any other backlog number we would have presented to you at any point in time, Rob, so no to that question. Your book-to-bill question, the 1.2 and the $104 billion, the record number we had in the third quarter, and I think your question in a nutshell is so why doesn't that translate into higher growth in 2018 than just the 2% we're talking about?
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes. Or when does it?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yes. So I think, Rob, we do typically sort of three-ish year plans. And if you take a look here, which you can't, but if you look beyond 2018 into 2019 and 2020, we're probably in the 4.5%, 5% CAGR level for each of those two years over the 2018 numbers. So I think that's where, you know, some of that at least growth occurs. But some of the opportunities within the $104 billion and some of the opportunities that aren't in the $104 billion, such as the $15 billion of KSA – I'm sorry, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia order for the THAAD program, for instance, that Marillyn referenced in her remarks, even when that gets in backlog, that's a long cycle program, so it will take a while. Even though we're recording that on a cost-to-cost basis, it's still a long duration, long cycle program. So that was the point we were trying to make the comments about. This does really, really well position us for future growth for a long, sustained period of time. It just doesn't happen overnight, and especially if you will allow me to call 2018 overnight. And the other prospect that we've got long-term sustained growth for is the 53K, and it's got one of the slowest starts on a program that large that I have ever seen. I mean, we're literally talking two aircraft in the LRIP 1 contract. I think it grows to four in the next one. I mean, it's a very, very, very slow growth rate. So that's one we'd love to get some higher growth coming out of there. But that's the reason why I think, Rob, it looks a little like maybe compared to what you were expecting in 2018. I think it starts to pick up probably to where your expectations are much more in 2019 and 2020.
Operator: Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hey, Jason.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Bruce, I was wondering if you could do the same thing that you did on revenues by segment and talk about the operating profit outlook as we move out into 2018 and discuss kind of the puts and takes by segment?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yes. I can give a shot at that, Jason. Again, this is all a little bit maybe taken on faith, since this is new revenue recognition when year heads and all of their modeling is based on the old revenue recognitions. But this will be how we come out with numbers in January of next year. So, maybe just starting with the same order as I did I think earlier going around the horn. I think for Aeronautics, you should expect our ROS probably in the upper 10% range, probably pretty comparable to this year. I'm very happy to say that the F-35 program we're expecting to be greater than 10% our overall program margin in 2018. And that's helping to offset really lower C-5 and primarily F-16 earnings, which led to margin growth due to higher risk retirements in 2017. But upper 10s is probably a good spot, frankly, for Aeronautics. And about what we've been saying for a number of years is that when we saw the F-35 program start to get to double-digit, we'd start to see Aeronautics get back to closer to where it was margin wise a few years ago. So we're sort of right at that cusp here. For Missiles and Fire Control, probably about – you should think of about a mid-teens sort of ROS, maybe slightly below the 2017 level. And I think that's an interesting one, because I don't think it's easily understood just how many new wins we have, in fact, won out of our Missile and Fire Control business. I mean, if I just go around the horn, Marillyn mentioned the Long Range Stand Off, sort of, the next-generation nuclear cruise missile. We also won the F-15 IRST. We won a large classified contract. We won the SOF GLSS we talked about. We won the ARTS – I believe it's ARTS 2D (sic) [ARTS-V2], which is sort of a radar threat emitter contract. I mean, these are all substantive starts, new starts for us. I mean, just to give you some idea there. We're in the process of hiring 1,000 engineers for these new programs that we won in 2017. So that's great from a long-term prospect for us, but it sort of hurts the margin in the near-term. And that's what keeps us sort of at the level that I just talked about. RMS, if you look at the EBIT or the ROS for next year, probably slightly higher than 2017. I'd say maybe in the mid-7%, maybe a little higher than that range in 2018. And then for Space Systems, I think, it's slightly higher than 2017. And that's primarily because we have less commercial satellite volume in 2018 than we did in 2017. And that's essentially at a zero margin business. So, as I said earlier, we've got two satellites that should deliver in the early to mid-part of 2018, so there's just simply less cost volume at that lower margin rate in 2018 than 2017, which helps the 2018 margin. And, importantly, I think, just to mention ULA, the equity earnings are pretty comparable between 2017 and 2018. I know I just gave you a lot, Jason. Hopefully that answers your question and makes sense to you.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Marillyn, you talked earlier about the challenges in the budget process right now. And if you look at the House – what House appropriations has come up with and look where the Senate and the House authorization bills have gone, you're looking at high double-digit growth in the investment account. And if you contrast that with a CR at present with the BCA cap, say, you're looking at scenarios for 2018 that are very far apart. And what I'm interested in is when you plan going forward and you think about what your revenue growth will be and also what your investments are, how do you manage this uncertainty? In other words, what's the range of outcomes here and when will we expect to see an impact one way or another on your revenues and earnings?
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks for the question, Doug. I guess the first thing I would say is that we have a number of programs that are programs of record that are well supported in both the House and the Senate's bills. So if you look at that and you look at where we are, our programs today – as Bruce was talking about, our long-cycle programs that are already under contract that we're working through. So even with the CR, we're not going to see any immediate impact. What it affects is if it extends into next year and I'm actually feeling pretty optimistic that it's not going to do that. I think when I look at where the bipartisan support for defense and the move to try to get through this budget so they can move on to tax reform and other things, I feel pretty good about that. In terms of – you look at our portfolio, I mean, when we are – last year, about 27% of our portfolio was international. We're growing to over 30%. That's also another element that you have to take into account. We are not totally reliant on the U.S. government budget for our growth going forward. And then as I just think about where the – if you look at the programs that are supported in the current budget bills from both the House and the Senate, we are really well supported on virtually across our portfolio. So I'm very happy with our portfolio. We're continuing to win business. You heard Bruce and I talk about several things that we've just won in the past quarter and, of course, the F-35 continues to grow and be well supported. So I'm pretty – I feel pretty bullish about our portfolio and where we're going. Even if we were to face additional budget caps, we know for the long term that's something that we've been a strong voice on the hill about – of trying to get our lawmakers to address the budget caps. And they are all – everyone I speak to understands that and they're focused on it. I think we're going to have a chance to do that. The time is now. So hopefully that answers your question, Doug.
Operator: Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. Bruce, I guess, I'll maybe keep you on your toes a little bit. In terms of the cash guide for this year at that $6.2 billion and thinking about the pension headwind, but if the pension contribution is offset a little bit by higher CAS and then you think about it after tax, it seems like maybe it should be about $1 billion headwind all in. And then maybe there's still a few $100 million of Sikorsky working capital relief. Can you highlight maybe any other moving pieces to think about as we move from cash flow in 2017 to 2018?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Actually, Seth, I think you pretty much nailed it. I think you've got the right numbers in your head and that's sort of the way I think about it as well. I don't think I've got a whole lot to add other than what you said.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then anything – you could meet your guidance for 2017 and 2018 and then the implied cash for 2019 is below $5 billion. With growth accelerating, there's no reason to expect cash to decline in2019, right?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yes. And, honestly, we weren't trying to indicate that. I think if you look at the chart in the web charts that we provided it said greater than $16.2 billion. And we tried to indicate that included $6.2 billion in 2017 and at least $5 billion each in 2018 and 2019. So we weren't trying to guide to a lower than $5 billion number in 2019.
Operator: Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for the time. Bruce, a question for you. Obviously you came out with your trending data for 2018. That's a bit light versus expectations. Why not use pension pre-funding as an opportunity to maybe offset some of those headwinds and maybe improve the outlook as far as earnings and/or cash flow?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yeah. Rajeev, first off, welcome to the call. Nice to have you on board. Look, we've looked at pension a lot of ways. I mean, we're already funded in advance of what the requirements of our pension plan to the tune of about $7 billion, almost $8 billion or so. We are well ahead of the game in terms of pension funding. I mean, we look at that constantly. And I'll tell you I know I've said this when I've talked to investors in various conferences and so forth. If in fact tax reform is initiated, we will clearly look at potentially accelerating our pension contributions, even if it requires taking out some debt to do so, simply because at the numbers we're talking about, let's just for argument's sake say it is actually a 20% statutory corporate tax rate versus 35%. That equates to real money when you get the benefit of the 35% deduction on your pension contributions versus a 20%. So we would clearly want to accelerate some in that regard if, in fact, tax reform happens. Short of that, I mean, unless there's maybe some – we have a couple of fairly significant collections associated with some international contracts right on the cusp of this year, 2017, that could slip into 2018. Depending on the timing of when those things happen, whether it's late December or slips into next year, if all of them happen and we get hit on the head with horseshoes in 2017, we might actually make a – try to get a dent in our pension contributions this year, which, of course, would lower our pension contributions next year sort of dollar for dollar. But that's sort of the only thing we're thinking about as we sit here today. But in any event, still, I would expect to achieve the $6.2 billion of cash from operations this year. If anything, on top of that, we might actually look at that as an opportunity to bring down or draw down the pension contribution, that $1.6 billion in 2018.
Greg M. Gardner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hey, John. This is Greg. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: That will come from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Can I just follow-up on some of those last couple questions with regards to pension? And I know you're not guiding 2018 let alone 2019. But 2018, 2019 $10 billion cash from operations, there are a lot of reasons why next year is relatively below your 3% to 5% long-term growth. But shouldn't that recover in terms of revenues in 2019? It would just seem like there isn't a lot that would be a headwind. If anything, you should do better in 2019 than 2018 from a cash perspective. In terms of if you can somehow talk about either the pension contributions from 2018 to 2019 as you think about it and the CapEx trends, just so we can think about that in terms of free cash flow.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yes. So we talked about, Sam, the pension contributions. We've teed up $1.6 million this year. We've said it's $3.3 billion over 2018 and 2019, which would imply a $1.7 billion required contribution in 2019. So that is increasing a little bit there. I'll tell you I don't like as a daily course to provide three-year guidance on much of anything. So we want to make sure when we talk those numbers, those are something that we can actually achieve. So I hope there's opportunity to do better than that. If you looked at the last three-year goal we did better than what we came out with in the early, what was it, 2014 timeframe. We've just got to make that happen. And we'll see what's going on in that regard for the next couple of years. We do have a little bit of higher capital expenditures over the next couple of years, which – I don't know if that's something you'd be considering, but probably $100 million to $150 million, maybe $200 million at its peak higher than this year. And you should think of a lot of that as some of the new business wins we've just had at Missiles and Fire Control that I'd talked about requires some capital improvements and some additional facilities and equipment there. And you may have seen that we're also building a fairly large facility out of our Space Systems company in Denver to accommodate greater capacity and greater sized satellites going forward, because we think that's where the market is headed. So sort of those higher pension a little bit, more than in 2018, and maybe a little bit of CapEx is some of the headwind that we're seeing. But other than that, I think it should sort of follow suit, as you said.
Greg M. Gardner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: John, this is Greg. I think we've come up on the top of the hour here. So I will turn it back over to Marillyn for final thoughts.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thank you again for joining us on the call today. I want to end by reiterating that the corporation had another solid quarter. And with our strong portfolio and robust backlog, we continue to be well-positioned to deliver substantial value to our customers and to our stockholders. John, that concludes our call today. Thank you.
Operator: You're welcome. And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our second quarter results and our increased outlook for 2017. As today's release illustrates, we had strong results this quarter, operationally and financially. Our strong year to date financial performance also enabled us to increase our full year 2017 guidance for sales, operating profit, and earnings per share. These results reflect a high level of execution being achieved across our businesses in providing critical products and services to our customers while returning outstanding value to stockholders. It is particularly noteworthy that our quarterly cash flows exceeded last year's second quarter by nearly $200 million when we adjust for the $125 million of IS&GS cash that was included in the 2016 results.  Our team continues to progress toward our full year objective in growth in sales, EPS, and cash from operations, and I thank our team for their dedication to our mission. Chris will cover the financial results in detail a little later. However, I want to touch on two events which occurred after our accounting quarter closed that point to the strength of our portfolio and the significant growth opportunities they provide. First, in our Rotary and Mission Systems business area, our Sikorsky line of business secured a $3.8 billion, five year contract for 257 Black Hawk helicopters to be delivered to the US Army, as well as to the Saudi Arabian National Guard. This award marks Sikorsky’s ninth multiple year contract with the US government and includes options for an additional 103 aircraft, bringing the potential value to over $5 billion. We are honored to have the opportunity to continue providing rotary aircraft in support of the important missions of the US Army and our international customer.  Second, our Aeronautics business area received an F-35 award on LRIP 11, which includes funding for 74 US jets and totaled nearly $5.6 billion. This brings the total quantity of US aircraft authorized for LRIP 11 to 91 planes, a growth of 36 fighter jets from LRIP 10 US government order, and represents a 65% increase from the prior lot. We anticipate a separate order - a separate award later this quarter, which will add additional aircraft for our international F-35 partners and foreign military sales customers. The recent US award demonstrates continued evidence of the strong support the F-35 has earned, and we look forward to finalizing these contracts as we progress to full rate production.  Turning briefly to Defense budgets, the FY17 DOD budget appropriations have been enacted and were consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement of 2015, bringing Defense Department base budget funding to approximately $524 billion, as well as overseas contingency operations funding to about $83 billion. We’re pleased to see that our programs continue to be well supported, as seen by the legislation increasing F-35 aircraft and Black Hawk helicopter quantities. The higher levels for both the base and OCO budgets, reflect a growing level of bipartisan recognition of rising global security threats and the need for additional budget resources. The additional funding for FY17 will help begin to address some of the acute budget needs to recapitalize our defense assets and respond to the global security environment.  Also, the president released his request for the FY18 DOD budget. This included $574 billion for the base budget, an increase of nearly 10% from the FY17 appropriations and 3% from the prior presidential base budget submission. Additionally, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, have released their fiscal year ’18 National Defense Authorization Act markups, both of which greatly exceeded the president's request. And the House has since passed their version by a wide margin. While we recognize - while we realize that these proposals exceed the current budget caps, we are encouraged to see the recognition that our defense budgets require increased levels of funding. We are hopeful that bipartisan agreement can be reached to rescind or modify the budget caps and fund our military at the levels needed to address the current set of world threats.  Moving on, I'd like to highlight several operational successes we achieved on our F-35 program, and then briefly comment on the recent historic announcements from the US and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia governments to bolster global security. The program featured two milestones that highlight the growing international nature of the Joint Strike Fighter. The first Japanese assembled F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant, was unveiled at the Final Assembly and Checkout or FACO facility in Nagoya, Japan. This aircraft marks the first of nearly 40 jets that will be produced for the Japanese Ministry of Defense at this location.  Similarly, the first F-35B variant to be assembled outside the United States, was rolled out in Italy from the Cameri FACO facility. Cameri has already delivered multiple F-35A versions and is slated to produce over 100 aircraft in total. Together, these two events underscore the benefits of the multinational partnerships that have been forged as we work to provide fifth generation capabilities to both US and coalition forces.  Keeping with the F-35 program, we were also proud to spotlight our F-35A at the Paris Air Show last month. The CTOL variant performed its inaugural aerial demonstration, showcasing its aerobatic maneuvering and the jet’s raw power to climb and run. I watched, along with the rest of the amazed crowd, at the Le Bourget Airport as the aircraft flawlessly executed 90 degree climbs, remarkable angle of attack displays, and several unique moves that only a fifth generation fighter could accomplish, all of which shine a bright light on the impressive capabilities this unrivaled stealth fighter provides. As the crowd erupted into applause, I could not have been more proud of what our Lockheed Martin team, together with the US government, the JPO organization, international partners, industry teammates, and hundreds of suppliers have been able to accomplish.  Before I conclude, I'd like to take a moment to say a few words about the unprecedented announcements that President Trump and his majesty King Salman of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, made in Riyadh in May. As part of those announcements, the kingdom expressed its intent to procure more than $28 billion worth of Lockheed Martin products and services, including air and missile defense products such as THAAD batteries and PAC-3 missiles, Multi-Mission Surface Combatant Ships, variants of our Littoral Combat Ship, C-130J aircraft and various other defense related capabilities and solutions. These announcements reflect the strength of the relationship that our corporation has built with the kingdom over the past 50 years. In addition, the request touched each of our four business areas, demonstrating the breadth and depth of our offerings and the growth potential that our portfolio brings. Finally, I would like to acknowledge our Space Systems team, as they mark the one year anniversary of the Juno spacecraft orbiting the planet Jupiter. Images from the Juno orbiter graced the cover of the May issue of Science Magazine, delivering breathtaking views of the giant planet’s polar region. The mission also included measurements of the magnetic and gravitational fields and unique perspectives on the atmospheric and weather environments of Jupiter's surface. Scientists are excited at the initial in depth results being provided, as well as with the potential new discoveries that may be made in the upcoming experiments. We believe our continuous commitment to innovation and our long term partnership with NASA have contributed to these remarkable achievements and we are proud to be a part of this ambitious undertaking.  I’ll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your question. 
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn and good morning everyone. I'll be making remarks based on the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let’s begin with chart three and an overview of our results. We’re pleased with our performance in the quarter. Sales of $12.7 billion were slightly ahead of our expectations and showed solid growth over last year's results. Our operating profit and earnings per share results were also ahead of our expectations, while cash from operations was in line with what we were expecting. We continued our strong cash deployment actions and we increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit and earnings per share. So we had a very solid second quarter and a nice rebound from some of the performance issues we had in the first quarter.  On chart four we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the second quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were $1.1 billion higher this quarter compared with the last year, with most of that growth coming from the Aeronautics and Space Systems business areas. Aeronautics growth was driven by higher volume from the F-35 and C-130 programs, and an additional C-5 delivery this quarter compared with last year. Space Systems growth was driven by the inclusion of the atomic weapons establishment sales in the quarter compared with none in the second quarter of last year. Segment operating profit was $55 million higher this quarter compared to last year. This was driven by higher volume and improved performance of the F-35 program and Aeronautics, improved performance across multiple lines of business within RMS, and these were partially offset by lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance and Space Systems.  Turning to chart five, we’ll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. EPS from continuing operations of $3.23, was about 10% higher than the results from a year ago, reflecting both higher operating earnings and lower share count this year compared with last year.  On chart six we'll compare our cash from operations this quarter versus our results from 2016. We generated more than $1.5 billion of cash in the quarter, over $70 million more than we did in the second quarter of last year. But as Marillyn said in her remarks, that understates our relative performance as last year's results included around $125 million of cash generated by IS&GS, which was not divested until August of last year. On a year to date basis, our $3.2 billion of cash generated, is also about $70 million higher than our results from the first half of 2016, but last year's amount included nearly $300 million of cash generated by IS&GS.  Chart seven shows the cash returns to stockholders in the quarter. Subtracting capital expenditures in the quarter from our cash from operations, our free cash flow was just under $1.3 billion, and we returned slightly more than $1 billion to stockholders, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. This cash deployment represents 81% of our free cash flow in the quarter.  On chart eight, we want to make you aware of two large awards that took place shortly after the end of the quarter that are not reflected in our reported backlog level. The largest award was for the F-35 LRIP 11 UCA for domestic aircraft that Marillyn mentioned and was worth $5.6 billion. The second award was for the multi-year IX by Black Hawk helicopters and was worth $3.8 billion. Both of these awards occurred within two weeks after the quarter close and their combined values would have pushed our backlog above $100 billion for the quarter had they occurred just a few days earlier.  Chart nine provides our updated outlook for the year. We increased sales by $300 million, with all of that increase coming from the Space Systems business due to the higher volume we're seeing this year. We increased segment operating profit by $35 million, with $20 million of the increase coming from our Aeronautics business and $15 from Space Systems. Aeronautics increase recognizes better than planned performance so far this year, while the Space Systems increase is primarily volume driven. We had an improvement in our unallocated costs worth $25 million, driven mostly by a reduction to a previously established reserve. While these improvements in our - with these improvements in our operating profit, we increased our earnings per share by $0.15. And lastly, we’re maintaining our cash from operations outlook at equal to or greater than $6 billion.  Charts 10 and 11 show our revised outlooks by business area for both sales and segment operating profit. I covered the revisions in the outlook in the prior discussions.  Chart 12 provides a reconciliation of our prior EPS outlook to our current outlook. The $35 million increase in segment operating profit, increases our expected EPS by about $0.10, while the $25 million decrease in unallocated expense, improves the EPS by around $0.05, resulting in a revised outlook for the year of $12.30 to $12.60. This new range is higher than the guidance we provided when we began this year, more than offsetting the setbacks we experienced in the first quarter.  Finally, we have our summary on chart 13. Our quarter results for sales, profit, EPS and cash from operation, were all either in line or ahead of our expectations. That resulted in the increased outlook that we just discussed. We are well positioned to achieve our full year goals and as we look ahead to the third quarter earnings call, we'll provide our initial trend information for 2018. As a reminder, the new revenue recognition rule will be effective for us starting in January and will be incorporated into our trend information. With that, we're ready for your questions. John?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. First, we go to the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning. Bruce, always a lot of focus on the cash flow, and there's been a lot of discussion about the capital spending at various defense contracts. Your CapEx is certainly up over the last few years, and up year-over-year. How should we think about that in future years? And what's going to dictate that? Is this F-35 volume or the contract wins or losses like TX? What’s going to dictate kind of the levels of CapEx we see over the next few years?
Bruce Tanner: Sam, thanks for that question. It’s a good question. As we looked at our long range planning from last year, that covers basically 2017, ’18, and ’19, 2017 is sort of a peak in terms of the capital expenditures for the corporation. And that reflects a number of things, some restructuring that we're doing within our Space Systems business, moving some of the work around within locations, within Space Systems, and it also reflects the last tranche of investments required to get the F-35 sort of fully capitalized. It increased in, I’ll say between 2015 and maybe years prior to going forward because we added Sikorsky into the portfolio, which obviously has higher capital expenditure requirements than did the IS&GS business, which really had practically immaterial capital expenditure requirements. So if you start to sort of think of 2017 as sort being the high point, at least as we look at it today, going forward we would expect that number to slightly decrease going forward and within that slight decrease going forward, there are some requirements for additional new capital for some of the wins, one of which you described in your question, but that's sort of more than offset by the reductions in the other capital expenditures required, including F-35.
Operator: Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Noah Poponak: Hey, good morning everyone. Bruce, how should we think about Aeronautics' organic revenue growth in 2018? Just because now you are going to have a pretty tough just growth comparison. You’ll have more F-35 growth, but you had mentioned before other aircraft in the segment being headwinds, not sure if those have moved around. And then if you could just perhaps tie that into - a few quarters ago, you talked about staying in the 3% to 5% total Company growth range, but 2018 maybe being at the low end of that. Just wanted to check back in if that was still sort of the case. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Noah. So Aero’s organic growth, I think what I said previously or what you said that I said previously in earlier quarters, still is true today. We're still looking - I’ll probably answer your second question first. We're still looking at the total company, about the 3% to 5% growth going forward, and’18 is a little less than that and actually in ’19, as we sit here today, it probably picks back up. And a lot of that is because as - to your first question, in 2018, we're actually seeing a drop off because we have the end of the F-16 production line, at least based on current orders at the end of our - close to the end of 2017. We have no new production F-16s planned for 2018 as we sit here today, and that's not in the numbers that we've talked about previously. We also have the end of the C-5 program in the early part of 2018, and so those two events are kind of bringing down Aeronautics organic growth. You’re still seeing tremendous growth potential in both the production and sustainment programs for Aeronautics for the F-35 program, but the other two are slightly, as I said, dissipating some of that growth. And that's one of the reasons why in 2019 we kind of bounce back as we're operating off of a lower compare, if you will, in 2018. 
Operator: Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel: Thank you very much. I want to change a little bit from operations, talk strategy for a moment, and there's two things related. One, Marillyn, you've started to make some investments outside of your core that look like they are complementary, and maybe you could address that and talk about how significant a commitment it could be. And then related to that is, from a longer-term point of view, you have to think about people and what are going on there, and how do you think about succession planning?
Marillyn Hewson: Excellent questions, Howard. Things that I - both of which I have spent a lot of time on, on a regular basis. So thank you for the question. From the strategy standpoint, our focus is on growth. We've been very clear about that. We think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to grow. We see our international growth increasing from what today is about 20 - in 2016 was about 27% of our sales, 30% and we’ll continue to see that growth. The demand around the world is high for not only F-35, but missile defense. One of our F-16 C-130s, other defensive systems that we have, as well as our opportunities in space based situational awareness, et cetera. So that growth, we have been - in terms of your comment about outside our core, the complementary, I would say that our commercial satellites, our commercial helicopters, those that we’re doing with the LM-100J, which is the commercial version of the C-130, those are absolutely areas to move in commercial but very closely aligned. And then of course the hybrid airship is another opportunity for us. So those all are in line with our core competences and our capabilities, but moving into similar - more into the commercial space and aligning with that. Long term, we're always focused on our talent management, our talent development. It is an ongoing part of our business. And in terms of succession planning, as you look at the leadership team that we have at Lockheed Martin, very seasoned, very strong, talented team that is - that I'm really proud to be a part of the team and working collectively with them on how we’re executing our strategy for the corporation. But at all times we’re looking at building that pipeline of talent into the business. And yes, we also look at that talent from the standpoint of its diversity. And so I'm proud to say that 21% of our leaders are women and we continue to bring more talent in from that regard. So succession planning is something that we continue to look at as a company and it's an ongoing effort for us. Thanks for the question. 
Operator: And next we go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Rob Spingarn: Good morning. I wanted to ask, as you go into next year, and we think about - going back to the cash flow, Sam asked about the CapEx. And you talked I think at the tail end of last quarter, about trying to - ex-pension contribution, perhaps cash flow could be - operating cash flow could be flattish with this year. Bruce, does that still work with the multi-year on the Black Hawk and the quantity adjustments that are happening there? And any other new incremental information that we have since last time? 
Bruce Tanner: I think the answer is no. it doesn't change, Rob as far as our thinking is concerned relative to the way you've described 2018. Sans pension contribution, I would expect operating cash flow for the corporation to look pretty similar to this year. And again we talked about, after those pension contributions both in 2018 and 2019, but if you add the cash from those years along with 2017, we expect to be in excess of $15 billion. We're off to a great start obviously this year in 2017 and we’ll give you more insight into what we're looking for ’18 and maybe a little beyond as we talk to you on the next quarter call. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ron Epstein: Good morning guys. I just want to maybe talk about some business opportunities, the first of which would be the TX and JSTARS. How's that going and when would you expect a decision made on those?
Marillyn Hewson: Sure. I’ll take those. We’re looking at where the Air Force is and TX and JSTARS, they’re looking at - they’ve set an award in the fourth quarter of this year. Obviously we never know until they actually do it, and so we couldn't say, but that's what they've outlined is the fourth quarter of 2017 for JSTARS and TX. And then we see some other near term awards that we're hoping to see in September, October timeframe, ones like the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services that we’re unencumbered on that today and us being - it’s in competition and we hope to see that award. It’s got total program value with options of up to $8 billion. Our Ground Based Strategic Defense is another one that we would look to have to see an award coming here in the fourth quarter. And we're hoping as we look at the Saudi operations, the opportunity that we have there that potentially we could see a fat award sometime late in the year, early next year.  And then another would be LRSO, the Long-Range Standoff Missile. That is also looking at September timeframe. And let’s see. Another would be, the Saudis are looking at getting the search and rescue and S70i helicopter award that we expect in September timeframe as well. So several awards in the near term. I think I rattled off six or seven of them just there. And so we're excited. And Bruce, you have some other thoughts?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Just maybe one to address the question of the star - the start of your question, Ron. You should think of most of these as we've already submitted the proposals. So you sort of ask, what's the status? Well, the status is I think we're all sort of waiting and for the most part, the government is evaluating ours along with everyone else's proposal, and we sit anxiously waiting to see the results of that. but there's not much we can do at this point as I said because almost every one of the ones that Marillyn - if not all of them, that Marillyn just rattled off for - we've already submitted the proposals for those. 
Operator: Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. 
Finbar Sheehy: Hi. It's Finbar Sheehy for Doug. In your press release, you talked about higher sustainment activities in the quarter for the F-35. Can you talk to us about how big those are now, relative to total F-35 revenues and how you expect that's going to evolve over the next few years? Maybe how big a percentage of F-35 revenues will sustainment be, say, by the end of the decade? And how do margins on sustainment compare to the incremental margins you are getting now on new aircraft?
Bruce Tanner: I’ll trying that, Finbar. So sustainment is growing fairly rapidly. I mean I want to say it's not quite growing this year at the same pace as is production, but it's growing dramatically over last year's numbers. I mean you should think of this as in the sort of high teens sorts of numbers. So it's growing incrementally and it'll continue to do that for a number of years as we set up more and more bases, both around the United States, but as well internationally as international customer start letting down the aircraft in their home location. So that growth is going to continue. I don't have the exact split, but I want to say if you look at sustainment out of the total F-35 production, I want to say it's probably 20%, 25% as large as the production volume on an annual basis, something like that. And it stays at those sorts of levels for the next few years. So as production grows over the next couple of years to its peak when we hit full rate production, I would expect that the sustainment will sort of follow suit there.  And then your last question, Finbar, was relative to the margins and how we do on sustainment contracts. And I’ll tell you, we do about the same on the F-35 sustainment as we do on production. That might change somewhat in the future going forward, but at least historically and where we sit today, they're pretty comfortable without a whole lot of difference between them. 
Operator: Next we go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask about the SAR that came out last week and the change in peak quantity of the Air Force buy in the out years. It came down from 80 to 60, but we're talking about numbers that are pretty far out there in 2022, 2023 time frame. So I'm wondering how you are looking at that, what implications you think it might have, whether it's a change that you expect to stick around. 
Marillyn Hewson: I’ll take that, Seth. Thanks for the question. I would just say first off, we haven't really seen the SAR. I mean we know that it's been submitted to Congress. We know there's been top level readout from the JPO, but the fact sheet that came out on it. And I think in that, the Joint Program Office highlighted the fact that the reason that the numbers were changing were predominantly due to a change in the procurement profile of the Air Force jets, which is the largest volume buyer for the Air Force. And - but frankly, we just - I know that in my discussions with the Air Force, there's a desire to buy as many as they can, as quickly as they can. So I haven't got an official position from them that they’ve reduce their procurement profile. That just happens to be what's in that select acquisition report that came out going. I mean certainly lots of opportunity to change the quantities as you can see just with what's in the budget deliberations right now, the adds that are coming forward on the F-35 for the various services. We think it's still in - we’ll still see potentially some upside on it. So that would be my take. Bruce, anything you want to add?
Bruce Tanner: Another thing I might offer just for a little perspective. I think you had it right, Seth in that the planned peak volumes for the USAF are sort of far out there right now. Just to give you some perspective on that, we're still in discussions with the Joint Program Office relative to a potential block buy. And the numbers that have been thrown out for that block buy, and this is just again to put some perspective over three LRIPs, is about 400 and - between 440 and think of it as five - 450 or so aircraft over that three year LRIP period. So nearly 150 aircraft per year and that's what we're talking about for LRIPs 12, 13 and 14. So these are literally right around the corner. That’s 150 aircraft, with the USAF buying 48 aircraft in each of those three fiscal years. So the cut to 80, to 60, we're not even approaching the 60 yet, and we're building aircraft of quantities of 150 per fiscal year.  So as Marillyn said, a lot of opportunities to change quantities between now and then. And it will be interesting, once we do see the full SAR report, how much of that was sort of budgetarily really driven, with the potential to change that budget that much that further - that far out, excuse me, versus I’ll say a quantity difference. And if I read the fact sheet right actually from the JPO, I think the actual total quantity of US government buys for F-35s went up coincidentally enough by about 13 aircraft for additional Marine Corps buys. So pushing up to the right, but again as Marillyn said, lots of opportunity to change those values between now and then. 
Operator: Our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. 
George Shapiro: Good morning. Can you hear me?
Marillyn Hewson: Barely, George. Try again.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research: On the F-35, the incremental margin was 17%. So did you increase the margin on the LRIP 9 or 10, or both? And then also the deliveries were flat with last year, and down from Q1. So I would think that we'd be starting to see increases here, given the deliveries are going to be higher. So what's happening there? Thanks. 
Bruce Tanner: Yes. George, I’ll try those. So incremental margins, I didn't do the calculation that you just cited, but you're probably right. Your math is always good, George. And we did have a couple of pick-ups. I think we actually - you asked which specific LRIP we had some risk retirements or step ups, and we actually had, I want to say three separate LRIPs. And you should think of these as somewhat older LRIP contracts or LRIP numbers. I believe two of the three were five - LRIPs five and seven. So this is sort of reflecting the fact that we're closing out or getting ready to sort of close out some of those lots. The ones you talked about, the more current ones, Lot 9 and so forth and Lot 10, we're getting good performance on those, but that's probably step ups that we look forward to in the coming years as - coming quarters, as opposed to this quarter here.  And then as far as deliveries, George, now the way I look at that, I think there's - I think we're planning 66 aircraft to be delivered for the year. And what may not be clear in that number is there’s only - the biggest lion's share of that, 61 of those are being delivered out of Fort Worth. The other five are going to be delivered out of the international locations that Marillyn talked, the FACO in Nagoya, Japan and the other FACO in Italy. So none of those five aircraft have yet to deliver, although they’ve rolled out as Marillyn said. So all those are out in front of us. And as you look at where we ended the first half of the year, we'd actually delivered 29 aircraft. That number is a little deceptive because we closed the quarter actually on June 25 as opposed to the end of the month and we actually had some deliveries between then and the end of the month. As we sit here today, George, I want to say we’ve delivered 34 aircraft so far and I think we're on track to deliver 36 by the end of this month. So we're actually progressing essentially right on track on the domestic deliveries. And we do expect those five international deliveries to all take place in the second half. So short set, I think we're tracking to our expectations relative to 66 aircraft for the year. 
Operator: Our next questions from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. 
Pete Skibitski: Good morning guys. I had a further F-35 and Aeronautics margin question. Just because, Bruce, it seems like the F-35 has been kind of less of a headwind maybe than you expected going into this year. And I know some of it's on better performance at the international facilities and whatnot. But as you look out into 2018, it will be a bigger part of the mix, F-35 and Aeronautics. Do you have any confidence probably yet to say that this year is kind of the trough for Aeronautics margin, and we'll start to expand as we go out on higher F-35? Or is there still some uncertainty in some of the latest LRIP lots?
Bruce Tanner: Just to be clear, Pete, you’re talking about a trough for Aeronautics or a trough for F-35? You were talking about Aeronautics I presume, right?
Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton: Correct. Correct.
Bruce Tanner: You know what, I'm not sure I want to call that in this quarter, Pete. I’ll feel a whole lot better. We do our planning between now and the third quarter. And when we give you the trend information in 2018, I will surely address that then. But I don't think your question is that far off the mark. If the answer is not yes, that's probably where we'd expect the trough, the answer is it’s probably pretty close to that, maybe ’18 but we'll take a look at that when we give you the trend information in October. 
Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Bruce Tanner: Yes, and I should say, in any event we would still expect there - even if it was a trough, I don't see it dropping below 10%. The only question is we've had some, to your point, some pick-ups earlier this year is, can we match that next year going forward? But again I’ll give you a lot more insight in the October call. Thanks.
Operator: Next we go to David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead. 
David Strauss: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bruce, I guess first a clarification. The 3% to 5% revenue growth, and talking about maybe being at the lower end of that in 2018, does that include the change in revenue recognition? That's the clarification. And then thinking about cash conversion, free cash flow conversion over the next couple of years, you've obviously got pension cash moving down. But then as we look out towards the end of the decade, you have - your FAS expense is going to come down. Could you just talk about the progression of how you're seeing free cash flow conversion over the next maybe - towards the end of the decade? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: David, I'm actually glad you asked that clarification on the 3% to 5% were sort of based on current rev-rec methodology. Although we've give more information on this when we have the results, when we give the trend information in October. But at the least preliminarily (indiscernible) pulling together in anticipation of that rev-rec changing, we're kind of I’ll say running rev-rec in addition to the normal methodology for the first quarter and second quarter. I haven't seen the second quarter results yet. But so far everything is indicating that you would think we should see a whole lot of difference. And part of the reason for that is a lot of the units of delivery are what we call POT, Passage on Title transfer where we essentially record sales upon delivery. As long as you're sort of delivering at a constant rate and the program is not at the end of its life if you will, then you wouldn’t expect to see a large swing, even when you’ve converted over to a percentage of cost or cost to cost methodology, and that's sort of our expectation. We don't see a large drop off or a large increase or decrease in our POT deliveries there. So most importantly on our rev-rec, F-35 is not - does not change one bit and that's obviously the biggest driver of Aeronautics and for that matter, sales for the corporation. So I'm hopeful having said that, Dave, that the 3% to 5% sort of works under either methodology, the current methodology or the new rev-rec methodology is what I'm trying to say and we’ll see what that looks like when we provide the trend information in ’18 as I keep saying.  Relative to the free cash flow conversion, we teed this up. In the past, David, you and I have had a couple of conversations on this. We - I think the - we talked about FAS income. You sort of brought that up. In 2020 - the 2020 timeframe is the end of the accruals relative to our pension trust going forward. So essentially the trust becomes completely frozen at that point in time. And because you lose the service cost, we actually end up getting FAS income in that point in time. As far as cash is concerned, we will expect to see cash contribution, the ERISA contributions continue to increase through that period of time. But we would also expect to see CAS recoveries in our price that are government contracts increase by about a similar amount. So we still expect to have a tailwind associated with pension cash and free cash flow literally going out. I think it’s still consistent what we showed maybe as much as a year ago that all the way out through 2025, at least as we sit here today, we expect to have some tailwind from pension dynamics relative to our cash flow going forward, and that's still what we see today. 
Operator: Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai Von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. So since your first quarter, it looks like your foreign sales prospects have improved. Can you update us in terms of what you're looking for, for book to bill this year and any color on next year? And secondly, you mentioned a lot of the foreign potentials. You didn't mention some of the NATO missile defense potentials such as Romania, Sweden, for the Patriot system and MEADS. Thank you very much.
Bruce Tanner: Cai, I’ll take a stab at that and Marillyn can add some color to it if she wants to. So relative to the first question and how we're doing, we're actually tracking hopefully better or better than planned relative to international orders today. I don't have necessarily the book to bill for the year, but I mean trying to do this math in my head, I think we're slightly ahead of book to bill as we sit here today, meaning international order are higher than international sales to date. I would expect that to be the case at the end of the year. A lot of that obviously is predicated on whether or not we get sort of the first tranche of the KSA, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia orders that Marillyn talked about, those $28 billion worth of orders. There's the potential that some of those can come in between now and the end of the year. It's not obviously clear that they will. There’s obviously some congressional notifications and the like that has to take place and getting the funding employees to do that. But there is that possibility.  Now, even without that, I still think we'll probably be, probably in a positive situation book to bill because we won't have the sales for that either for international business there. So having said that, as we look out in the future, and you didn’t ask this question, Cai, but we still think we've got a chance to end the year potentially at around $100 billion of backlog if some of these, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia orders come in this year, as opposed to next year. But even without that, 95 to 100 is probably what we're expecting, and again more on the international side than the sales for the year. So a positive book to bill.  You asked about the air missile defense. We're still in conversations with Germany right now, the MEADS opportunity there. There's a stated objective to get that negotiation complete by the end of this year. We'll see if that actually closes then, but if not then, I would hope that that closes at least in the early part of 2018. And obviously there's Poland with the Patriot sale and we'll do a lot of the PAC-3 - all the PAC-3 missile associated with that sale. You mentioned some other NATO countries. I’ll let Marillyn maybe jump in and give you a little more insight than I can provide to you.
Marillyn Hewson: Sure. You mentioned Poland, Rumania and others. I mean of course we have Aegis Ashore, which is US system that’s been placed in Europe, but that's an opportunity. Missile defenses, there's a strong demand in Europe, as well as in other parts of the world, Asia Pacific and the Middle East where we continue to see opportunities. JASSM was an opportunity from the standpoint of Poland. And so there - you're exactly right. There continues to be in the NATO environment missile defense opportunities for us to continue to meet, as well as for other parts of the world. And I think as we have recently done the THAAD test out of Alaska, that was a very successful test. In fact, 14 out of 14 on THAAD, one that I'm sure that many countries will take a look at, at the successful capability of that to take out a ballistic missile. And so that being an opportunity that we've talked about that currently in South Korea, protecting that area in Guam. But certainly Japan and other countries will continue to look at THAAD as a capability in the European market as well. 
Operator: Our next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. On space, you raised the sales guidance there. And just curious on your outlook for space in general, going here in 2017, where the uptick was coming from. And then if ’18, this gives you any indication that it's actually got some growth in it. And then conversely, the incremental margins looked a little light, 5% incremental margins. Is that just to absorb the commercial satellite charges, or something else? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: I’ll try those, Myles. So we’re pleased with where space is heading this year in terms of sales. It’s - as I said in the prepared remarks, it's a little higher than our expectations. And obviously we increased the guidance for the year. It’s a little higher than what we expected when we started the year. I do think that portends well for 2018 growth. And there's some of that coming from our special programs business and there are some opportunities there that we have to see how they play out that will drive that either higher or not as high, depending on the outcome of those opportunities.  And then relative to the incremental margin, you have that right, Myles and that is reflective of the fact that some of that volume was offset by the commercial satellite charge that we did take in the quarter. And that's probably worth talking maybe a little bit about, only because it - that sounds like a bad item to have a charge on the commercial satellite. But this is really taking our old legacy A2100 satellite bus, which we've had for a number of decades and really providing a technology refresh of that legacy satellite. So it's sort of updating it to the current state of the art. We’re putting a whole lot of new technologies and capabilities into it, everything from power capabilities and increases to the propulsion on the satellite, the electronics. We've got a new solar array, new power regulator. So a lot of different items all being sort of put together. And unfortunately the satellite where this happened to be the first article for production, was the largest commercial satellite we ever built, or will have ever built.  And so - well, that's the bad news. The good news is, is this new configuration satellite has already resulted in new orders from the US government. And I look at it as this is something that we had to do. We had to refresh that product line and while I'd prefer it not to be on a fixed price commercial international contract I have to sort of cut your teeth on, we're glad that we're doing this now because this will position us to have a foundation for new satellite offerings hopefully for years to come. 
Operator: Next we go to with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joe DeNardi: Thanks very much. Bruce, wondering if you could just talk about capital deployment. From a leverage standpoint, are you comfortable with where you are now, and we should just assume that all of the free cash flow gets split up between the buyback and dividend? Or do you see some deleveraging over the next year or two?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So good question, Joe. That’s something we’re - we obviously talk every September with our board relative to future deployment actions relative to dividends, but before that session, before we have those discussions and we discuss that sort of strategic view with our board of directors, I’ll say the expectation is it's sort of more the same in terms of our deployment actions. We do have some near term debt retirements coming up starting in 2018. We’ll come - that's something that we’ll guide you towards relative to the trend information ’18 as far as our thinking relative. To refinancing that or paying that off. But our expectation is we probably do some deleveraging as I sit here today going forward in the near term. Those aren't huge chunks of debt, but some of these frankly are the very short term financing that we did actually to finance the Sikorsky transaction
Operator: Next we’ll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment: Good morning Marillyn and Bruce. Bruce, just sticking on Sikorsky, which you just mentioned - total military helicopter deliveries were down about 18% year to date. How are you thinking about that for the balance of the year? And then in the context of obviously the new multiyear with the US Army and Saudi, how should we think about the government deliveries going forward?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So this question, Peter, that's actually something I looked at as I was prepping for the call also. The first half deliveries of Black Hawks are down. And at least as I post that with our team at RMS, that really is just because of the timing of the contract deliveries in the current multi-year eight Black Hawk order profile. Even though we're down as you pointed out relative to last year, the expectation is that we still expect to actually deliver more Black Hawks this year than we did last year, just not a huge number, just a handful there. But we would expect to catch up and actually have sort of sequential growth in Black Hawk deliveries, with fourth quarter obviously being the highest by quite a bit relative to the first quarter. A little bit of a different pattern than what we saw in 2016, but that is the contractual pattern. And I didn't look close enough to see if that's because of the types of aircraft we have. We have some MEDEVAC helos versus utility helicopters and that might be part of it as well. But all sort of expected and that is the plan going forward again to sort of finish the year higher than we did this year.  You also asked about - there was another part of your question, Peter. I think you asked about 2018 relative to the multiyear nine. the multiyear nine, I think in - and I haven't got my head exactly around the deliveries next year, but I think they're fairly complement - maybe a little less than this year, but not hugely less. Alternatively as we look forward, the biggest - bigger drop off frankly is in the Romeo helicopters. These are the Naval Hawk helicopters if you will. That's sort of coming to a much lower number of production aircraft delivery like maybe by a third or so or more reduction next year. So one thing that we're watching to see if we can get some rebound on that is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. One of the items that was in that, actually two of the items that was in that $28 billion that Marillyn referenced before was for additional Black Hawks on top of what's in the multi-year nine Black Hawk deal today. And an additional - or additional Romeos are the Naval Hawk helicopters as well. So those have got to sort out and again the timing event, Peter is what we're watching very, very closely to see whether or not those orders come in this year, the early part of next year. But we're hopeful they can sort of butt up against the multi-year nine deliveries we're talking about.
Greg Gardner: John, this is Greg. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And that will be from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead. 
Jason Gursky: Good morning. I wanted to - Marillyn, I want to ask you about the Company's supply chain, your strategy there. You've spoken in the past about the need for Lockheed and its suppliers to focus on two things, affordability and cybersecurity, essentially to ensure continuity. Can you provide us a bit of an update on the Company's effort to drive affordability out of the supply chain and is your strategy continuing to evolve there? Are you looking to maybe vertically integrate a little bit more than where you've been in the past and as you look out at things, how far along do you think you are in accomplishing your near to medium term goals on affordability? And then on the cybersecurity front, how do you view the health of the industry overall at this point? And what's Lockheed and the rest of the industry currently doing to improve the cybersecurity health of the supply chain? Thanks.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Jason. Those are great questions. If you look at our supply chain, it represents 60, sometimes 70% of the revenue on many of our programs. It’s a very important element of our business in terms of our execution on programs, performance on programs as well as what we're able to financially accomplish with those programs. So that's great question. On the affordability front, I would just start with our largest program, which is the F-35 and representing last year about 23% of our sales. We put a lot of effort into that piece of it. And collectively with our team mates, major team mates, with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems, we worked together on something we call - that the government calls a blueprint for affordability, where we actually put funding upfront working, not just with the three team mates, Lockheed Martin, BAE and Northrop Grumman, but all the way through our supply chain and identifying areas where we can invest, continue to drive cost down on the F-35 beyond what you would normally get through a ramp up of production and the volume. And we'll continue to do that. We’re also doing that on the sustainment side. So look at where are there cost reduction initiatives that we can put in place there that would continue to drive the cost down. But we are - we work with supply chain affordability every day on all of our programs. I feel really good about our affordability initiatives in that regard. Our teams that work directly with our sub-contractors, with our suppliers, that is one of their primary efforts and ones that working alongside them, they’re constantly focused on. The other thing I would say is where we have a big opportunity on F-35 is through the block buy because that's where we can get the volume reduction. That’s where we can get suppliers, if they know they're going to get three lots worth of work, 450 airplanes and plus, then they can invest in driving the cost down. They can commit to a lower price to us on their element of the system. But bottom line is, we work all the way across our supply chain on ongoing basis and are constantly driving. In terms of vertical integration, I think it really just is driven on a case by case basis where it makes sense. I mean if we're assuming that we think we have the capability inside Lockheed Martin, that we could do at less cost and more - and better technology, then we might look at some vertical integration there or through an acquisition that gives us the opportunity to do that. But generally speaking, we're mainly focused on the affordability and the performance of our supply chain on an ongoing basis. You asked a question about cybersecurity and sort of the health of the industry and what are we doing on that front. I will just speak from a Lockheed Martin standpoint. We recognize that the supply chain is - it's critically important that they have in place appropriate cyber defenses in their business. And so we have worked with the Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards to help put in place voluntary initiatives that - and frameworks that work with supply chain on how they can get employees the appropriate defenses. We then audit and monitor what our supply chain, our suppliers have in the way of cybersecurity defenses on an ongoing basis. And we actually work with our customer. Our customer often looks to us for the depth and capability we have in cybersecurity. It is a line of business for us. We do it for many customers and supporting them, and we likewise take that same capability and try to work it back through the supply chain as well. In terms of health of the industry, I think it's an ongoing effort that we've got to constantly stay focused on as a nation. The threats are constantly changing or there's always an unpredictability in that sense. But we've been a thought leader and an industry leader in cybersecurity for many years. In fact we have the national cyber range where we develop that and where our government customers and others can bring their solutions and test them on those national cyber range and determine whether it brings the kind of defenses that we're looking for, that they expect. And so I would say across the board, cyber has been an area for us that, as in everything that we do across the system, it runs through all of our programs. It is - we have a robust capability that we provide to customers and we work hard with our supply chain to make sure that they get the right defenses in their own networks on ongoing basis. Thank you.  So I think that that was the last question. Greg, let me just wrap back and conclude the call today. I want to conclude by restating that our second quarter results and our increased 2017 outlook reflect that we have an ongoing commitment to our strategy for growth, strong cash generation and we continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers and long term value creation for our stockholders. We’re very pleased with the solid results that we had for the quarter. I want to thank you all for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you on the next earnings call in October. So John, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg M. Gardner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thank you, Karen, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to have you with us to review our first quarter results. As today's release detailed, we had a solid quarter operationally and financially with strong top-line growth and outstanding cash generation. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our team for their continuing efforts, as we focus the corporation on growth, successfully delivering solutions to customers and value to stockholders. While Bruce will cover the financial results in detail a little later, I wanted to touch on several highlights for this quarter. First, our operating profit and earnings per share were negatively impacted by two earnings adjustments that I will comment on in a minute. Our EPS of $2.61 equaled that of last year; however, our EPS would have been $3 per share without these adjustments. Second, our cash from operations was strong in the quarter and we increased our outlook for the year. And lastly, we returned over $1 billion to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. I'd like to take a moment to comment on the two earnings adjustments that occurred this quarter, which caused an unanticipated negative impact to operating profit and EPS. The first was a charge associated with an international C4I contract to produce the world's first end-to-end integrated air and missile defense system. Our solution to date has proven to be less mature than needed for this highly complex effort and we are working with the customer to fulfill their requirements. We do believe, however, that once completed, this system has the potential to bring these uniquely integrated capabilities to other customers around the world. The second item is a non-cash impairment charge related to an international joint venture in which we participate. During the first quarter, the venture in which we own a minority interest, determined that reduced business prospects required it to impair certain assets. As a consequence, we recorded our proportionate share and this resulted in the other charge you saw in our earnings release today. Finally, I am pleased to report that during the first quarter, we were able to arrive at an overall economic agreement for F-35 LRIPs 9 through 11, that allowed us to accept the unilateral pricing for LRIP 9, complete negotiations for LRIP 10 and establish cash payment terms for all three lots that were improvements over previous positions. It was the overall bundling of economic considerations and resulting improved cash terms that enabled us to increase our cash outlook for the year that you saw in our earnings release. We will continue our strong emphasis on growth, cash generation and shareholder-friendly actions as our business areas continue to provide products and services that are in great demand by our customers. Before discussing operational highlights from our business areas this quarter, I'd like to outline the status of DOD budgets. At this time, government spending remains limited by the continuing resolution that is set to expire on April 28. As you know, the continuing resolution, or CR, limits funding to prior year's levels and prohibits new programs from starting. Discussions are underway to extend the CR as Congress continues to debate the regular appropriations bills. We are hopeful that these discussions result in an approved FY 2017 Defense Appropriations Act as we feel a further lack of budget clarity could have longer-term consequences for our armed forces and our industry. And we continue to urge our country's leadership to reach an agreement. There are however, several encouraging indications that our nation's leaders are aligned with the need for a focus on defense spending. First, the House recently passed the FY 2017 appropriations bill, and it is currently residing with the Senate. This bill, which is in compliance with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, also supports vital equipment procurement, with increased spending called out for BLACK HAWK helicopters, as well as additional F-35s. Similarly, we are pleased to see President Trump's 2017 supplemental defense appropriations submission and the administration's initial FY 2018 budget outline, or skinny budget; both request funds in excess of the Budget Control Act caps. Last month, I attended the Munich Security Conference, where well-respected leaders from the U.S. and participating countries echoed the theme that the international security environment has become increasingly more volatile. Recent events around the world have only served to confirm this sentiment. We, as a nation, need to recognize these threats and provide our military leaders relief from current budgetary constraints and allow them to address the challenges they face in defense of our country and our citizens. We remain hopeful that progress will continue to be made in this area, and upcoming legislation will include the increases necessary to continue to equip and maintain our fighting forces. Moving to operations, the quarter contained multiple mission success events, and I'd like to feature one each from our Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, and Rotary and Mission Systems business areas. As some of you may know, this past February, the U.S. Air Force held their premier air combat exercise, Red Flag, at Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas, Nevada. This year's training event featured, for the first time, the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing, or CTOL, variant, which was placed into service following its successful initial operating capability declaration in August of 2016. After flying over 207 sorties, the fleet of 13 F-35A jets posted an impressive success rate of 20 to 1 against the highest level threats known in the simulated contested environment. Just as importantly, the aircraft's stealth capability and electronic warfare suite allowed it to eliminate ground-based surface-to-air missile installations, effectively securing the battle space and providing unparalleled situational awareness. In addition, the F-35 flew alongside the F-22 Raptor and joint and coalition forces, including participants from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United Kingdom's RAF, demonstrating the important interoperability this generation platform provides. Lastly, and just as significantly, the CTOL jet excelled in the maintenance aspect of the exercise. The F-35 and its Autonomic Logistics Information System, or ALIS, proved to be a highly reliable weapon system, achieving a mission capable rate well above 90%, and far surpassing legacy aircraft averages of 70% to 85% availability during the high ops tempo environment of Red Flag, a design quality that has been recognized by users as a true differentiator of this product. We believe the success of this event continues to highlight the unprecedented abilities of the F-35, and we are proud to produce the most capable and reliable aircraft in the world. Turning to our Missiles and Fire Control business area, I'd like to highlight a noteworthy milestone that occurred this quarter. Last month, we were honored to have our long range anti-ship missile, or LRASM, selected as the Aviation Week Laureate Award winner in the Defense category for its technical achievements in meeting an urgent operational need of our warfighters. LRASM is a precision-guided, anti-ship standoff missile based on the Extended Range version of our Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, or JASSM-ER variant. LRASM is currently being developed and integrated for operational capability on Navy and Air Force platforms. Also, in collaboration with our Rotary and Mission Systems business area and their vertical launch system technology, our Missiles and Fire Control team initiated development with our own investment funding of an innovative surface launch solution that can be deployed from ships at sea, providing the U.S. Navy with new anti-surface warfare capability as part of their distributed lethality concept. We were pleased with this award recognition and with our ability to continue to bring our company's capabilities and collaboration to bear for our customers and warfighters. Finally, just a few weeks ago, in our Rotary and Mission Systems business area, our Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter, received an affirmative Milestone C decision from the Defense Acquisition Board and will now enter the low rate initial production phase of the program. This Milestone C decision comes less than 18 months after the CH-53K made its first flight, a remarkable accomplishment for this aircraft, with its unmatched payload capability and modern avionics. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our first quarter financial performance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We had mixed results as we begin 2017. As expected, we had strong sales growth across the portfolio, along with outstanding cash generation in the quarter, and we continue to implement the cash deployment actions that our stockholders are used to seeing. On the other hand, our operating profit in the quarter was impacted by two negative events that detracted from what otherwise would have been a strong earnings quarter. Based on these results, we've updated our outlook for the year to reflect higher sales and cash from operations, and slightly lower segment operating profit and earnings per share. We'll elaborate on all of these items as we progress through the next few charts. On chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about 7% higher this quarter, compared with last year, with each of the four business areas showing growth over last year's results. Aeronautics and Space Systems led the growth, with Aeronautics driven by F-35 production and sustainment, which more than offset one fewer aircraft delivery in the quarter for the both C-130 and C-5 programs. Space Systems growth was driven by the inclusion of AWE sales this quarter, compared with none in the first quarter of last year. Both Rotary and Mission Systems and Missiles and Fire Control grew at low single-digit rates in the quarter. Earnings per share of $2.61 was consistent with our results from a year ago, but this quarter's results included $0.39 of charges associated with our revised estimate to complete the C4I contract and the joint venture impairment. These two items offset strong performance by Space Systems in the quarter, along with higher earnings in Aeronautics due to the continued increase in F-35 activity. Turning to chart 5, we'll discuss the cash return to our shareholders in the quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditure level from the $1.7 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, our free cash flow was $1.5 billion. We've returned just over $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter or 70% of our free cash flow. And this was fairly evenly split between share repurchases and dividends. So we're right on track for the full year cash deployment goals we discussed last quarter. On chart 6, we'll provide our updated outlook for 2017. We're increasing our sales outlook by $100 million based on higher expectations for Space Systems for the rest of this year. Our segment operating profit outlook has several moving pieces that net to a $30 million reduction from our previous guidance. We are lowering our RMS's outlook by $90 million, with a $120 million C4I charge, partially offset by $30 million of improved performance in other parts of the portfolio. We're increasing our outlook for Aeronautics by $35 million and Space Systems by $25 million for the year with the Aeronautics increase driven by performance improvements in a number of programs and the Space Systems increase driven mostly by higher expected equity earnings from ULA. Our other unallocated expense increased by $50 million, mostly driven by the joint venture impairment we discussed. We'll show how all these changes impacted our earnings per share outlook on the next chart and finally, we are increasing our cash from operations by $300 million to now be greater than or equal to $6 billion. Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook. As we've already discussed, the C4I charge and the JV impairment are $0.25 and $0.14 negative impacts to our January EPS outlook range of $12.25 to $12.55. Combined, the increased outlooks from Aeronautics and Space Systems, along with the partial offset within RMS add $90 million to our segment operating profit outlook or about $0.20 to our previous EPS guidance. And a lower tax expense forecast, along with several other minor improvements in our expense outlook, adds another $0.09 to our prior outlook. Netting all of these items results in a reduction of $0.10 in our EPS outlook or a new guidance range of $12.15 to $12.45. On chart 8, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. The $100 million increase in sales is due to the improved outlook we have for Space Systems for the rest of the year. We're maintaining the sales ranges for the other three business areas at this time. Chart 9 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We decreased our operating profit outlook in total by $30 million. RMS is down $90 million for the C4I contract charge, net of other improvements. Aeronautics is $35 million higher and Space Systems is higher by $25 million. And finally, on chart 10, we have our summary. Our first quarter performance was mixed with a couple of earnings charges detracting from strong performance elsewhere in the business. Our cash performance was strong in the quarter and we expect that performance to carry over to a higher full year outlook than we provided last quarter. We continue to provide significant cash returns to our stockholders and we're not giving up on trying to overcome our early setbacks and making 2017 a year we can be proud of. With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?
Operator: Thank you. In the interest of time, we are limiting you to one question. Please return to the queue for any follow-up questions. And our first question for today comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein Research.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hey, Doug.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: On F-35, two things. If you look at the situation, if we should end up in a continuing resolution, could you talk a little bit about what that might mean for F-35? And then, also you've talked about getting the CTOL version, the price down to about, maybe, under $80 million by 2021. Can you talk about what that means for the margin trajectory for the program?
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: So, Doug, just on a continuing resolution, we wouldn't expect any impact on F-35. That, as you know, is a long-cycled business. The contracts that we're performing on were some time ago. So with – the CR effects are not being able to add new contracts at this point. So the program that we're producing on today is not impacted by the CR. I'll let Bruce pick up the question on margins.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yeah. I don't think I've got a whole lot off from the CR issue, Doug, other than – as you well know the F-35, I mean the work that we're performing today was from several fiscal years ago. It takes about three years or so to go through the F-35 lifecycle from sort of the initial dollar award to the first aircraft delivery. So, as Marillyn said, I wouldn't expect to see, especially in 2017, much of an impact, if anything, even should CR be extended. On the CTOL question, getting price below $80 million and its impact on margin, the only way that would impact our margin negatively, Doug, is if we price those contracts assuming that we can get there and obviously don't achieve that but that's not our expectation. Our expectation is that we'll bring – be able to bring the cost down to support that price with both the U.S. government customer as well as our international customers and make the profit levels that we've talked about before that we should be making, when we get to kind of full rate production on this contract around this program. So, I would say, arguably no impact unless we have performance that we're not expecting to have in that timeframe.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yes, Bruce, just a follow-up on that F-35. The sales increase seeing a little low to me, given I thought we're going to get up about $2.5 billion for the year, if you just comment on that. And then in return for getting better cash terms on the program, did you give up anything in potential margin, or if not, what did you give up? And then, incremental margin in the quarter was about 17%, would imply that there were some pickups in margin rates, if you could talk about which blocks. Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, George. Good questions. So, yeah, sales in the first quarter probably were a little lighter than we'd expected. I think it's important that we did say we're going to hold the guidance for the other business areas besides Space Systems that includes Aeronautics. We still think that the F-35 program is going to have the kind of volume growth throughout the rest of the year that we saw – that we forecasted in the guidance that we provided to you last quarter. And just to put it in some perspective, I think I looked at the F-35 program. I think the first quarter is up like 15% over the first quarter of last year. So we're still seeing some pretty significant volume increases, even though we expect the full year to actually be higher than that. So I still think we're going to track to the outlook we provided in first quarter and I think we'll catch up between now and the end of the year to where we expected to be when we talked last quarter. The better cash terms that we got there, you should think of that impacting the LRIP 9 contract, LRIP 10 and LRIP 11. And I think your question specifically, George, was, did we give up margins associated with that. You should think of this as sort of bundling of a lot of things that got together the – I'll say the biggest thing that – and this was in Marillyn's comments. The biggest thing that we gave up during this bundling of activities or economic opportunities was we dropped the claim on the LRIP 9 unilateral and we feel good about that. Frankly, we're glad to have that behind us. And we think that the economic benefits of what we got collectively justified dropping that claim going forward. So we're good and we're glad to get that behind us. And then lastly, as you usually do, George, you did a good analysis on sort of the incremental margin in the quarter and it is higher. I think you said 17%, I think that's about right. Couple of things happened there and I think it's all good news as you might expect there. One of the bigger things that happened is we actually had some step ups associated with our international final assembly and checkout facilities. I think of this as both the Italian facility as well as the Japanese facility where we're doing the – as by definition, the final assembly and checkout of F-35s at those two locations. As you might expect, we started those efforts fairly low. It's not easy to sort of establish from essentially nowhere, a program of record and the ability to deliver aircraft at an international location. So we started looking those – both those locations and the work that we're doing to support those establishments pretty conservatively. It turns out, we're doing pretty good on those contracts and we're actually delivering aircraft out of the Italian FACO and expect to soon on the Japanese FACO as well. So, because of that, we were actually able to step up from our previous conservative numbers there and we feel good about where we are as we sit here today. So, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hey, Peter.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Bruce, maybe just it's kind of a quick one on first, just clarification. What should we expect for kind of overall helicopter deliveries , Bruce, (25:40) for the year? I understand, commercial, obviously, is way down, but just kind of expectations around kind of the government deliveries. And then just also just related to, I guess, LRIP 11 was kind of key for your overall bookings guidance for the year for 2017. Are you still kind of targeting a book-to-bill of near 1 for 2017? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Peter. So, helo deliveries for the year, in total, were down in the first quarter. As you saw from the earnings release we provided, I think we're down 14 in total between our commercial and military aircraft in the first quarter. We actually expect that to pick up in the next three quarters of the year, and actually finish the year just about at the exact same spot that we ended 2016 with in terms of deliveries; you should think of that as 180-plus helos in total. We did not deliver – I don't remember if you asked this question or not, Peter, but just to comment on it, we did not deliver any commercial helos in the first quarter. However, if you look at the outlook for the rest of the year, we do expect to deliver about the same number of commercial helos in 2017 as we did in 2016. Those helos are in the backlog as we sit here today, they're just phased differently in the year than they were last year. And then I think your – let's see, I think that just bakes into what's the – the military helicopters are the difference between the total in that 10 aircraft that I just talked about there. And I think your last question was on the LRIP 11 and booking guidelines and our booking guidance that we provided. We still expect to see – it's probably going to come in two tranches, Peter. Second quarter, we expect to get an undefinitized contractual action, very large one, associated with LRIP 11. So that will be a pretty significant order, pretty significant increase in book-to-bill in the quarter. And then we're hoping, and I think the government is hoping as well, to finalize and definitize the LRIP 11 contract by the third quarter of this year. We'll get another little bump associated with that definitization. And we do expect, as you said in the question, we do expect to finish the year at a greater than 1:1 – or 1.0, excuse me, book-to-bill ratio.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you very much.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hey, Joe.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Bruce, I'm wondering if you could just talk about, over the past five or six months, just at a very high level, on F-35, has anything changed on that program? Clearly, there's been a lot of discussion around pricing and contracting. Has anything changed on that program at all over the past few months that would kind of affect your view on margins on that program longer term?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: No, Joe, I'm trying to think. The only thing that's happened over the last six months sort of negatively on the program, we did have this tube issue, which we refer to as the PAO tube issue, that we had to essentially make some modifications into some delivered aircraft to remove that – remove and replace that tubing, as well as change the process going forward. That had a slight hit to the overall performance on the program, but other than that, there's not – I'm thinking and I'm looking at Marillyn when I'm saying this, Joe, there's nothing structural that I would point to that's different than what we've been saying for the last couple years about our ability to sort of structurally grow the program's margins as we head into full rate production. So, I think the short answer to your question is no.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: And the PAO tubes issue is behind us now. We have modified all the aircraft.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good point. PAO is – we're done. I think it was done actually at very beginning of the first quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Bruce and Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a clarification on the cash, and then I wondered if you could give us just a little bit more color on the booking rate adjustments. I think you called out there were several. Did the LRIP finalization 9 through 11 have any impact, upwardly, on the multi-year cash profile that you had talked about previously ,or did it impact the phasing? And then on the booking rates, I noticed that you were down, clearly, a C-5 delivery, and you called out the revenues, but no mention of the profits there. Was there a booking rate adjustment there? And you called out a couple of negative booking rate adjustments on various programs. I wondered if you could just give us some color on that.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Okay. Carter, I'll take a shot at those. So, I think just the overall booking rate adjustments, I think you're asking about the F-35 in particular, and we mentioned a couple. The biggest change in F-35 were for those two international...
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: FACOs, yeah.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: ...final assembly and checkout, yeah, final assembly and checkout facilities that I talked about before in Italy and Japan. And as I said, this is a good example where we perform – we had a couple of setbacks with some international programs. Here is some good news on the international side, where we actually did a very good job of establishing those facilities and are doing a good job at those facilities, and that resulted in the (31:28) that you saw in the first quarter. LRIP 9 through 11, I think your question relates to the three-year $15 billion or more objective that we established our goal that we established last, I guess, it was fourth quarter or first quarter of this year. I think it gives us an opportunity, Carter. It surely gives us greater clarity, because we've got better insight into established terms and conditions for the next three significant LRIP contracts in a row. So we won't have to, if you will, haggle over terms and conditions associated with cash collections. So, I'd like to think that gave us greater clarity, and I think it gives us some potential to have some better performance, F-35 related, relative to what we had expectation wise in that $15 billion as well. So, I think there is the possibility there that you were hinting at in your question. And then on the C-5, we did mention the profit being down, for the one aircraft being down. There was no really change in margins whatsoever, and there was – and I'll say an associated earnings reduction associated with the lower sales volume, but margin is exactly the same as it was a year ago, so no change there whatsoever.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much, and good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Sikorsky and whether you expect to get to a positive contribution on the EBIT line from Sikorsky this year. And then whether next year promises to see kind of more meaningful EBIT contribution and if you could size that at all?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Seth, can you go through that one more time, I'm not sure I followed that entirely.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sure. Yeah. On Sikorsky, I wonder if you could tell us, if you expect to get to a positive EBIT contribution from Sikorsky in 2017 and then if we should think about a much more meaningful contribution in 2018 on the EBIT line and maybe if you could size that.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yeah. Sorry. So, the Sikorsky, I think, we're really close, well let's back up. Sikorsky is always going to have, at least for a long period of time, the intangible amortization associated with the purchase accounting, if you will, for that acquisition. So you should think of Sikorsky getting $230 million or so a year, at least for the next few years and then I think it sort of gradually gets smaller than that. But we'll have that with us for – I think the period of amortization is something like 15 years. So, it's going to be with us a long time. That's going to be a drag there. As we look at kind of 2017, I think Sikorsky is actually going to be a positive for us in terms of absolute EBIT dollars, even with that drag. It's going to get a little, I'll say, messier going forward, because we've actually combined some things in with Sikorsky from the heritage Lockheed Martin performance. So, for instance, several of you have been to our facilities in Owego, New York, where we do or have done historically a lot of helicopter modification programs and helicopter enhancement programs, including the U.S. Navy's Romeo and Sierra, sort of submarine hunting helicopter and the mission packages that go with that. We've combined that together with what we are now referring to as Sikorsky, at least internally. And if you add that together with the piece that came from Owego, it's a strong positive to us in the year. But just focusing on Sikorsky going forward into 2018, we should see an uptick there, as we continue to sort of wean our way from the restructuring charges and some of the implementation cost that we have, in order to attain the savings that we expect to see. And we do expect to see those savings start to materialize in pretty good fashion starting in 2018. So that'll be our expectation. I think more importantly, as we've talked about in the past, 2018's cash flow is where we're expecting to see some pretty good sized increases and that's predominantly because of working off a lot of the development programs and especially things like the Canadian Maritime Helicopter program, where we're actually at a loss position when we acquire that business. And as we start to get out of the CMH – or not the CHMP, the CH-53K developments and the presidential helicopters and actually started converting these into production contracts. We should start seeing much stronger cash flows starting in 2018 to accompany the increase in earnings that I just talked about.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey, good morning guys. Not sure how to pronounce this, but EDGE-T may be. Can you give us a sense of how much risk remains on that program and maybe also that the timing of some of the key risk retirement milestones?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yeah. Pete, I'll take a shot at that. So it's EDGE-T, I know it well. Let me just give you a little bit of background, maybe just I think it'd be helpful in not just with where we got to go in the future, but maybe how we got here. I think as I look at this, what's sort of unusual about this is this is a firm fixed priced contract that includes a pretty substantial amount of developmental work. That's not something that we generally sign up for. I mean, typically in a perfect world, we'd like to deliver sort of products off our production lines internationally. On this one, we actually chose to do some development and almost by definition, when you do that at an international environment, you're going to do it on a fixed price basis. Frankly, that's one of the reasons why we like to do most of the development with U.S. government under a cost-reimbursable type contract as opposed to development contract – as opposed to fixed price, excuse me. We knew, going in, this would be a challenge to perform this work, but we had developed capabilities under our own IRAD dollars that we thought would make this essentially an off-the-shelf solution and we sort of priced it accordingly. And as it turns out, as we got into the implementation of this, the solution ended up being far less robust than what was needed. And I'll say the implementation environment was more complex than we expected. And there was also some evolving customer requirements and sort of some give and take that occurred, the longer the implementation took to deploy. So, all of those things led us to where we are today. Where we sit today, we think we have this sized appropriately. The milestones that you talked about going forward and probably what we won't talk about those milestones, because they're not necessarily large enough in the total scheme of things of Lockheed Martin to mention. But amongst them is finalizing this off-the-shelf system and putting it in place in country. We think we're about there. We're doing that and we think it's now has the capabilities that were promised in the contract. Now, it gets down to sort of the implementing and connecting a whole bunch of systems in country to this sort of command and control structure and making sure they all talk to each other and work each other. There's probably another two years, I'm going to guess, Pete, worth of the work to do. And we'll surely keep you apprised as we go through the next few quarters, if there's any issues there. But, we think we have this thing sized about right as we said – as I said earlier. I mean this is unfortunately not the first charge that we've taken on this contract. We took some charges throughout, I think, the last – the biggest one was in 2015. But, we sort of took some incremental changes in 2016, but we think we've sized this thing about right. The reason this was important to us, Pete, was – and the reason we took the chance to do an international program with fixed price development is, as Marillyn said in our opening remarks, no one's ever done this before. I mean, this – "some people, this is hard work." But the good news is if we do this hard work, there's a lot of international customers who would like to have this capability for their own integrated air missile defense systems. And we think there's even potentially a play to come back within the U.S. government for this capability as well. So it's pretty unique in its capabilities, but it was pretty difficult to do and we're hoping there's a tail of business that comes along with our successful completion of this contract.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hey, David.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Bruce, Missiles and Fire Control, can you touch on the program mix and margin profile there? I think the margins have been coming down in that business for several years now, I think that you've primarily cited the mix of business within that. Can you talk about when you see that mix kind of bottoming out in the margin profile from here? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Sure, David. So, Missile and Fire Control (sic) [Missiles and Fire Control] (41:26), I probably have sounded like a broken record on this, but there is a lot of things going on, and we've talked about them in the past, but I'll probably repeat myself here a little bit. We had a number of some larger programs, especially, sort of the consumable OCO type contracts where we had HELLFIREs and guided multiple launch rocket systems, ATACMS missiles and the like, where we did – time after time would get continual orders on top of previous orders and we did well on those contracts. Sort of the volume aspects of that helped us a lot because there was quick need for those products and they did well for us. We also completed a couple of larger programs relative to PAC-3s, couple larger contracts that we also performed better than what we negotiated on. And all of this sort of culminated at the end of 2015, middle of 2016 where we had to start renegotiating those contracts over and basically, you snap a new line in the sand and you start off with your historical good performance and you've got to sort of achieve that again to make those sorts of margins. So, we had a bit of a reset, if you will, on the new business where we've done previously better than negotiated; and on the new business, we started off booking essentially at the negotiated amount, so that's part of it. The other part is, we have made some strategic bids in Missiles and Fire Control, and fortunately, we have been successful on a couple of those bids. Primary amongst that was the JAGM missile, the Joint Air-to-Ground missile, which is essentially the replacement long-term for the HELLFIRE missile. We did go into that, as you might expect, pricing it as this – if it was a strategic opportunity. We won that but what that says is during the development, parts of that program, its margin is much, much lower than what we would historically see at Missiles and Fire Control. There is a couple of other opportunities and development programs, not all of which we can talk about, that we either are performing on or we expect to and hope to win on, that also sort of drags to our historical level of higher margins on Missiles and Fire Control. And frankly, if we win those and perform on them as we expect, I would not expect to see huge improvements in the Missiles and Fire Control margins over the next couple of years. And that would be a good thing because the volume that we would have on that new business will be the type of business that will support us for literally decades to come. So it's worth sort of the strategic investments and the strategic bids that we put forward. But it does come at the expense of historically high margins. Having said that, I'm very pleased with Missile and Fire Control, it's not like they are our problem child whatsoever, we are still looking at just south of, what, 15% margins, so it's a highly, highly performing business, highest margin within the corporation still and we would expect that to be the case going forward.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hi, Jason.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Marillyn, I wonder if you would – hey, good morning. Wonder if you would spend a few minutes on talking about the opportunity set in front of you here over the next 12 to say 18 months, I know we've got things like T-X trainer and JSTARS and a little bit further out there is maybe Future Vertical Lift here on the domestic side, and then maybe some of the international opportunities, MEADS, THAAD, Aegis in the European, Middle East and Asian areas?
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Sure, Jason. Thanks for the question. Just starting off with F-35, if you just look at the ramp-up on that program, it's very significant over the next few years. And when we get to full rate production, we'll probably be delivering roughly 200 aircraft a year. So, that's a big opportunity. The next five years, we think about 50% of the orders will be in the international marketplace. We're continuing to see additional interest from a lot of countries around the F-35 that are currently not in the program of record, so we expect that over the next few to several years, that we'll continue to see additional countries that will become buyers of the F-35. In the area of missile defense, that continues to be a great demand for us internationally. You mentioned Aegis and PAC-3, also THAAD is another one that we expect. Areas like in the Middle East, we expect that there we will continue to see opportunities. You've probably seen that there was a notification on Qatar and we think some other countries in that region will also be considering THAAD as we go forward. And then beyond that, Aegis, as we've sold some systems on Aegis, we'll continue to see opportunities for, potentially, for Aegis Ashore, which is the land-based Aegis and we continue to sell PAC-3s. So, in the missile defense arena, PAC-3 MSE, the extended range, we expect we'll continue to see strong demand. And then there is MEADS. Germany has already selected MEADS, the Medium Extended Air Defense System, and we're moving forward on that. We expect to get underway this year with a contract with them – or late this year, and we'll see other countries; watch that space. We've had interest from Poland and others. And then, continuing on the international front, F-16, as you've probably seen, there has been an informal Congressional notification for selling F-16s to Bahrain, up to 19 or 20 aircraft. And we continue to be looking at the opportunity for selling F-16s to India, which could be a much bigger buy by India over time, as they move through their process. So, and then F-16 upgrades, we were doing from South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and others that have made a selection on that. We think, with that large fleet that's out there, that we'll continue to see other countries that will look at F-16 upgrades. So on the aircraft front and the missile defense front, continuing opportunities. And beyond that, I mentioned LRASM in my discussion on the front end with my opening remarks. We think there is a big opportunity for LRASM for the U.S. government as we move forward. We've sold JASSMs to other countries, so LRASM even could be a potential for international opportunities. T-X and JSTARS are two bids that, this year, that we are participating in. We think we have a very strong offering on T-X, the next trainer replacing the T-38, that capability we're offering is a T-50A, It's a very mature program that has low risk, and we can accelerate the schedule and meet the needs of the Air Force up to two years earlier than probably a clean sheet design could do, or maybe more. So, we're very much ready with our offering on that; we expect to be very competitive in that opportunity. JSTARS, we've got a great team pulled together on JSTARS as well, and we're bidding on that opportunity. Future Vertical Lift is a little further out, but of course, we're in the demonstration phase, in the technical demonstration on that, and are teaming on that capability. So, we expect to be in a good position for Future Vertical Lift as we go forward. And then the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, we will participate in that competition, and we think we have a strong offering and LRSO. So, we are engaged in, not only our current portfolio that we believe is very strong and there is a strong demand for, but we are pursuing some big opportunities in other areas. And I didn't mention our Space Systems area, but commercial satellites and the satellites for the military, as we continue to grow that portfolio as well. So, I think I've kind of walked around the system. I did mention C-130, I mean, there continues to be interest in the C-130 in countries like India and Saudi Arabia and France and Germany, and we hope to – we are currently on a multi-year with the U.S. government, we would expect them to continue to purchase C-130s going forward. And I think that – Bruce, any others, maybe, you can add to that? I've kind of tried to walk around the portfolio. We have a very broad portfolio, as you all know, and a very strong portfolio. So, we're really pleased with how well it's supported in the current budget, and what's in the budget deliberations going forward for the U.S. government. But around the world, we've got great opportunities internationally.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: No, I think you covered it.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, Marillyn, Bruce, Greg, good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Marillyn, maybe I'll follow up a little bit more on that F-16 comments you were just making here. Just a couple of items here, or a few items here on that. So, I saw you moving the line out of Forth Worth to Greenville. I thought that was interesting decision, considering you're only having a few remaining in backlog. So, what does it mean that you're moving the line? You mentioned Bahrain as a possible order here, is that something you could see happen this year, because I think you'll – you don't have enough in backlog, I think, to finish the year, if I'm correct about that? And then, also, it seems that the Air Force is interested in extending the life of the F-16, some kind of SLEP program, and maybe you could discuss the implications of that, and what you're expectations are there?
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Rich. Well, first off, yes, we are moving the line to Greenville, and let me just give a little background on that. I think we've let you all know that we will be delivering our last F-16s off the line in Fort Worth later this year, and then actually, the line will stop for a period of time. It was important for us to continue to look at restarting that line. We know how to do that, we have a robust supply chain that has been able to increase and decrease over the life of the F-16, and deal with changes in quantities, and we're ready to restart that line. The reason we're moving to Greenville is, we're ramping up production on the F-35 in Forth Worth, we need the facilities there for what we're doing. Greenville is a great operation that has a strong talent and good facilities there. So, it will be a final assembly and check-out facility for the F-16 there, it's just – we basically produce the aircraft through our supply chain elements of it, and we will assemble it there and deliver it from Greenville. And we're excited about that, it's a – we've also selected Greenville as our site for producing the final assembly of the T-X, of our trainer opportunity as well, the T-50A, so – and we have demonstrated the capability for doing fighters in that facility, so we're excited about it being the place for the future F-16s. In terms of it being this year, for Bahrain, getting an order this year, we feel good about it, but it's really government to government, so we'll have to go through the finishing up on the formal congressional notification and get an order underway. And we look forward to that opportunity. We're very encouraged by that, and we would produce those in Greenville for that reason. In terms of the F-16 SLEP, the Service Life Extension Program, we were pleased to see that the F-16 was designated to have an extended useful life. It has been a strong program for us, and so we continue, as I said, to do upgrades around the world, so that airframe and its capability, it has demonstrated it can fly many more hours and that will open the opportunity for putting new systems on it, new weapons systems, new mission systems and radars and things of that nature. So we see that as a very positive for that fleet, for it to continue to serve our customers, not only U.S. Air Force, but customers around the world for many, many years to come.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks so much. Maybe if you could give us a little more color on the JV adjustments you took. And then ULA, I guess was strong in the quarter; my understanding was, it was expected to be down about $150 million from the 3.25 (54:59) last year. What's changed there? And then maybe on the revenue recognition accounting changes expected to come next year, just a quick thought on what that should do. I assume that would be a big plus for the CH-53? Thanks.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: So, Cai, maybe I'll take the JV, and then let Bruce pickup on the AWE and Bruce you can fill anything more on that. The JV itself, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, this is a non-cash impairment charge. And we are actually a minority interest in this JV. Back in the mid to late 2000s, the UAE was looking for U.S. partners that would help them to develop their fixed wing and rotary wing sustainment capabilities so that they could support their aircraft in-country and look at broadly supporting beyond the UAE, other countries' aircraft. And we entered in this joint venture in 2010. At the time, we were a 20% owner in it from a Lockheed Martin standpoint, Sikorsky was a 20% owner, and the UAE entity had 60%. Of course, when we acquired Sikorsky in 2015, that increased our position. So, we are a 40% owner in the joint venture. The joint venture has been successful. It's been a good joint venture, it's got about 4,000 employees, sales of about $1.5 billion a year. It's been very profitable every year with equity earnings that come back to us through Sikorsky and now to us, both our share and Sikorsky's share. And it's generated to offset credits for us that have satisfied a lot of obligations for us for the programs that we have in country. So from that standpoint, it's successful. The ambition, though, for that entity is for it to grow regionally and become a sustainment center for the region. And so facilities were built and machinery and equipment procured in order to prepare for growing beyond just the UAE market. And unfortunately those projections haven't materialized. The fact that oil prices have been lower has not helped matters, but it's been a damper on what the outlook was for it. So, the charge basically recognizes the diminished value of those assets and the lower demand environment. We still have aspirations for that entity, and hopefully, we will see longer term that outlook. But as we looked at it today, the reduced business prospects, the entity determined that they needed to impair certain assets, and so that's what we dealt with.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: And Kyle, I'll take a shot at your other two questions. ULA, I think your analysis is right on. And you should think about it's really just the phasing in the year. We're still expecting that ULA will be about two thirds or so of the equity earnings that we'll get from that entity this year versus what we received last year. It just so happens the first quarter was disproportionately higher than it was compared to the first quarter of last year. But we would expect that to come back down to the levels we talked about other than the upper that we mentioned in the first quarter. They're going to come down to levels we talked about in the January call, that's still our expectation for ULA. And then lastly you asked around rev rec, revenue recognition standard that becomes effective January 1, 2018. I'll speak for myself here, Kyle, I'm starting to get insight into sort of rev rec the old way, if you will, and rev rec the new way. Our expectation and what we've disclosed in the Ks and the Qs is that we wouldn't expect to see a large change relative to our sales and/or earnings even though we are going to be changing some contracts that are currently on a delivery-based or what we call units-of-delivery-based method of sales recognition to a cost-to-cost methodology. So that will have some impacts on sort of our opening balance sheet under the new rev rec approach, as well as sort of our opening backlog position, but I wouldn't think the sort of the run rate if you will, of sales and earnings going forward would be a material difference at all and that's sort of what I'm seeing as I look at the data so far. We'll give you a whole lot more insight into that in the second quarter. And when we give you our third quarter trend information for 2018, my expectation is that we'll be able to give you a better insight as to exactly what we're expecting to see 2018's impact as a result of rev rec change, but again I wouldn't expect it to be very large.
Greg M. Gardner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Karen, we're coming up on the hour, we have time for one more question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for squeezing me in. Good afternoon. Bruce, I was hoping you could touch on cash flow and the couple of things you brought up on the call, one was the Sikorsky cash flow growth expectation into 2018, and the second is the resolution of the F-35, kind of with the trajectory there? And I want to put in context, so you have a $1 billion after-tax pension headwind to operating cash flow in 2018 that we know about; are the two things you mentioned, the F-35 and the Sikorsky, enough to give you confidence that you can grow operating cash flow exclusive of the pension after-tax?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Exclusive of the pension after-tax; I think the answer is pretty close. If you take out the planned pension contribution for next year, I think the short answer is yes to that question. We are doing the outlook right now, $6 billion for the year, 2017, we sort of teed up when we gave the $15 billion three-year goal of every year at or around $5 billion or so. With that $5 billion, I think it's pretty close; it's close enough that that'd probably be a good challenge for us to try to figure out how to make that happen.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: So, let me wrap up. Since that was our last question, I want to conclude the call today. And I'll end by reinforcing our commitment to our strategy of growth in top-line sales and strong cash generation while at the same time providing our customers with world-class solutions to their continuous challenges and delivering our stockholders long-term value creation. Thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you on the next earnings call in July. Karen, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day. And welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Gardner: Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Please join me today on the call -- joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's news release, our SEC filings and chart two on the webcharts for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. As noted, we have posted charts on our website today that are -- that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call today. All of here, hope your New Year is off to a good start. Let me begin by saying that I am extraordinarily proud of our Lockheed Martin team. Their dedication and focus enabled us to achieve outstanding program and financial performance during a dynamic year of transition and I want to thank them for their efforts. Our performance as a corporation allowed us to exceed all of our full year goals and has positioned us for future growth and to continue to deliver value to customers and stockholders in 2017. While Bruce will cover the financial results in detail a little later, I want to highlight a few noteworthy 2016 financial accomplishments from my perspective. 2016 was an exceptional year of achievement, with all of our financial metrics exceeding our expectations and in the case of sales, earnings per share and cash from operations exceeding our previous historical high watermarks. I was especially pleased with our performance in maintaining our focus on new business wins and building backlog. We received almost $19 billion in order bookings in the fourth quarter, which resulted in our achieving a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 and a year-end backlog of over $96 billion. This represents over $1 billion increase from 2015 year-end level and reflects the broad demand for our products from both domestic and international customers. Significant awards included $7.2 billion for our F-35 LRIP 10 and definitized contract action agreement, a $1.5 billion award for PAC-3 missiles defense capabilities for United States and allied military forces and $1.2 billion from the Republic of Korea Air Force to upgrade 134 of their F-16 aircraft. Our strong and growing backlog has positioned us [Technical Difficulty]. Sorry for the interruption there [inaudible] (03:57). Our strong and growing backlog has positioned us to deliver expanding sales level and outstanding financial results as we move forward. Another area where we are, it sounds like somebody is not on mute. Let me just continue. Another area where we were successful with our strategic focus on cash and cash deployment, in 2016 we generated nearly $5.2 billion in cash from operations, reflecting the commitment focus of our team in executing on contracts for our customers on a daily basis and we expect to exceed our initial three-year $15 billion commitment we originally laid out in October of 2014 by $1 billion. This strong cash generation also enabled us to continue our longstanding cash deployment strategy. In 2016, we returned 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders through our competitive dividend and ongoing share repurchase activity. Keeping with cash deployment our 2016 share repurchases exceeded $2 billion and coupled with the shares retired earlier in the year as part of our divestiture of the IS&GS business allowed us to reduce our year-end outstanding share count to below our target one full year ahead of our stated goal. These achievements reflect our ongoing commitment to perform with excellence for our customers and stockholders. Looking beyond 2016, our 2017 guidance outlined today shows that we are expecting solid organic growth and continued strong cash generation, and Bruce, will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and webcharts. I'd like to turn now to the status of DOD budget. Currently, the DOD is operating under a continuing resolution through April 28th for fiscal year 2017 with funding constrained to prior FY16 levels. While this will cause funds to be limited for certain DOD programs and likely delay expansion in others, we do not believe our 2017 sales, earnings or cash flows will be affected by this delay in receiving the full appropriations bill. We forecast that prior year's appropriation levels will support our current plans as our broad portfolio of long cycle programs remains well-aligned with our customers’ needs. Further support for this conclusion is that the continuing resolution also allows for a limited set of exceptions, which include the ability to additionally fund two of our programs, advanced procurement for new multiyear Black Hawk helicopter contract and sufficient funding to maintain the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle program launch capability and schedule. While we believe the possibility of a full-year CR still exist and would not be in the nation's best interest, we are hopeful that a resolution can be reached to maintain our country's readiness and strength. Separately, the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act was signed into law last month and reflected bipartisan agreement that defense budgets should not return to amounts defined by the Budget Control Act or sequestration levels. I am personally encouraged by that fact, but there is recognition from both parties that global security threats are not decreasing and that in fact we do need to continue to put resources toward our national security and our interoperability with our allies around the world. We look forward to the upcoming submission of the new administration's budget proposal and continued congressional support for a strong defense and future recapitalization actions both in FY 2017 and beyond. We look forward to working with the new Pentagon team as we collectively look to provide our armed forces with the capabilities needed to perform their crucial missions. I would like to continue my remarks with a few highlights from the fourth quarter that illustrate the continued upward momentum we have in our operational performance as we delivered daily on the commitments to our customers. Starting with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we delivered 16 aircraft in the fourth quarter, including the first planes for customers beyond our original eight partnered nations, Japan and Israel. These countries represent our ninth and 10th international customers, and along with South Korea show building international interest and the capabilities of this remarkable plane. In November, Luke Air Force Base welcome the arrival of its first Foreign Military Sales or FMS aircraft as Japan took ownership of its first F-35, where it will be used to train an elite cadre of Japanese air self-defense pilots and maintainers. In December I traveled to Israel to attend the delivery ceremony for the first pair of Adir F-35 stealth fighters for the Israeli Air Force. The IAF has embraced the technologies and capabilities of this fifth-generation fighter and believe it will become a powerful accelerator for their entire air force. Also during the fourth quarter our F-35 backlog grew as we received an undefinitized contract for LRIP 10, which added 90 planes to our flow. This brings our total F-35 orders to-date up to 373 planes. Just as significantly, our 2016 deliveries of 46 jets brought our total deliveries to 200 aircraft at the end of 2016. We expect 2017 to be another inflection point in our production cycle as we now anticipate delivering 66 planes, an increase of over 40% from our 2016 level. As many of you know, I have the opportunity to meet with President Trump on two occasions prior to his inauguration to discuss our F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. We along with our partners share his strong interest in producing this unparalleled aircraft at affordable prices for our warfighters and taxpayers. We believe we are on this path and I'd like to take a moment to give you a quick status of the program. At this time, I'll ask you to turn to the third page in the webcharts that we have provided. This chart depicts the F-35A model per unit price, which is the Conventional Takeoff and Landing or CTOL variant. The chart also depicts the F-35 program order quantities. The bar graph portion of the chart shows our historical and projected orders. You will also observe a dark descending line on the graph, which shows the per unit price of our CTOL variant in each LRIP as notated by the axis on the right. You can see from our latest status on our LRIP 9, our current F-35A is now around $100 million apiece and drops below $100 million for LRIP 10. The LRIP 10 price is currently proposed with represented reduction of over 60% from the first LRIP 1 aircraft and this demonstrates a learning curve as efficient as any achieved on any modern tactical fighter aircraft. The chart also includes a red dotted line, which represents the government program offices annual budget estimate to Congress of the F-35A unit price. This selected acquisition report or SAR is submitted annually to Congress as part of the yearly budgeting process in advance of our contract negotiations for each lot. As you can see we have had eight consecutive years of achieving settlement unit prices below the internal government expectations, showing our ongoing commitment to producing this aircraft with increasing affordability. You will also see the rapid ascent and quantities on the chart. It is with this anticipated trajectory and production that we can continue to see the efficiencies in touch labor, manufacturing techniques and supply chain operations that we project will allow us to meet our stated goal of offering the CTOL version for $85 million by 2019. We believe this will result in the best combination of capability and price of any aircraft ever offered, while at the same time growing valuable job opportunities for our American workforce. Turning to our Space Systems business area, I'd like to highlight another example of one of our innovative products and the benefits that can be derived from our long-term commitment to technology, our customers and their missions. In November, we successfully delivered the Lockheed Martin built GOES-R satellite to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The spacecraft was launched on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and placed into geostationary orbit 22,000 miles above the earth as the first of four in a next-generation weather satellite constellation. We are excited to be leading the GOES-R program, a collaborative mission between NASA and NOVA, which will provide major improvements to quality, quantity and timeliness of critical weather data. This constellation will improve the detection and observations of meteorological events that directly affect public safety, protection of property and ultimately economic health. I'm especially pleased that the company's Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, California contributed key instrumentation that will fly aboard each spacecraft, including the Geostationary Lightning Mapper or GLM. The GLM will take hundreds of images every second, mapping lightning activity on the earth surface and in the atmosphere. Scientists are hoping to use data from the GLM and GOES-R satellites to provide citizens and public safety officials early warning of severe storms and tornado activity. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate our Sikorsky team for delivering the 1,000th H-60M Black Hawk helicopter this past quarter at a ceremony in our Connecticut facility. This version of the Black Hawk dating back to 2007 has been consistently enhanced with more powerful engine, improved airframe and modern avionics, and it is a key element of the Army Aviation Modernization Plan. The Black Hawk has been noted as the workhorse of army aviation and including the entire Black Hawk family, Sikorsky has delivered over 4,000 Black Hawk helicopters, which have blown over 9 million flight hours. We are honored to be part of this heritage and look forward to continuing this proud legacy. In closing as I reflect back on our accomplishments over the past year, we completed our strategic actions to better align the business for operational and financial success, and long-term value creation. We increase sales, grew our backlog and had strong cash generation, while continuing to perform with excellence for our customer. Looking to the future, I am enthusiastic about our corporation’s broad portfolio and the growth opportunities that it provides both domestically and internationally. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, outline our 2017 financial guidance and then we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the webchart we included with our earnings release today. My remarks begin on chart four and an overview of our financial results for the year. Before discussing our 2016 financial results, I want to provide an understanding of the material weakness and internal controls that we described in our earnings release. This materially weakness relates to a number of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is limited to Sikorsky only. While we have not discovered any material errors in the financial results included in our earnings release today, our reviews of the internal control processes and IT-related controls over financial reporting at Sikorsky indicated a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement could have occurred that would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis, which is enough to determine that a material weakness in those internal controls exists. That finding in turn triggered a more thorough review of Sikorsky's financial statements to determine whether or not that potential for misstatement led to an actual material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements and at this time we have not found that to be the case. We expect to have completed our analysis of Sikorsky's financial statements when we file our Form 10-K in February. Thereafter, the remediation process will continue as we’ll have to correct and then test the remediated controls over several reporting cycles. We will provide updates on our progress as we file our Form 10-Qs in 2017 and we expect that the remediation will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2017. Moving on now to our 2016 results. Overall, we finish the year a little stronger than the outlook we provided to you in the October call. We obtained the highest sales, earnings per share and cash from operations that we've ever achieved, we continued our track record of returning substantial cash to our stockholders and we grew backlog to more than $96 billion, significantly strong sales volume in the year. So, overall, we are very pleased with our results for 2016 and we think this positions us well as we enter 2017. I’ll add this, also nice for me and perhaps for you as well, to have the many portfolio shaping activities that occurred during the year behind us, hopefully making it easier to both explain and follow the results of the company going forward. Turning to chart five, we compare our sales and earnings per share in 2016 versus 2015. Sales were nearly $7 billion higher this year compared with last year and most of that growth came from having a full year of Sikorsky performance and results of RMS for 2016 versus less than two months in 2015 and significant organic growth in Aeronautics driven by the F-35 program. Earnings per share grew by 25% over last year's level, driven by higher segment operating profit and FAS/CAS adjustment, the benefit from a lower tax rate and a lower share count due to share repurchases in the year and the results of the share reduction associated with the IS&GS divestiture. Within the 2016 results we also had the benefit of recognizing the booking resulting from obtaining a controlling interest in the U.K.'s Atomic Weapons Establishment that we discussed on the last call. That gain increased EPS by $0.34 for the year. Chart six shows our actual cash from operations generated in 2016 and outlook for 2017. During the October call, we discussed that our cash projection in 2016 has significant variability in it driven by about 700 million in F-35 collections that could have been received in either 2016 or 2017 and we sized our 2016 cash from operations at $5 billion or $5.7 billion. We also said that if the $700 million was not received in 2016 it would simply be added to our outlook for 2017 resulting in a two-year outlook for cash from operations of greater than or equal to $10.7 billion. As it turns out we did not received a $700 million in collections in 2016, but we did generate $5.2 billion in cash from operations even without those collections and we are keeping our 2017 outlook at the $5.7 billion level resulting in a two-year outlook of greater than or equal to $10.9 billion or $200 million more than we said in October. If you will turn to chart seven we’ll discuss the amount of cash we returned to stockholders in 2016. With our cash from operations of around $5.2 billion and capital expenditures of almost $1.1 billion, our free cash flow in 2016 was a little more than $4.1 billion and with $2.1 billion of share repurchases and $2 million of dividends paid, we returned a 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders last year. On chart eight you can see how our consistent focus on returning cash to our stockholders have resulted in a significant reduction in number of shares outstanding. We reduced our shares outstanding by 36% from our peak share count level of 456 million shares in 2002 and we achieved our goal of reducing outstanding shares to below 291 million shares one year earlier than our target date. As a reminder, we anticipate $2 million of share repurchases in 2017. Chart nine provides our 2017 outlook, our sales guidance is between $49.4 billion and $50.6 billion and our segment operating profit range is between $5.015 billion and $5.135 billion. Our FAS/CAS adjustment is $880 million for 2017 and we will discuss this in more detail on the next chart. Our earnings per share are expected to be between $12.25 and $12.55 and our cash from operations is expected to be equal to or greater than $5.7 billion as we discussed earlier and this represents a good start to achieving the goal we established in October of generating $15 billion or more of cash from operations during 2017 to 2019. On chart 10 we compare the FAS/CAS adjustment outlook that we provided in October with what we are providing now. In October, we expected an adjustment of $800 million since then interest rates increased probably our discount rates to increase to the 4.125% level by year-end, 50 basis points higher than we projected in October. The increase in discount rate increased our FAS/CAS adjustment for 2017 by $240 million and we lowered our outlook for the long-term return on our pension assets from 8% to 7.5%, recognizing the downward pressure on the equity and fixed income asset classes in our trust, lowering the long-term return on assets lowers our FAS/CAS adjustment in 2017 by $160 million, partially offsetting the increase resulting from the higher discount rate and netting to a FAS/CAS adjustment of $880 million for 2017. Chart 11 provides our sales and segment operating profit outlook ranges by the four business areas. I recall a briefing we gave in New York City at the end of 2006 where we said that the Aeronautics business area would grow from its $11 billion revenue level then to more than $20 billion by 2015. Given all that's happened since that time reaching $20 billion in 2017 still feels like a nice accomplishment for our Aeronautics team and has enabled us to forecast 2017 revenue of $50 billion at the midpoint of our guidance. And finally, we have our summary on chart 12. We achieved exceptional performance in 2016. We continued our cash deployment practices and generated strong returns for our stockholders, and we completed our portfolio shaping actions, which we believe positions us for the continued long-term value creation. With that, we are ready for your questions. Stephanie?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Cai von Rumohr: Could you basically update us in terms of where you are in your negotiations on LRIP 10 and whether you intend to basically take any legal action in terms of the way the [inaudible] (27:07) of LRIP 9 was determined?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question Cai. I will take that on and Bruce do you have anything to add you’re certainly welcome. On LRIP 10 we are very close to a deal as some of may have seen in the media I expressed that after my discussions with President Trump recently. We are very close to a deal that would allow us to close LRIP 10 in the near-term and so I expect that will be very soon. On LRIP 9, basically we are not under any pressure to do anything further on LRIP 9 at this point. We are just going to continue to look at our options on LRIP 9. Anything do you want to add Bruce?
Bruce Tanner: No, no. I think that capture it, Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ron Epstein: Yeah. Hey. Hey, good morning, guys.
Bruce Tanner: Hi.
Ron Epstein: When we perhaps think about modeling the program, the F-35 program as we go out over the next several years, I mean, one question I get a lot from investors is, I mean, how should we think about the margin profile? I guess what I am asking is one of the fears is on Lot 10 pricing, I mean, are we going to see a margin step-down or I mean, can you give us a broad way to think about the margin progression of that program?
Bruce Tanner: Hey, Ron, I will take a shot at that. So the way I think of it, Ron, we have given, I think, a very consistent speech for a number of years about our expectation that the F-35 program will have sort of sequential year-over-year margin improvement up to the point that probably we reach full rate production at which point it ought to look a lot like other production programs at that sort of thing stage of their lifecycle. And at least as I look with the expectation of where I think the agreement on LRIP 10 is going to come out. I don't think we would deviate from that discussion at this point in time, just to put in some perspective, I think, if F-35 from 2016 to 2017 the margins that we are expecting in between those two years is probably growing 90 basis points not quite 100 basis points year-over-year. I think that’s going to happen with the results that we expect to obtain on the LRIP 10 negotiation. And thereafter, I would expect that we would continue to have some margin improvement maybe not as at higher rate as we experienced from sub 2016 to 2017, but still have sequential increase in margin after the full rate production programs as we have talked about in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Rich Safran: Marillyn, Bruce, Greg, good morning. I have a question on Brexit and international, so one fallout, potential fallout from Brexit is the impact on the U.K. defense spending. I was wondering if you have had any discussions with the British Government on this topic, if you expect much of an impact. And on the topic of international, can you give us an update on the discussions you are having with international customers, for example, how they are viewing the change in administration, are you expecting a continued step-up in international demand, is there any change in emphasis on direct versus FMS, that sort of thing?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for your question Rich. I will just start with Brexit question and in terms of U.K. defense spending, I haven't had any impact and input from the U.K. MOD that they're going to move off of their strategic defense plan, they have a strategy and their normal review that they will continue to spend on their defense spending. So we haven't seen any impact from that. No indication that that’s going to change. I think just like most countries their national security is first and foremost for them and so they are going to continue to focus on that. In terms of other international customers and any reaction to the change administration. I frankly haven’t had any dialogue back from that as well. We -- as we bring in -- as we have an orderly transition of power in the United States of America, we have new leaders in the administration, they each -- they have different policies they might put forward, but it hasn’t impacted our demand for our international products, a lot of our growth on international -- in the international marketplaces in the F-35, it’s in missile defense, it’s an opportunity for F-16 and C-130J, opportunities for C4ISR, Space awareness, things of that nature and that continue -- there continues to be a demand for those. And I -- as I -- as we continue to move forward in dealing with our international customers we’re not seeing any retrenchment at all.
Bruce Tanner: Rich, you asked about the FMS and our direct commercial sale whether there was any discussions about potentially changing that are not. My suspicion is that’s not high on anyone's agenda list at this point in time and I wouldn’t expect to see any sort of policy changes towards that. Just to put it in some perspective as we’ve talked about in the past, we would expect our FMS percentage of our international sales to grow and our direct commercial sale percentage of our international business to shrink over time, primarily simply because of the F-35 program and that program is a long way from ever having the ability to sell any aircraft on a direct commercial basis and essentially all the international customers and all the growth that you're going to see from international customers and the program going forward is going to be on the FMS side of the house. And the same thing, frankly, is happening with our THAAD program, which is another large international grower. So that sort of squeezing out if you will the actual direct commercial sale business, actually direct commercial sales business isn’t shrinking in absolute terms of all that much, but the percentage is reduced because of what I just described.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Robert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi Rob.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Robert Stallard: Marillyn and Bruce, your comments on the F-35 program essentially seemed to suggest that nothing is really changing. But in the press we seem to see the DOD and the President taking a more aggressive stance. Is there a chance you are being too optimistic on this and the actual pricing on Lot 10 and beyond, and the margin could be lower than you expect?
Marillyn Hewson: Let me take that on since I have been a lot of discussions with President Trump. I only just going to frame it for you, I tried to express after those meetings, some overview of the meetings themselves, but I’ll just give you a little bit more color on it. Basically President Trump recognizes that the F-35 is a very large program, its largest program in the Department of Defense. He wants to make sure that that the American taxpayer is getting the lowest possible costs on the program and we share, we understand his concerns about affordability, we certainly share that. The meetings that we've had have been very productive, with very good dialogue. He asked excellent questions and he is really focused on making sure that that the cost comes down on the program and it is not about slashing our profit, it's not about our margins when we have those discussions about how we get the cost of the aircraft down today and in the future. So I have welcome the opportunity to talk to him, because it gives me an opportunity to share with him what we have been doing in terms of bringing the cost down as you saw on the chart that we put in our deck today that we have been driving the cost down on the program that we have invested as ourselves and our industry partners in what’s called blueprint for affordability and we're moving forward on sustainment cost reduction initiatives, so that we can continue to take cost out of the supply chain, to take cost out of our manufacturing and produce ability and materials we use as we’ve moved along on this program. And as we've done that we’ve -- I’ve also have the opportunity to share with him things that the Department of Defense can do and how they might buy the aircraft differently in the future that would help continue to drive the cost down, he open that discussion. The other thing is very important that I'm happy to have the opportunity to chat with him about is the capabilities of the F-35 brings to our minimum and uniform, I mean, it’s basically a game changer, it brings for our country, for our military, as well as for our allies around the world unmatched capability, absolutely unmatched. And recognizing that his focus is on how do we drive the cost down aggressively and we -- I think we are -- us along with our industry partners are right in line with him on doing that, we’ve got a lot of ideas on how we can do that in the future. In the meantime, we will continue on the current negotiations to come down that curve that you saw on the chart that we shared with you to continue to drive the cost down.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Hunter Keay: Thank you. Marillyn, just a follow-up to that last statement you made on the sustainment cost, are you talking about an incremental initiative here to reduce maybe some of the sustainment spending or is there may be an opposite way to think about that that as you manage this program for the next 10 years to 15 years for Lockheed that you can lower the unit cost, but perhaps, maybe recoup some of those upfront unit cost savings for DOD with actually higher sustainment revenues for you guys further down the road? How are you thinking about that balance?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, first of all, what I was discussing was the sustainment cost reduction initiatives, just like on blueprint for affordability which was focused on production costs, we along with Northrop Grumman and BAE committed some investment up front to help with getting projects underway that will continue to drive the cost down and production. We have similarly invested upfront to support the U.S. Government in driving sustainment costs down in the near-term over the next five years to drive that cost down. So that was what I was referring to. Now your question about sustainment itself, I mean, we do look at these programs in terms of their overall lifecycle costs, which is not just the development and production but it’s also sustainment and our goal is that the overall cost for the program would continue to come down.
Bruce Tanner: Hunter, maybe just to add one thing from my perspective and just to make sure that we are all clear on this. Sustainment is going to grow in the future. It has grown very significantly last few years as the aircraft is being based at various locations around the U.S. and soon to be internationally as well. So there is no doubt that sustainment will grow and the Lockheed Martin contribution towards that sustainment will grow into the future. This is about just doing sustainment smartly and doing it as economically as we can, but even if we do it is economically as we can we are still going to see some pretty significant sustainment growth in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Sam.
Sam Pearlstein: You just talk a little bit about the backlog being $96 billion. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what your expectations are for 2017 year-end backlog and maybe highlight some of the key orders you are looking at, there was some international THAAD that didn't happen in ‘16 and just if you can talk a little bit about some of the key orders to watch?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. So, thanks, Sam, there is, as we look at 2017 in all likelihood we are probably going to see a little bit of degradation in backlog. I would think maybe a couple million bucks or so for the year. Some of that is obviously dependent on, there is a couple of fairly good size competitive awards in 2017 that may or may not happen or may or may, at least may or may not happen in the year and in fact we may or may not win some of the proposals if you will. The biggest drivers we have got in terms of orders and sort of keeping the backlog level as to where it is today are a little bit less than where it is today. You should think of that the ongoing advanced funding for the F-35 program. So very early in the first half of this year we should start receiving advanced funding for the LRIP 12 aircraft which will be a pretty good size increase in terms of absolute numbers of aircraft over LRIP 11. As we just talked about with Hunter the sustainment and spares funding to support the bases around the country and the global is going to be increased in the first half of the year. We should start seeing additional GPS III satellite orders first half of the year and probably finalize the Hellfire order that didn't quite get finished last year and I expect that will take place early this year. The really big orders in the year are the LRIP 11, definitization for F-35 that's -- we are assuming in numbers that we are going to get both LRIP 10 negotiated and definitized and LRIP 11 negotiated and definitized in 2017. We have already recognized a pretty good portion of the LRIP 10 contract via the [ph] U.K. (41:30) that Marillyn talked about, but not so much on the LRIP 11, so a big, big chunk of our orders in 2017 is associated with that definitization. You mentioned the international missile defense programs I believe the largest one we’re looking and again the second half of year is the THAAD Qatar program, so the first five of THAAD battery for the Government of Qatar is also a fairly large order in the second half. And then lastly, and I believe this is actually the second largest order for the corporation in 2017, but we do expect to close on the multiyear nine Black Hawk order in the second half of this year as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Howard Rubel: Thank you very much. Marillyn, you’ve gone through a number of significant changes in the last 12 months. And you indicated you and Bruce are going to be back to living a little bit more with normal. But could you for a moment step back and kind of talk a little bit about where are some of the competitive advantages you see and how you'd like to shape the company going forward, I mean, 25% of the company is F-35, but you do have a lot of other programs and a lot of other technology opportunities?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question, Howard. As I said in my prepared remarks on the front end, I think, we're extremely well-positioned for long-term success. Yes, last year was a challenging year in terms of transitioning the divestiture of IS&GS and really moving very far along in our integration with Sikorsky and that I would say a great tribute to the team is that despite those major efforts that we had going on in the business we exceeded all of our financial commitments, as well as actually hit some new records, I mean, I think, that's a true measure and our operational performance was outstanding in terms of how we are performing for our customer, so I'm extremely pleased with that. In terms of strategically as we look forward, having Sikorsky as part of our company now, it opens up a lot of opportunities for us, we are currently in the development phase for a number of helicopter program, so we are going to move into production, so as you look at the CH-53K at the Presidential Helicopter, the work we've been doing on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter program, the combat rescue helicopter that we’re working, all of those programs, as well as what Bruce mentioned, we continuing on with the Black Hawk and getting into the next year multiyear Black Hawk is excellent growth area for us that will continue to bring good cash generation and continued growth for us as the company. And then we do expect at some point the commercial business will come back, we are at a lull right now with the oil and gas prices, but it’s another opportunity for growth for us and one of the elements of the company that we’ll look forward to continuing to grow. And so, Sikorsky has been a great asset that we brought into the company and I see great growth opportunities. We’ve talked about 35 at length, you can see, certainly it is a growth engine for our company and we continue to see growing international demand for it, so it’s not just a program of record that we have with the U.S. Government on the services that are buying the aircraft, but and the international partners that have already signed up, but many other countries are showing interest in the program. And then across the portfolio from our missile defense to the work we are doing in mission systems and training to all the elements of our fire control capability, our space systems and satellite and spacecraft. I think if you look holistically at our portfolio we are very strong in all of those areas and represent a leader in and virtually every one of those markets. So from a competitive advantage standpoint I think our goal is to continue to perform with excellence on the programs that we have today and to continue to look for opportunities to keep our portfolio relevant to continue to invest in research and development and innovation so that we stay on the forefront. I think innovation for us is the lifeline of this company. What we’re doing in our independent research and development, what we’re providing to our current customers and what we’re looking at and providing for long-term investments for the long-term and things like hypersonic and directed energy and other things. And then as you're probably aware we set up a venture fund where we’re also taking positions in companies that we see is another seeding of our innovation into our company. I would lastly say that from a competitive advantage standpoint my view is that that it is the talent in this company that is the competitive advantage. We have the best talent in the industry in my view from and that in my view sets us apart. So that couple with the technology and the outstanding portfolio, I think, sets us up very well for continued success and continued growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Marillyn, it sounds like border taxation was discussed during your meeting yesterday with other business leaders and I'm just curious as it applies to your own business and to the defense landscape, do you have a sense as to -- a clear sense as to how this is going to impact your business in the sector, does it sound like the President is a supporter of no tax on exports and could you just describe how it would impact Lockheed the way you see it? Thanks.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question, Myles. And I guess, I would step back from his yesterday and what you’ve heard from him in his campaign is that his focus is on not having work go offshore to be produced and then brought back into the United States that are -- and have the company have the advantage of producing it elsewhere. So if you take the Lockheed Martin, I mean, we are not, we produce our products in the U.S., predominantly of our roughly [ph] 98,000 (48:04) employees over 90,000 are here in the U.S. This is where we produce our products and then we deliver them around the world. And those that are producing another parts of the world whether it’s in the U.K. or in Canada or Australia, the work that we might be doing there is not being imported back into the U.S. So I don't see that this border taxation issue affects us as a company and I think it’s more geared toward commercial companies that might decide to do the production offshore and then sell their products back into the U.S.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. May be Myles just to add it from my perspective, so anytime you're talking about reducing taxes on exports, we’re -- we have a fairly good amount of exports and we don't frankly import a whole lot, so we would probably be a net benefiter from a tax perspective relative to that were to happen. I think if you look at either one of the tax proposal as sort of being tossed around. The current one you just discussed, as well as the one that the house put forward later or earlier, excuse me, middle part of last year or so. In virtually either one of those scenarios the statutory rate drops pretty significantly and for Lockheed Martin the U.S. domiciled company with most of our income, as Marilyn said, coming from U.S. locations. We don't have the sort of offshore issues that a lot of the global companies would and so we would be a benefiter or benefactor probably either one of those tax policies going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Noah Poponak: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Noah.
Noah Poponak: Marillyn, I wanted to ask if you could maybe provide a little more detail or I guess thought around the total U.S. defense budget commentary you touched on briefly in your prepared remarks. I mean, I guess, where would [ph] Japan (50:16) the actual likelihood that sequestration is removed from DOD versus the need to have some kind of compromise where they, I guess, still, I guess, I'm not as sure, but still seemingly still deficit focused Congress and if this is happening will we see it in the ‘18 request or does the administration need another year and half to have it be fully their own and be prepared to do that?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question, Noah. I guess, I will just give you my opinion because that's really all I can do at this point is pretty unpredictable as we go forward and as you indicated. My opinion is though that there's appears to be bipartisan support for eliminating sequestration. As I’ve said in the past, we have a lot of independent dialogues with various members of Congress, every one I've ever spoken to [Technical Difficulty] they don't think it's good policy and they want to get rid of it. So I think now with the current Congress and the new administration that it probably opens up the opportunity for really getting that done and I'm very encouraged that the dialogue has been around eliminating the defense sequester, just removing it altogether and there's also a strong discussion around increasing defense spending, because we have for the last few years allowed our -- with that budget caps et cetera, we have not been investing like we need to in recapitalization and then and readiness and a lot of things that you hit directly from our customers, our services telling Congress and telling the new administration that they need. So we are very supportive of our defense customers and being a voice around that, because we do think it's important to eliminate the sequester and the budget caps associated with it to allow them to do, to address the national security strategies and to provide a right capability for minimum and uniform. In terms of where it might come into play, I mean, I -- again, I'm encouraged by the fact that there is some discussions around supplemental to the FY17 budget, there's some discussions around getting after this whole issue of sequester and eliminating the budget caps. So whether it’s in ’18 request or in the early ’17, it’s hard for me to predict, but I think it will be near-term and longer term, because everyone that I speak to has recognized and certainly President Trump has recognized that it's something that needs to go away and we need to get on with spending the appropriate amount, having adequate budgets to support our national security.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.
Jason Gursky: Good morning, everyone. Bruce, Marillyn, I was wondering if you wouldn't do us a favor and walk through each of the segments and maybe provide a little bit of color on the risks and opportunities this year relative to your official outlook?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Jason. Let -- Bruce why don’t you walk through and then if I have anything to add on.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. Let me do that and Jason, if I don’t quite capture what you are looking for get back and shout out at me there. But maybe just starting with Aeronautics, largest business, obviously, portfolio. So on the sales side we’re expecting sequential growth quarter-over-quarter, so fourth quarter will be the highest quarter of the year first quarter as is typical in Aeronautics will be the lowest quarter of the year. From sort of the comparison to 2016, I would expect sort of the rate of growth or the percentage of growth over ‘16 to sort of diminish a little bit as we go through the year even though the numbers will get bigger and that's in part because we are going to see a little bit albeit the F-16 program comes to an end in the late second quarter or early third quarter, if this is the last eight aircraft deliveries that we have in backlog right now and until we get another country to buy the F-16 that will be the last those production aircraft, so that’s going to be a little bit lower in the second half of the year than the first half, but still pretty significant growth quarter-over-quarter for Aeronautics and obviously most of that driven by the F-35 program. I think EBIT during the year probably follows the sales volume as we look at least right now pretty consistent margins quarter-over-quarter, that obviously, it is dependent upon when we have the timing of risk retirements occurring throughout the year, but with the planned risk retirements we have in the outlook right now it says that the margins are fairly consistent going throughout the year. May be jumping to missiles and fire control, expect the first quarter to be maybe a little bit lower than perhaps you're expecting, first quarter is going to be quite a bit lower than the rest of the other three quarters of the year, you should think of that as the timing of deliveries that had both and especially if you are comparing it to the fourth quarter of 2016 we had a lot more deliveries in the second half of 2016 and we expect to see in the first quarter of 2017, and so that drop off you'll notice I think when we come out with our results at the end of the first quarter. The next three quarters are quite a bit higher than the fourth quarter and they are actually pretty consistent as we look at the outlook right here for the next year or so, low in the first quarter, next three much higher and the next three fairly consistent with each other. Similar to Aeronautics, the EBIT kind of follows the sales volume because we do expect a fairly consistent margin between quarters in 2017. Rotary and Mission Systems 2017 kind of similar to Aeronautics, we do expect sequential growth quarter-over-quarter. Probably, also EBIT tracking for sales but we also expect that the margin quarter-over-quarter will increase, so we'll see some increases as we go throughout the year within the margins within RMS and this is a little bit of the wind down of some of the purchase accounting and intangible -- not intangible amortization but the integration costs associate with Sikorsky, as well as the timing of some of our planned risk retirements in 2017 causing that effect. And then, lastly, Space, in 2017 actually almost draw straight line across the quarters, roughly $2.2 billion there about every single quarter of the year is what we are expecting. There's no commercial launches or commercial satellites with sales that we would book upon delivery like we had in 2016. We actually had two commercial launches all in the year and we have zero plan for this year, so you won’t kind of see the spike associate with those deliveries as we saw in 2016 so I am a little more consistent there. EBIT again kind of follow sales volume is probably little more variability than that and this is really associate with the timing of equity earnings as we progressed throughout the year. So hopefully that captures that in terms of how we look at that. Obviously, as we look at the year and I always give this speech at the start of, it’s seems every year, that's based on the opportunities that are built into our plan. And as I always like to say, as we look at the opportunities in 2017 and compare those to what we saw in 2016, the potential for doing better is about the same as what we saw in 2016 or for that matter in 2015 but we have to make that happen in 2017 for that to come to fruition and again that's not in the numbers or the planning that we just talked about to you.
Greg Gardner: Stephanie, I believe we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Spingarn: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of cleanup things on F-35, Marillyn, if we go back to the sustainment discussion, in your discussion, in your negotiations with DOD on LRIP 10 and on anything else, has there been any consideration to defer future competition for either F-35 sustainment or for the Block 4 subsystem upgrade work? And Bruce, how is this potential competition contemplated in your long-term outlook for the aircraft? And then the last thing I wanted to ask you is how important is the 450 unit international block buy to the margin growth cadence that you described to Ron earlier?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question, Rob. I guess, the first question on sustainment, sustainment is a separate contract from the LRIP 10, so it isn’t part of the discussion at all in LRIP 10 negotiations nor would be the upgrade work for Block 4 going forward…
Robert Spingarn: But might they factor into any horse trading or anything that you all are talking about?
Marillyn Hewson: Actually no we treat them separately as separate contracts, we look at what the sustainment contract is versus the LRIP 10, I mean, there are just, the separate LRIP 10 is pretty straightforward, as we look at our assessment of the costs associated with LRIP 10 and offer that we put forward based on the cost of the aircraft and the terms and conditions associated with that contract. It doesn't include sustainment.
Bruce Tanner: Rob, let me try, I jotted down your questions. Hopefully, I captured them well. But as far as the future competition for sustainment block, if that happens and look competition is the buzzword that everyone talks about these days. We are not afraid of competition. We think the legacy of performance that we have both with the software development on the program, as well as what we've done so far in sustainment and we -- what we plan to do with as Marillyn said, some of the cost reduction initiatives on sustainment. We think we are incredibly well-positioned in both of those if in fact they are competed and our assumption would be that we would win those competitions and that is embedded in our planning if you will. I think you also asked about the block buy and the importance of the 450 aircrafts, potential block buy relative to margins. Not so much benefit on the margins that we are contemplating, Rob, as much as helping secure long-term commitments from suppliers, long-term planning for our own work inside our own factory such that can hopefully get and with the benefits are sort of an economic order quantity associated with that block buy that we can get the price of the aircraft or the cost of the aircraft down just as what Marillyn’s talked about relative to her conversations with the President. I mean that is one of the items that was addressed in those conversations is what can we and the government do to get the cost of the aircraft down and that is clearly one of the things that can do that. You get -- if you look at any sort of multiyear or block buy or economic order quantity, there are always savings associated with that, the only question is how much are those savings and we think we have a very good plan in place relative to the block buy to bring the cost down going forward. But I wouldn’t expect that that expectation on our part of lower cost would be sort of priced in to that block buy if you will. So I wouldn’t expect to see necessarily margin spike associate with that.
Marillyn Hewson: So with that -- with our last question let me conclude the call today. I want to end up the call by just reiterating that 2016 was truly an extraordinary year of transition and success, and our team performed exceptionally well in all phases, strategically, operationally and financially. As we look into 2017, our strong backlog and solid portfolio have the corporation positioned for bright future of topline growth and increasing cash flows. Thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking you at our next earnings call in April. Stephanie, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference. You may all disconnect and everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin third quarter 2016 earnings results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our third quarter results. As today's release details, we continued to move forward financially, operationally, and strategically while delivering critical solutions to customers and returning value to stockholders. In addition to our discussion of financial results and outlooks, I want to highlight a few operational accomplishments in our business areas and other key events in the quarter, including DOD budget status and the successful disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business. Looking at the summary financials, our team continued to deliver strong results across the corporation, with third quarter sales, continuing operations profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations all exceeding internal plans. We are driving towards achievement of full-year 2016 goals and we are looking forward to another strong year in 2017, fueled by top line growth in our streamlined core business areas. Bruce will provide a detail review of the financial results, 2016 full year outlook, 2017 preliminary trends outlook, and assumptions in his comments later in the call. The first area I want to speak to is our cash generation and deployment. This quarter, we achieved over $1.3 billion in cash from operations, bringing September year-to-date cash generation to approximately $4.5 billion. While we have achieved strong year-to-date cash performance, I would note that our fourth quarter outlook contains a higher than normal level of significant F-35 cash timing events. Successful closure of these events are dependent on completion of various contractual negotiations before the end of the year. During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved two key actions in the area of cash deployment. First, the quarterly dividend was increased to $1.82 per share and $7.28 annually. This action represents the 14th consecutive year that the dividend rate has been increased by a double-digit percentage. Second, share repurchase authority was increased by $2 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to over $4 billion at the end of the third quarter. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to make significant future share repurchases. In recent actions taken by our board, these will enable us to continue our shareholder-friendly focus on returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit. Before examining our third quarter results, I wanted to briefly touch on the status of the fiscal year 2017 DOD and federal budgets. The government is currently operating under a short-term continuing resolution through December 9 that limits expenditures to prior-year fiscal levels. While we cannot predict budget resolution timing, we are hopeful that Congressional deliberations can be concluded as soon as possible. While we think it unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full FY 2017 year should the varying budget positions remain unresolved. In the event of a full-year CR, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2017 orders and associated backlog level, but minimal impact to sales, earnings, and cash flows in 2017, as a large portion of our backlog work is already funded from prior fiscal years. There are multiple and differing budget scenarios under consideration for the FY 2017 budgets. Significant differences remain in the various proposed budgets funding sources and the potential use of overseas continuing operations funds for additional DOD base budget. Reconciliation of the different DOD budget positions remains unresolved and could remain this way for some time. We hope this is not the case because it is not in the best interest of our nation. A substantial delay would require an extension of the CR to enable continuation of government operations beyond December 9. We continue to urge bipartisan negotiation and resolution of FY 2017 budgets to remove the uncertainty resulting from non-strategic short-term government funding actions. Moving to operations, while there were numerous mission success events across the corporation this quarter, I will limit my comments to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The highlight of the quarter was the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing model [CTOL] being declared combat-ready by the U.S. Air Force and achieving initial operational capability, or IOC. This declaration reflects the maturity and performance of the CTOL aircraft and successful achievement of all key criteria to reach IOC readiness. The IOC enables the U.S. Air Force to be the second branch of the military to field combat-ready F-35 aircraft, as they join the U.S. Marine Corps with their operational F-35B aircraft in providing unequaled fifth-generation fighters to our nation and allies. With over 70% of the more than 3,000 aircraft production plan for the F-35 being the CTOL variant, achievement of IOC for this aircraft strengthens the foundation for future decades of fighter production for domestic and international customers. In addition to the achievement of the IOC milestone, the F-35 also demonstrated the benefit of its unique fusion fused sensors in its first live fire missile intercept event. By leveraging a U.S. Marine Corps F-35 and the U.S. Navy's Aegis weapons system, the aircraft demonstrated the ability of the F-35 to greatly expand the target identification and acquisition range in its support of Naval Integrated Fire Control Missions. The F-35 served as an elevated sensor and detected an over-the-horizon missile threat. It then utilized its advanced data link to send data to an Aegis weapons system that subsequently engaged and destroyed the target. This fusion of sensors across multiple systems only begins to outline the potential enhanced war fighting capabilities and distributed lethality that F-35 aircraft will enable across our military forces. This capability is embedded in all F-35 variants today and is just one of the revolutionary technologies that this aircraft bring to our nation and allies. Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35, key milestones this past quarter included rollout of the first F-35A aircraft for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, marking a major milestone in Japan's enhanced national security defense and strengthening the future of the U.S./Japan security alliance. Japan continues to reflect a planned procurement of 42 aircraft for their national defense requirements. Beyond the activities for Japan, Norway became the first international partner nation to state its intention to participate in a multiyear, multinational block buy of the F-35. Norway outlined a request for 12 F-35 fighters in their 2017 budget and remains on track to their stated plan to purchase a total of 52 aircraft for their national defense. We're honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies, as we collectively field this fifth-generation fighter for decades to come. I'd like to turn to a different topic and provide you a status report on one of the strategic goals we outlined to you two years ago. At the time, we challenged ourselves to expand our focus and footprint overseas and established a goal to achieve 25% of annual sales from international customers. Due to the change in our portfolio content resulting from the acquisition of Sikorsky and the disposition of IS&GS, we are on track to exceed that goal later this year, as the remaining business areas perform a significantly higher proportion of international work than did IS&GS. International work across the corporation is expanding, especially in the areas of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, C-130J cargo planes, and tactical missiles. The aging of equipment in allied countries, coupled with an expanding level of global security needs, are creating significant demand for our portfolio of products in multiple regions around the world. Our proven and cost-effective solutions are securing awards from new customers worldwide. We are seeing demand for our equipment, ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East theaters. This demand helps strengthen growth, as our international portfolio is growing at a faster rate than the DOD budget. Higher international work is also providing greater economies of scale that enhances our ability to improve the affordability of platforms and services to both domestic and international customers. We're expanding our efforts across all of our business areas to provide our products to international customers. With this focus remaining a key element in our growth strategy for the corporation, we now expect to increase our international sales content to at least 30% of total annual sales in the next few years. I am confident that we have the portfolio, strategy, and personnel to achieve this new higher level as we move forward. I want to conclude my comments by recognizing one of the key accomplishments this past quarter, the successful completion of our strategic disposition of the IS&GS business to Leidos. Closure of the disposition through a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust better positions that business to generate shareholder value and opportunities for employees as they move forward outside our corporation. This RMT transaction generated the highest value-creation benefits to our stockholders and allows us to focus even more intensely on our remaining core DOD portfolio. Completion of the transaction enabled retirement of over 9 million shares of our stock through the exchange offer plus receipt of $1.8 billion in cash to our corporation. We are deploying that cash through dividends, share repurchases, and debt retirement, and are on track for full deployment of the cash before the end of this year. I'll close by stating that we have taken significant actions over the past year to reshape our portfolio and strengthen our core defense business. I'm confident that this positions us well to grow and deliver long-term value to our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Our third quarter performance builds upon our strong first half results, and we are ahead of our plan on all key financial measures through the first three quarters of the year. As you are aware, we completed the split-off of the IS&GS business area during the quarter, and both our current and historical results are now stated on a continuing operations basis. During the second quarter call, we also identified several other events that we expected to occur in the third quarter that would impact our financial results, and we'll provide an update on these events in the coming charts. And we'll provide our updated 2016 outlook, taking into consideration all of these items in subsequent charts. So we're pleased with our strong results in the quarter and with our outlook for the year in total. Turning to chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter with the third quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.5 billion or 15% this year than last year. And similar to the second quarter, the growth was driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of RMS [Rotary and Mission Systems] for about $1.2 billion and over $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by higher F-35 volume. Segment operating profit was about $180 million higher than last year, with the growth coming primarily from Space Systems as a result of better performance and the book gain associated with the consolidation of AWE [Atomic Weapons Establishment] that we will discuss in more detail on the next chart. Chart 5 highlights the key financial events impacting earnings in the quarter that we previewed during the July call. From a continuing operations perspective, the largest impact was a $127 million book gain associated with our obtaining a controlling interest in AWE that resulted in a $0.34 favorable impact in the quarter and the year. That gain was partially offset by the initial amortization of an intangible asset associated with the gain, which reduced EPS in the quarter by $0.01 and $0.06 for the year. The intangible amortization will continue on an accelerated basis over the next eight years. Next, we moved the FAS/CAS pension adjustment associated with IS&GS into discontinued operations, and that lowered EPS by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.15 for the year. And we updated our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments in the quarter, which lowered EPS by $0.02 in both the quarter and the year. We are substantially complete with the purchase accounting for Sikorsky and do not expect significant changes as we close this effort in the fourth quarter. All told, these impacts to continuing operations EPS added $0.27 in the quarter and $0.11 for the year. In discontinued operations, we recognized the book gain of about $1.2 billion associated with the disposition of IS&GS as well as their 2016 operating results up until the August disposition date. These two items amounted to $4.32 of EPS in the quarter and $4.97 for the year. If you'll turn to chart 6, we'll see how our earnings per share in the quarter compared with the EPS from one year ago. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.61, which was aided by the $0.27 benefit we described in the prior chart. In addition, the third quarter benefited from improved operating performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment, a lower tax rate, and lower share count than in the third quarter of 2015. On chart 7, you can see our cash from operations this quarter compared to last year. Cash in the quarter was around $1.3 billion, about $200 million lower than the third quarter of 2015, and continues to be impacted by our decision to fund F-35, LRIP 9, and LRIP 10 in excess of the amount of government funding. At the end of the quarter, that exposure was $950 million. While we did receive additional funding for LRIP 9 during the quarter, that funding was not sufficient to match the growth in both LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 expenditures in the quarter, resulting in the increased exposure from the second quarter. We remain hopeful that this situation will be resolved soon but have concerns with receiving collections before year end, as we'll discuss when we show our revised outlook for the year in a few charts. Chart 8 shows the amount of cash returned to stockholders on a year-to-date basis. With just under $4.5 billion in cash from operations year to date and about $600 million in capital expenditures, our free cash flow so far this year is around $3.8 billion. With $1.5 billion in dividends and $1.3 billion in shares repurchased to date, we have returned $2.8 billion to stockholders or 73% of free cash flow. And in the third quarter, we increased both our dividend rate and share repurchase authority, as Marillyn highlighted in her comments earlier. On chart 9, you can see the significant reduction in our share count over time. From our peak share count of 456 million shares in 2002, we've reduced shares outstanding to 293 million, 36% less than we had at the peak. And adjusting our previously stated goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017, for the 9 million of share reductions from the RMT exchange offer, we expect to achieve the restated goal of 291 million shares by the end of this year, a year earlier than planned. Chart 10 provides the updated outlook for the year. On the chart, we have three columns. The first shows the outlook we provided during the second quarter call. The middle column shows the same outlook adjusted for the removal of IS&GS results, and the third column shows the revised outlook compared with the middle column. We increased our sales outlook above the high end of the previous guidance to $46.5 billion, and this was driven primarily by higher sales expectations for Aeronautics and Space Systems. Segment operating profit was also increased above the high end of the previous guidance, also driven by Aeronautics and Space Systems. We increased earnings per share from continuing operations to around $12.10, reflecting the strong third quarter results. And we are giving two views of cash from operations, one assuming we do collect billings for the F-35 program before year end, and one assuming those collections slip into 2017. Assuming we do collect F-35 billings, our cash outlook is greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, a $350 million improvement over the restated second quarter outlook. And this improvement reflects strong cash performance at RMS, Space Systems, and Missiles and Fire Control. If the F-35 collections slip into 2017, our outlook for 2016 would be greater than or equal to $5 billion. The $700 million difference in the outlooks would be a digital event at year end. If it slips out of 2016, 2017 will be $700 million higher. If it does not, 2016 will be $700 million higher, but the total cash between the two years will not change, and we'll elaborate more on that in a few charts. Chart 11 shows our prior sales outlook compared with the current outlook by business area. Compared with the midpoint of our previous guidance, we're increasing our sales outlook by $900 million, with Space Systems and Aeronautics driving the change. Space Systems increased due to the consolidation of AWE results into our financial statements, while Aeronautics grew due primarily to continued higher than expected sales performance on the F-35 program. Chart 12 provides the same outlook update for our segment operating profit. As with sales, the segment operating profit outlook was driven by increases in Aeronautics and Space Systems. The increase in Aeronautics was driven primarily by the additional F-35 sales volume and improved performance across several programs. The increase in Space Systems was driven by the AWE consolidation gain as well as improved performance in government satellites. On chart 13 we provide our preliminary trend information for 2017. We expect sales to increase around 7% above the 2016 level, with most of the increase coming from Aeronautics's growth, driven by F-35 production and sustainment and Missiles and Fire Control growth driven by higher air missile defense sales. RMS and Space Systems about offset each other next year, with slight growth in RMS being offset by lower sales in Space Systems, as the additional AWE volume for a full year in 2017 compared to a partial 2016 is more than offset by lower volume in our government satellite business as well as the absence of any commercial launch activity next year. We expect segment operating margin to range between 10% to 10.5%, with the reduction from the 2016 level driven primarily by a full year of consolidated AWE sales in 2017 without the benefit of the gain in 2016, lower ULA [United Launch Alliance] equity earnings due to the mix and volume of launch vehicles expected in 2017 as well as the end of the $40 million annual deferred gain in 2016, and the significant volume increase in F-35 sales at a lower margin rate than the average for the corporation. Cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, again assuming the F-35 collections slide into 2017. We'll provide more color on our longer-term views on cash from operations on the next chart. And we're planning to have at least $2 billion of share repurchases next year, which we expect will further reduce our share count below the 290 million share level. Our updated pension outlook assumes a FAS/CAS adjustment of $800 million of income, higher than we discussed during the second quarter call. Interest rates have risen slightly since the last call, and we now see a discount rate of 3.625% rather than the 3.5% we mentioned last quarter. In addition, a new longevity table was published late last week that results in another improvement to the FAS/CAS projection we provided last quarter. On the next two charts, we provide a longer-term view of both cash from operations and our pension impacts. Beginning with chart 14 and our longer-term trend for cash from operations, during the third quarter of 2014, we established a goal of generating more than $15 billion of total operating cash for the years 2015 to 2017, significantly higher than prior years, as we were expecting what we call a pension funding holiday for that three-year period. As you can see from the chart, assuming the F-35 collections slip into 2017 and based on our 2-year view of cash for 2016 and 2017, we expect to generate around $15.8 billion over the 3-year timeframe, significantly exceeding the 2014 goal. If we look forward to the next 3 years beginning with 2017, we also except to generate at least $15 billion of total operating cash between 2017 and 2019, with all years at or near $5 billion even after we begin to make required pension contributions in both 2018 and 2019. On chart 15, we provide a view of our expectations for both the FAS/CAS adjustment and cash implications of our pension plan over a longer timeframe. All of our projections on this chart assume an 8% return on assets every year and a constant discount rate of 3.625%. As most of you know, we have a significant prefunding balance that represents the difference between our pension contributions as required by ERISA and the recovery of those contributions via our CAS billings to the government. At the end of 2016, we expect that prefund credit balance to be around $7 billion. And we expect to recover a sizable portion of that $7 billion through the year 2025, which means that our CAS recoveries should exceed required pension contributions in all years through 2025, providing a cash tailwind even during years with required contributions. And as many of you also recall, our pension plan was modified in 2014 in a two-step process that results in the plan becoming fully frozen at the end of 2019. The first step of the plan modification began in 2016 with the freeze to the salary levels used to calculate pension benefits. This means that between 2017 and 2019, our FAS expense will decrease while our CAS expense increases to recognize the recovery of the prefund balance. At the end of 2019, we have the second step of our plan modification of freezing of the years of service used to calculate pension benefits. And at this point, the plan becomes fully frozen. Beginning in 2020, we will no longer have service accruals for our salaried workforce, and this creates a number of changes to our FAS/CAS adjustment because of the full freeze. We will no longer recognize service costs for the frozen plan, and the amortization period for previous actuarial losses or gains will be extended from roughly 9 years to about 18 years in length. The combination of these changes will likely result in FAS income rather than FAS expense beginning in 2020, as our expected FAS asset returns will exceed the cost elements in our FAS calculation. This means we would expect to have considerable FAS/CAS adjustment income growth between 2017 to 2019 and then see significantly higher FAS/CAS adjustment income beginning in 2020 going forward for the foreseeable future based on current assumptions. That leads us to our summary on chart 16. We had strong operational and financial performance in the quarter and expect to finish the year in a similar fashion. We completed the IS&GS RMT transaction in a manner that was beneficial to the IS&GS business and Lockheed Martin stockholders. The strategic actions we've taken over the past year have strengthened our portfolio and will enable us to fund for future growth. And we have long-term trends and cash from operations and pension impacts that position us to continue to deliver value to our stockholders. With that, we're ready for your questions. Andrea?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much and good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the LRIP negotiations. I'm sure there's not a lot of detail you can go into. But can you talk in general terms maybe about what the sticking points here are? I know it's gone on for many months longer than expected. Do you see, Bruce, any risk to the margin guidance you've given or maybe any upside to the margin guidance you've given based on how those negotiations pan out, or is that not really what's on the table now?
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Let me just start with the negotiations. This is a very large contract. It's the largest contract to date on the program. So there's a lot of data, there's a lot of work that has to happen in those types of negotiations. And we are making progress and both parties want to get this contract right, so it takes time to do that. So I would say we continue to make progress on it. Bruce, do you want to cover the margin side?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Yeah, thanks for the question. You asked what were the sticking points here. And I'll say they're the typical points that enter into every contractual negotiation. They revolve around what's the cost to perform the contract, what are the terms and conditions associated with that contract, and what's the profit level for the contractor for performing that contract. And I'd say we haven't really reached closure on any of those three, but we're making progress every day towards that closure, so still hopeful we'll close soon. I think the latter part of your question was were there risks to the margins, and you should think at least the near-term margins are really impacted by contracts that were negotiated much prior to LRIP 9 and LRIP 10. So especially 2016 and 2017 have very little if anything to do with the margin performance in LRIP 9 and LRIP 10. So latter years obviously are much greater impacted. We're still looking to have margins on the F-35 program eventually get to mirror or mimic what we've seen in the similar life cycle of the F-16 programs and C-130 programs, and that's still our objective as we sit here today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hi, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can I ask a question on the capital deployment or cash deployment? I think, Marillyn, you said you're in a position to disposition the Leidos dividend through the end of the year. And I think, Bruce, you said you'd overachieve the share repurchase reduction by the end of this year. Just a clarification, how much do you intend to repo through the end of the year? And did, Bruce, you mean 291 million diluted share count at the end of the year or period end share count? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: So good questions, Myles. On the capital deployment side, we're still looking at about $2 billion for the year. I think we've had a little bit of benefit. We still have – we haven't talked about it in a while. We still have some remaining options eligible to be exercised, and those options are just proving to be a lot sticker in the past few years than they have been in the years previously. So we're getting some benefit from where we had plan levels of option exercise just coming in lighter than expected. You talked about the $1.8 billion on the Leidos special cash payment. So we've spent most of that through the first three quarters. I want to say it's around 400-some-odd million dollars. I know it's a little less than that as we sit here today. We made the debt retirement of about $0.5 billion in the month of September, and a pretty good chunk of it has gone towards share repurchases and dividends, including the third quarter dividend that we just made. So our expectation is that we will have consumed the full $1.8 billion in capital allocations by the end of the year. And I'm sorry, you asked one other question, Myles, about the 291 million shares. Was that an average or was that the point estimate at the end of the year? It is the year-end view as far as shares outstanding.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning, Noah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Bruce, the 7% total company revenue growth in 2017, can you tell us what that is organically? It looks like AWE is not apples to apples maybe by about 2%. Is that right, and is there anything else? And then I just wondered if you all could speak to your view of the sustainability of whatever that organic revenue growth rate is on a multiyear basis, in your view.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: I'll take a shot at that, Noah. So I think you're pretty close to being right. So I think you should think of the AWE, which I'm not sure if that's organic or inorganic, by the way, but you should think of AWE as contributing about roughly $400 million in sales this year, probably growing to a little over $1 billion – $1.1 billion next year, so maybe $700 million of change. So that's probably a little less than 2%. So we would think the growth organically as you describe it from year over year is probably in the high 4s, maybe a little bit around 5% or so next year. Going forward for the next three years or so, we still believe – we talked about in the second quarter call that we think we have growth ranging from about 3% to 5% in the out years. We still feel good about that, although it's probably not as steady over those years as you might think. So we have a bigger uptick that we're expecting in 2017, a lot of that driven by the F-35 program. We see additional growth in 2018, also by F-35, but there's a countervailing issue happening because we have the end of the F-16 production line and the end of C-5 deliveries, both of which occur in 2018. So while we still see growth – organic growth in 2018, it will be a little bit diminished because of those two events, but still better than we've seen for the last few years. And then frankly, as we sit here today and look at the longer term, 2019 is a higher growth rate than 2018, in part because of the absence of those two events.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Marillyn, Bruce, Jerry, good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: There are a lot of questions out there about what happens after your pension funding holiday expires in 2018, so I thought a bit. I ask about slide 14. It shows some significant gains even when you resume your pension contributions. And what I wanted to know was have your pension contributions declined a lot? I had thought that you were talking about numbers north of $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion in 2018. So I thought maybe you'd comment on how you're able to generate the cash flows that you're discussing today in the slide.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: I'll take that one, Rich. So you're right. And I think just from conversations that we've had at conferences and with investors as they toured through Bethesda, there was a lot of misunderstanding perhaps relative to our ability to continue to generate cash flow from operations when we started having pension contributions. So we wanted to tee up that we do think we're going to continue to have strong cash from operations, which is the reason why we came up with a new goal, essentially the same as the old goal for a three-year period with a common 2017 in both of those three-year goals. The amount of pension contributions, we have zero in 2017. For all intents and purposes, we have some minor contributions relative to the Sikorsky collective bargaining pension plan, but for all intents and purposes that's pretty minimal. In 2018 and 2019, that's still a little fluid at this point in time, but you should think of both of those years probably ranging between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of pension contributions. So we are able to essentially mimic what we did with the pension funding holiday because we do expect to have organic, if I could use that term, operational cash growth. And most of that comes from the F-35 program going forward, the Sikorsky business, which we've described as treading water for a number of years from a cash flow perspective. And then as we finish a lot of the development programs and a couple of the loss programs frankly that we have within Sikorsky, we expect to see a return to cash generation. And then the last one is the international growth that we talked about, sorry, that Marillyn talked about earlier. So those three elements and then everyone else holding constant is contributing mightily towards that level. And then I'll remind you maybe – I know you know this, Rich, but while we do make those pension contributions, and that's a hit to operating cash, they're also tax deductible, so it's a 35% offset to what we see there as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good morning, Bruce and Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hi, Peter.
Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): One to Marillyn, I guess your comments on the 25% international. I can remember back when it was down in the low teens, and obviously you've had the benefit here of some of the portfolio shaping that boosted that. But I wanted to just get at my comment on the visibility around that. When you look at that number continuing to grow and with the goal of getting it out to 30%, how much – if we think about 2017 what's already in backlog or what you have to win when you look at that kind of percentage on the international just given the concerns about sometimes there's delays on those contracts?
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks for the question, Peter. I would say the biggest growth area for us is the F-35. Certainly we've got a lot of international sales on the F-35, and so that will be the largest one. The second one is on missile defense. We've seen a lot of demand expanding for missile defense in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East as well as in Europe. So THAAD and Aegis, Aegis Ashore, Patriot, MEADS. Last year our international sales were almost $9.6 billion. And so when you think about the backlog that we've also been building over time, it's around 30% of that. Thirty percent of our backlog is international today. So we've got a lot of quality booked business that will come in toward those international sales. And so I think our portfolio is really well positioned for growth. We continue to have a pull for not only missile defense but munitions and other things in the market, particularly in the Middle East. And we're seeing growing interest in things like helicopters in Poland and, as I mentioned earlier, the C-130J in markets that we hadn't been in before like France and Germany. So we expect that we'll continue to have a pull for international growth.
Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Welcome back, Peter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, everyone; Bruce, just a quick clarification question and then one for Marillyn. Clarification question, the international revenue streams that you see coming down the pike here, do you think that these will be margin accretive for you given the mix? And then, Marillyn, can you just spend a few minutes on missile defense as it relates to international? Talk a little bit about the competitive environment, the partnering environment, and how you see this market developing over time. Which products are you going to be leading with, participating in? And does it really matter to you which products eventually come out on top from a competitive perspective?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Okay, Jason, I'll take the first one on what you describe as the international revenue stream, and I think the question was whether that was margin accretive or not. You should think of most of the – in fact, just the overwhelming majority of the growth in the international business going forward as being FMS or Foreign Military Sales in nature, as opposed to direct commercial sales in nature. And frankly, most of that growth, think of that on programs like the F-35 and the PAC-3 missile and the THAAD air missile defense system. Most of those are being negotiated. Even though they're FMS, most of are being negotiated concurrently with the U.S. government's needs. So I would not expect to see huge benefits margin-wise from the growth that we're seeing in the international business. Some of that may materialize. We're starting to see pockets of direct commercial sales within that 30%. And to the extent that that happens, that's usually at a higher margin than the FMS, but not hugely accretive would be my overall take.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: So, Jason, on your questions around missile defense, the lay of the land relative to competition versus partnering and developing over time, if I could just walk through some of the products. From a PAC-3 standpoint, we do partner with Raytheon on the Patriot system. So we continue to sell PAC-3s around the world. And we just declared our initial operating capability for the PAC-3 MSE, the Missile Segment Enhancement, which is the extended range and greater capabilities. So we're going to have continued demand for the PAC-3 MSE. I think we'll see countries that will look at buying that greater capability. On THAAD, it's in the UAE today, of course. And there's a strong pull for THAAD in the Middle East. Qatar and potentially Saudi and others will be looking at THAAD going forward. On Aegis, we just with Korea and Japan, they're adding it to their ships, and we'll have other countries I think moving along in that regard. Aegis Ashore, we've set up our Aegis Ashore in Romania, and we see an opportunity in Poland. And then from a competition standpoint, MEADS, the Medium Extended Air Defense System, now that Germany has made their selection, we expect other NATO countries to be looking at MEADS and maybe some Middle East countries looking at MEADS as a potential for their capability with its 360-degree capability, and really the next generation beyond the Patriot system is a new system. So Poland is still looking at MEADS, for example, and we've had some interest from some Middle East countries on MEADS. And then the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent is another opportunity for us on growth in missile defense in the U.S. And so not just in the international marketplace, we continue to see growth in the domestic market for our missile defense capabilities. So hopefully that answers your question. I think over time, the defensive systems that countries need we expect they'll continue to put in place. But the rest are not diminishing, they're increasing. And so the defensive systems that we can provide or what we hear from countries around the world that they want, whether it's Japan or Saudi Arabia or the UAE or others, as I travel around the world, that is a top priority for these countries.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thank you, Pete.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: I had a couple program questions. One is the F-16. It looked like maybe you guys got approval during the quarter for an incremental order. I thought maybe it was Bahrain. Is that not part of the current planning? I was just curious of your thoughts on that, and then also when you expect the Qatar THAAD order to actually be booked.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: I'll try that, Pete. So I think the Bahrain order, there's now at least consideration from a government-to-government discussion about the opportunity to make that an order. It's not finalized by any stretch of imagination. And none of the numbers that I talked about previously in terms of the growth going forward assume the Bahraini aircraft in the F-16 line. So right now it's not in there. Longer term for the F-16 firm-up, as I had teed up to Noah's question, I think it was relative to the growth going forward. Right now, the F-16 line comes to an end in the middle of 2018 or thereabouts. If we were to get the Bahrain order, that would extend it probably another year or so. But you should think that the F-16 program has not gone away at all. In fact, if we look at 2017, I said 2018, I think the line comes to an end in 2017 – excuse me, I spoke a year off there. I think we have six aircraft deliveries in 2017. That's the wrap-up of the program from a build cycle versus 12 this year. and yet the sales on the F-16 program are higher next year than they are this yea. And in part that's because we have you should think of as three large international upgrade programs going on concurrently or pretty much concurrently. We've got the Singaporean, the Taiwanese, and a soon to be South Korean upgrade of their existing F-16 aircraft, which is actually as it turns out more than offsetting the production quantity aircraft drop-off next year, so hopefully a little more color there. THAAD Qatar, we had hoped to close that this year, looking towards the end of this calendar year. That's in all likelihood not going to happen. We have it planned and expect to close that in 2017.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning, Sam.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more just about Sikorsky. The purchase accounting changes, does that affect anything on a go-forward basis in terms of the GAAP earnings or loss on a run rate, and if you can at all size the favorable adjustment that you called out in the third quarter? And somewhat related is another helicopter manufacturer talked about seeing a bottoming on the commercial side of the business. I'm wondering if you've seen anything similar or what you're thinking about the commercial helicopter business now.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: So let's see. On the purchase accounting, Sam, I'd say that's a little bit of just housekeeping stuff, nothing hugely dramatic that occurred there, as some of these sorts of adjustments for things like inventory and so forth moved around a little bit, in part because of the timing of some of the deliveries associated with that inventory and just a better understanding of the business in total. All of the adjustments are required to be done one year after the purchase date, which I believe is November 6, so all those are required to be finalized in the fourth quarter. The one benefit that you should see going forward is we are going to have a lightening up, if you will, of the total conforming accounting and purchase accounting adjustments on Sikorsky. I'm thinking about $150 million a year or so going forward. So from 2016 to 2017, that was what was always in the plan. The purchase accounting adjustments that we see happening this year really don't impact that much. You just talked about opportunities relative to the bottoming out in the commercial marketplace and so forth. We're seeing opportunities pop up. I think Marillyn hit these pretty well in terms of the Polish BLACK HAWK deal, which would be actually built and delivered out of Poland from our facility there, is an interesting opportunity. We have other international opportunities, although they're coming in dribs and drabs, not huge orders, but they're still helping to fill the backlog. As far as the commercial helo market, we don't expect to see that change. In fact, our projections and what we gave on the 7% increase next year essentially says we're flat to maybe a few less than in 2016. And we're hopeful and the numbers would plan and suggest that there's a slight uptick in 2018, but nothing huge. So we think this is a fairly slow recovery and not a spike by any stretch of imagination, but nothing between 2016 and 2017.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Primarily on the oil and gas helicopters in that regard. We are looking for other opportunities for commercial helicopters, search and rescue, paramilitary, and things of that nature. But as Bruce said, the bulk of commercial helicopter sales in the past have been in the oil and gas, and so we look for recovery further out.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: Thank you, two things. One is I've got to give Jerry a shout-out. I don't know whether you're going to be on the next call or not, but I think that's important.
Greg M. Gardner - Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Service, Inc.: It depends on how he does on this call, Jerry. It depends on how he does this call, Howard.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: Or it depends on whether he likes – whether Marillyn likes my question or not, you know. But in all seriousness, in the past you've done a nice job of usually having risk reduction items that work in your favor. And if I tallied the numbers this quarter, outside of missiles and space, most of them went against you to the tune of around $150 million. Is there anything there that you can point to that's systematic, or is it just one-off items?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Howard, I'll take that one on. As we look at the third quarter adjustments, there were ins and outs across the business area, but it's actually very close to where we were at the third quarter of last year. Second quarter was quite a bit lighter. I think that's just the sequencing of milestone events. That's the sequencing of performance improvements, and they're just by their nature lumpy. But I don't think – I think you asked a question is it systemic or not. I don't think there's anything systemic, and that's not what's driving the marketplace going forward. As we're going to end the year, next quarter and for this year in 2016, at least as we sit here today, it looks pretty similar to what we did from planned step-ups in the fourth quarter versus 2013. We may end the year a little bit light, just relative to historical level, so probably in the lower 30%. I think last year we did 34-ish or thereabout percent. But we could have some improvement in the fourth quarter as well. So we'll tell you where we actually ended up at the end of the call in January. But I don't think, back to your original question, there was anything systemic there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much. Bruce, I think you mentioned either last call or the one before that that this year would be the bottom for Aeronautics margins and you start to get some improvement next year. I'm wondering if that's still your view. And then given the moving pieces in 2018 with F-16 and C-5 coming down, do Aero margins come back down, or is that level in 2017 something you can grow off of?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: So let me try to address that, Joe. I actually, obviously I did say that. You've got a good memory. I think the wildcard here is when I said that, I didn't expect to have the significant amount of growth on the F-35 program, particularly the sustainment piece of the F-35 program going from 2016 to 2017. It's just amazing the growth that we are seeing on the sustainment program compared to what we previously thought or at least what I previously thought and what I was basing that margin comment on. So the margin at Aero will likely be a little bit lighter in 2017 than it was in 2016. And most of that but maybe not all that is driven by the F-35 significant ramp up at again, what I always call the margin dilutive algebraic effect of just a lower margin program growing faster than the rest of the business area, and that has a dilutive effect on the margins. But as we look forward into 2018, and I did tee up the C-5 and the F-16, again, F-16 is not changing total sales volume all that much, although the aircraft quantities are coming down. C-5 is actually again a little bit dilutive to the overall margin. But because of the F-35 growth, it's occurring again between 2018 and 2017. I think the margins stay fairly constant probably as we look at this time for 2017 and 2018.
Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Andrea, this is Jerry. I know we're coming up on the hour. But because our comments were long today, I want people in the queue to not think they have to turn off here in the next two minutes. I think we have the ability to go another 15 minutes. So if we could, just extend it a little bit.
Operator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Bruce, I wanted to pursue the F-35 a little bit more. Deliveries this quarter were less than last year's quarter, and actually year to date I think you're one behind. I was thinking, if you could, just comment on what that is causing that and what it will be in the fourth quarter. And on that score, if I just look at your guidance, it implies over $5 billion of revenues in Aeronautics in the fourth quarter, which is usually a strong quarter, but the step up is much more than what we've seen in the past. So if you could discuss that. And then last, if I look at the $300 million of higher F-35 sales you called out, profit only up $25 million, so an 8.3% implied margin. That's a little lower than what we've seen in the past, so maybe you could comment on that. Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: George, you got your money's worth there, good job. So F-35 deliveries, and I should remind you, this is a POC cost-to-cost contract, so the revenue is not impacted by deliveries. But you did make the right observation, George. The deliveries were light, lighter than the third quarter than we'd otherwise suggest. And this is primarily because, and I know you guys have read about this, but we have these insulation tubes that affected a number of our aircraft in the field as well as the aircraft being produced. And while we have the fix for that issue in place, think of this as a supplier-driven item that we had an out-of-spec delivery that was installed in the aircraft. And as we go through and fix those for the aircraft in the field, we're also going back and fixing the aircraft that are effective with those lines in production, and that is going to cause us to end up a little lighter in F-35 deliveries this year than what we previously had said. We think we know the solution for that, as I said, and we think we recover such that by the end of 2017, we're back on contractual schedule and hopefully sooner than the end of 2017. But that's the expectation right now. The other thing you talked about was the F-35 being greater than $5 billion in the quarter or Aeronautics being greater than $5 billion in the quarter. That will be the highest quarter I think in the history of Aeronautics. But that's tracking, George, to what we expect the annual run rate to look like in 2017. Years ago, we had talked about the Aeronautics business area being about a $20 billion per year revenue business in 2015. It turns out we were close, but that's likely going to happen now in 2017 as opposed to 2015. So that's tracking right with our expectations. And then the last question on the $300 million in sales and the risk retirements and I think you said eight-point-something percent profit, that's in line with what we've done. We've had quarters previous to this year that were higher, but that's because we had some of the risk retirements that we were talking to Howard about earlier that occurred in previous quarters. When we have those risk retirements, we get a spike in the margin. We just didn't have as many this quarter, so the run rates you're seeing there is about the run rate without risk retirements in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi there.
Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hi, Rob.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good morning.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Bruce, I wanted to go back to Rich's question on the three-year goal back on slide 14. But if I understand it correctly, you're going into these next three years with the same cash flow goal, maybe a little higher, despite a $3 billion to $4 billion headwind from pension contributions, if we take 2018 and 2019 and add that together, if I heard that right. And so you talked about F-35 and Sikorsky providing some revenue and earnings growth as an offset. How much more is coming from CAS reimbursement? In other words, when we think about this, what is the underlying revenue increase, and how do the margins trend with that revenue?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: So first comment, Rob, is you did hear it right. That is what we said, and I think you got the math to all that correct. And honestly, that's an interesting question because actually the CAS recovery or the pension recovery associated with CAS is diminishing going forward. So again, we talked about 2015 to 2017 having a pension holiday. That means we're not going to make pension contributions, so a significant level of pension recovery because of that. Going forward, this is what I was trying to convey in my remarks. While we have pension contributions at the level that you just described, the CAS recovery is also increasing pretty significantly and stays fairly high throughout this entire timeframe. And that's again essentially – not essentially, but a good chunk of that is recovering that $7 billion of prefund credit that we have at the end of this year. So that has to come back at some point in the CAS billings that we had with the government. That's what sustains us over that time. Even though the net cash for pension is coming down, the offset is due to operational cash going up.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks, good afternoon now.
Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hi, David.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Bruce, to follow up on that question and then another question, the CAS recovery, which I think in 2016 is $2 billion, I think you've said $2.3 billion in 2017 previously, what does that grow to out in by 2019? And then my other question on Sikorsky performing better than I think your initial guidance for this year, I think you talked about intangibles coming down next year. I thought it was more around integration costs coming down. But if you could, just give us an idea of what operating profit out of Sikorsky or margins might look out of Sikorsky on an all-in basis next year. Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thank you, David. So on the CAS side, you've got the numbers right for both 2016 and 2017. And rather than give you a precise for 2018 and 2019, I would just say that CAS increases in 2018 over 2017, and it increases again in 2019 over 2018. You should think of those as several hundred millions of dollars levels between each year there. And that's again, back to Rob's question, that's one thing that's driving the cash recovery over that period of time. Sikorsky is doing better than we had expected, at least through the first three quarters of this year. I think we started off with probably a little more conservative view of Sikorsky, just a little bit of not knowing the business as well as I think we do now. And so we've seen some performance improvements or some risk retirements, I should say, in the third quarter that translate into better performance than we were seeing in the first two quarters of the year. I think you also talked about the changes in intangible, and I might have misspoken. I think I was talking about conforming accounting and intangible amortization all rolled up into one, and there are definitely some reductions in some of the conforming accounting adjustments. As well as I think one of things that I've teed up in the January call is there was about $30 million or $40 million of severance costs left over in 2016 from a severance action that was taken in the middle of 2015 that does not repeat itself in 2017. That along with lower integration costs in 2017 compared to 2016 is what's driving the improvements that I talked about.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hello, good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good afternoon.
Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: On F-35, I wanted to go back to what you said before about performance being ahead of your expectations, and particularly around sustainment. I'm curious as to, first, why was it is surprise that sustainment was larger than you thought? And then second, when you look forward, how does this larger amount of sustainment work? How do you see that going forward? Does that change the way that you look at the margin trajectory for the F-35 over the next few years?
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Good questions, Doug. I'll take that one on. So the performance – you described it as performance, I would not necessarily characterize it as performance. It's just the growth in sustainment activity that we see. And why the surprise or why did it seem like a surprise, I think to a certain extent, this was a little bit – I won't say out of our control entirely, but it is dependent upon when the government establishes the base setups for the induction of F-35 aircraft and what level of support those bases need in order to be ready to take on operational F-35 aircraft. And I'll say we were probably a little conservative or maybe a lot conservative in our forecast as far as thinking that the level of – if you just think of all the things that have to be at a base day one when you start delivering the aircraft to that base and all of the alternate mission equipment, all the support equipment and things to pull aircraft around, ladders to get on the aircraft, you can just imagine all the stuff that has to go into a base. And I'll say we were probably pretty light on that forecast until we had some of those bases under our belt. And now we have some of those bases under our belt and we have a better understanding of what the average needs are of the aircraft going forward. And so that's what we're projecting going forward. And I think we've got a much better handle on that going forward than we've had in the past. That's all good news as far as I'm concerned. Looking forward, you asked about the margin trajectory. I wouldn't expect to see huge swings in margin associated with sustainment. We typically get margins on sustainment, and they're negotiated concurrently with the aircraft burden. They're negotiated at about similar levels of profitability. So I wouldn't expect to see a swing either way because of production or sustainment. I might remind you that over time, the development program, the SDD contract is winding down over time. And again that will end eventually unless we continue to put development efforts on there, but that's going down next year. That's one of the things that's helping to mitigate some of the Aeronautics ROS dilution from the F-35 program.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. And I'd also like to extend a thanks to Jerry should you choose to ride off into the Florida sunshine before next quarter. You've been a real force for our world, so thanks a lot.
Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thank you.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Look, just a couple of clarifications in the interest of time. One, Bruce, the pension contribution of 1.5% to 2% you mentioned for 2018 and 2019, correct me if I'm wrong. I thought that used to be 1.5%. If that changed, I wondered if you could just tell us what drove that. And the second one is on the profit delta on the C-130 that you called out in the release. It looks like that's 1,200 basis points lower. How much of that should we think is difference in booking rate under the new contract versus adjustments unrelated to volume that are different year over year? Thanks a lot.
Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks, Carter, for the question. So I teed up the $1.5 billion I think a while back. I gave a range today, as you no doubt picked up, from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. You should think of that as just asset returns compounding and whether or not we're probably getting a little leeway there as far as we've assumed 8% returns going forward. We've assumed about a 5% return on assets in 2017. The underperformance of the 8% has a compounding effect that says you have to have higher CAS contributions going forward, and that's simplistically the reason for the range we're giving today is simply the asset returns. C-130, previous years we did have some pretty good size pickups or step-ups or risk retirements relative to the third quarter last year. But you're also seeing, as you described it, the lower booking rate on the newly negotiated multiyear contract that has an effect of having a lower profit rate than we've seen in the past years on the C-130 program.
Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Andrea, I think we're coming up on the extra end of the 15 minutes, maybe final comments here my Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.: Thanks, Jerry. As we conclude the call today, I'd like to end by reiterating that the corporation completed an excellent quarter, and we continue to build on our momentum. We have a robust backlog. And as we look at an increasing DOD budget, we're well positioned for top line growth and strong cash flows in the future. Before we leave the call today, I also want to take a moment to recognize that this is Jerry's last earnings call before he retires at the end of this year. Jerry, thank you for everything that you've done for me and for the corporation. You're truly the consummate IR professional and you will be missed, as you've heard from some of your colleagues on the phone today. And let me at this time also welcome Greg Gardner, who is Jerry's successor. Most of you have known Greg for several years. Jerry and Greg will work over the next few months to ensure that there's a smooth transition. So again, thank you for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you on the next earnings call in January, when we will review our 2016 full-year results and provide our formal 2017 guidance. Andrea, that concludes the call for today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to have you with us as we review second quarter results and our increased financial outlook for 2016. As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter operationally and financially. The corporation continued to track towards another year of strong financial results, while returning value to stockholders and delivering critical solutions to customers. I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including the status of the strategic transaction in which our Information Systems & Global Solutions business will be separated from Lockheed Martin and combined with Leidos. And I'll share some noteworthy operational achievements in our business areas. Turning to the summary financials, our team continue to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, the second quarter numbers exceeding all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full-year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations. As a reminder the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full-year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business. If the divestiture of IS&GS is completed in the third quarter as currently anticipated, we will revise our 2016 financial outlook during our call with you in October. Switching to IS&GS and the status of its combination with Leidos, significant progress towards transaction closure continues to be achieved. We commenced our exchange offer on Monday of last week. Also last week, the Competition and Markets Authority in the United Kingdom concluded its review, satisfying another condition to closing. As we outlined on our press release last week, announcing the start of the exchange period, the offer provides Lockheed Martin stockholders the opportunity to exchange their shares of Lockheed Martin for shares of stock in a Lockheed Martin subsidiary, which then become shares of Leidos common stock upon completion of the transaction. As you are aware, the combination of IS&GS with Leidos is structured as a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We will then retire the series of Lockheed Martin stock exchanged, achieving a significant reduction in our outstanding share count. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and closing is currently scheduled for August 16. Switching to operational highlights, I'll start with some key accomplishments and events on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Overall the program continued to achieve good progress across the multiple fronts of winding down development activities, ramping up production rate and sustainment activities and securing customer support and demand. On the development program, key events this quarter included surpassing 60,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations and maturity of the aircraft. We are also achieving increased stability in the software on the aircraft and in the ground support equipment. We continue to make strides in software development on the aircraft and in the Autonomic Logistics Information System, known as ALIS, that is used to maintain the F-35 planes. Evidence of this progress was demonstrated last month at Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho, where F-35 fighters were deployed to a remote site to test aircraft performance and mission availability, using the latest version of the maturing software. During this deployment, the aircraft successfully cleared 88 of 88 sorties, while also achieving 100% on-time performance of the sorties. Additionally, the aircraft achieved zero avionic shutdowns on the ground or in flight due to any software stability issues. The deployment met all of the customer's tactical objectives and proved that the aircraft can successfully operate at remote locations away from its home base. These successful series of tests are key milestones in preparation of the F-35 CTOL fleet to achieve initial operational capability for the U.S. Air Force later this year. During the deployment test at the Mountain Home base, the F-35 had the opportunity to engage with frontline legacy aircraft and performed exceptionally well in mock combat engagements. The tremendous technological leap in capabilities that the F-35 provides are being demonstrated on a daily basis to a growing number of domestic and international customers as the aircraft is fielded at additional sites. With the future price of an F-35 estimated to approach the price of a legacy fighter, the unmatched capability of fifth-generation stealth provided by the Joint Strike Fighter becomes even more compelling to customers as they recapitalize their fighter fleets. Looking at the production activity on the program, progress continues to be made in ramping up the rate of production and reducing the cost of the aircraft. On production, we are on track to increase our deliveries to 53 aircraft this year and have delivered approximately 180 aircraft since program inception. In the area of cost reductions, we continue to make significant progress on our previously announced blueprint for affordability, shared commitment between the government and industry. To build upon that success, we announced two additional cost reduction initiatives last week at Farnborough. The first action is a two-year extension of our cost savings investment that is designed to achieve lifecycle savings of more than $4 billion over the remaining production run of aircraft. Additionally, we also announced an initiative over the next couple of years to reduce sustainment costs by 10%. This action is expected to achieve $1 billion in savings for the five-year period, and includes projects such as spare parts block buys and establishing ALIS regional sustainment centers. Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35, key milestones this past quarter on the domestic side include revalidation to Congress by the Department of Defense of the critical and unchanged procurement requirement to replace legacy aircraft with 2,443 JSF fighters for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. Internationally, support remains strong and growing with key events that included selection of the F-35 by the Danish Parliament as their next generation fighter with a procurement of 27 aircraft; rollout of the first F-35A for Israel at our Fort Worth facility and the arrival of the first two F-35A fighters into the Netherlands. I was able to see firsthand the growing international interest and support of the F-35 earlier this month, when I had the opportunity to attend both the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough air shows in the United Kingdom. Customers and attendees were able to see up close the revolutionary capabilities of both CTOL and STOVL F-35 aircraft at the air shows as they performed their aerial maneuvers. This marked the debut of the F-35 at major international air shows, demonstrating the increasing maturity and progress on the program. We are honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies, as we collectively field this next generation fighter for decades to come. Turning to other areas in the corporation, a noteworthy accomplishment was achieved on our Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopter program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The test helicopters on the development program continued to progress through a series of increasing payload lift weights to validate capabilities. Recently, the aircraft successfully lifted a 27,000 pound external load, satisfying the contractual requirement for maximum lift weight. With more than triple the payload of the predecessor CH-53E, the new helicopter can accommodate a range of missions. The CH-53K can execute heavy lift missions more effectively and safely, in day and night and all weather conditions using its modern glass cockpit. To date, we have delivered three CH-53K helicopters on the development program that are enabling testing to move ahead and support the service's goal to achieve initial operational capability planned in 2019. Providing this enhanced capability is essential to our fighters and the Department of Defense program of record continues to project procurement of 200 CH-53K aircraft to replace aging legacy helicopters. The CH-53K is also generating growing interest from multiple countries, in addition to that in the United States and offers opportunities to expand production levels beyond the quantities required on the Marine Corps program. I will conclude my remarks by offering my congratulations to our Space Systems team for their flawless support of NASA's interplanetary mission to insert the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter. The Juno spacecraft was designed and constructed by our space personnel in Colorado and has been operated as a joint team with NASA. After launch in August 2011, the spacecraft traveled 1.8 billion miles to Jupiter, at speeds of up to 165,000 miles per hour for almost five years, before successfully settling into orbit on July 4. Juno will spend nearly two years orbiting the planet, while studying the structure, origin, atmosphere and magnetosphere of Jupiter for NASA. The successful orbit insertion mission exemplifies the unmatched capability of our corporation in making the impossible, possible for our customers. There were no second chances for this orbital insertion and our spacecraft and teammates performed flawlessly in achieving mission success. Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to offer my appreciation and thanks to our IS&GS team. Their dedication and continued focus on mission execution and our customers during this extended transitional phase have been superb. With the upcoming closure of the transaction with Leidos, I am certain that the IS&GS efforts have made the business even stronger and helped position the new enterprise to generate value for shareholders and opportunities for employees as they move forward. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail and then we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's start with chart three and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $12.9 billion, well ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.4 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.32 in the quarter and we'll discuss each of these metrics in the coming charts. We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter. And as with last quarter, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. All in all, we had a strong quarter and are well-positioned to the first half of the year to achieve our outlook. On chart four, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter versus the second quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.3 billion or 11% this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky in the results of MST for about $1.2 billion and nearly $250 million in growth at Aeronautics driven by $400 million higher F-35 volume which more than offset two fewer C-5 deliveries in the quarter compared to last year. Segment operating profit was $24 million higher than last year, with the growth coming from the volume at Aeronautics and significantly higher profit in IS&GS and Space Systems. These increases more than offset the effects of purchase accounting adjustments and transaction cost associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky as well as the expected reduction of margin at Missiles and Fire Control. On chart five, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.32, which represents about a 13% increase over the EPS in the second quarter of last year. This year benefited from strong operational performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment and a $0.04 benefit from the adoption of a new accounting standard as discussed in our earnings release. If you'll turn to chart six, we review our cash from operations in the quarter. Cash generated in the quarter was almost $1.5 billion, $200 million more than in the second quarter of last year. This is particularly noteworthy given that we expected to recover a significant amount of cash associated with the completion of negotiations on F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 by now. Strong cash generation in each of the other core business areas beyond Aeronautics, including a large international receipt by Sikorsky, helped to offset the F-35 shortfall. And while we expect to recover that shortfall soon, if additional funding is not received, the investment level will grow dramatically during the coming months. Turning to chart seven, you can see the significant amount of cash returned to our stockholders in the quarter. With just over $1 billion returned to stockholders evenly split between dividends and share repurchases, we returned over 80% of free cash flow in the quarter. Chart eight provides an update to our current outlook for the year. As a result of the strong performance in the quarter and prospects for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our sales outlook by $400 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million. We'll provide additional insight into these improvements in the next two charts. We also increased our outlook for earnings per share by $0.65, and we'll provide more detail into that increase in a few charts. And we're increasing our cash from operations outlook by $100 million. This obviously assumes that we receive additional at F-35 funding, as we've already discussed. And as a reminder, our guidance continues to assume the inclusion of full-year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business. Chart nine provides the updated sales outlook by business area. We increased our sales outlook by $400 million, $350 million in Aeronautics due primarily to higher than planned F-35 volume, and $50 million in Space Systems, reflecting the stronger start to the year than we anticipated. On chart ten, we show the changes to our segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our profit outlook by $125 million, with $60 million of that increase coming from IS&GS as a result of its strong first-half performance. Aeronautics increased by $40 million driven by the higher sales volume, and Space Systems increased by $25 million, reflecting its better than planned performance to date. Moving to chart 11, we have a reconciliation of our current earnings per share outlook compared with the first quarter. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit increases our outlook by $0.25. The newly adopted accounting standard for the treatment of equity-based compensation that we described in our earnings release increased 2016 EPS by $0.45. This change in accounting is reflected as if it had been in place from the beginning of the year. As a result, our year-to-date EPS includes a benefit of $0.37, $0.33 from the first quarter when the majority of our equity-based compensation vested. The remaining two quarters of the year are anticipated to receive similar benefits of $0.04 per quarter, totaling to the $0.45 increase for the year. A number of minor other changes in the quarter amounted to a $0.05 reduction to EPS, and combined, these changes increased our EPS outlook by $0.65 for the year. On chart 12, we have a reminder of several key financial impacts that we expect when the IS&GS Reverse Morris Trust transaction closes. We'll receive a special cash payment of $1.8 billion. At current trading prices, we would expect to reduce our common shares outstanding by about 10 million shares, though this is obviously subject to change as both Lockheed Martin and Leidos stock prices fluctuate during the exchange period. And we would expect to have a significant book gain when the deal closes. In addition to the deal closure in the third quarter, we expect to have a number of other significant events occur in the quarter as well. Chart 13 highlights these upcoming financial events. Obviously, the first significant event we are expecting is the IS&GS transaction closure. The year-to-date results of IS&GS through closure will be moved to discontinued operations, as will the book gain that we discussed on the prior chart. We also expect to have a net pension gain upon closure associated with the departure of IS&GS employees. This pension gain will be recorded in discontinued operations as well. Corporate cost allocated to IS&GS up to the date of closure will be moved from IS&GS' results and reflected as other unallocated cost in continuing operations. Importantly, there is no economic impact as a result of this cost reclassification, and we will be filing pro forma financials. Next, we expect to close on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts, and recover the significant operating cash tied to those negotiations. We also expect to increase our ownership and obtain control of a joint venture within Space Systems to manage the atomic weapons establishment in the UK. A book gain will be recognized in our operating results upon closure of the transaction. Going forward, we will fully consolidate AWE's financials and continue to report its operating results in our Space Systems segment. Then, we expect to finalize our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments next quarter. And lastly, we'll provide our trend information for 2017, including an updated discount rate projection and its impact on our expected FAS/CAS adjustment. So, you can see that we anticipate a number of moving pieces in the quarter, some of which are individually significant, but collectively will be quite significant. We'll provide updated guidance for all these events during our next earnings call in October. Finally, on chart 14, we have our summary. We had a strong quarter, and that led to increases in our outlook. The IS&GS exchange offer has begun, which places us on the path to close the transaction in the middle of August, and we remain focused on providing outstanding products and services to our customers, and strong returns to our stockholders. With that, we're ready for your questions. Kat?
Operator: Thank you. In the interest of time, we are limiting you to one question. Please return to the queue for any follow-up questions. At this time, we're opening our lines for questions. Our first question comes from line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: I realize it's maybe a little bit early to ask this question, but can you help us think about the work statement that you have with Turkey as it relates to the F-35 in the context of maybe some of the sustainment? And if you want to talk about any sort of longer-term implications from some of the recent activities there as it relates to the F-35, that would be helpful. Thanks so much.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, I'll take that question and, Bruce, if you have anything you want to add, (22:30) do that. I think if you look at Turkey, I know there's been a lot of churn in Turkey here recently, but it still remains a very valued NATO partner for us, a NATO ally, and it's got – it's an essential security partner in that region for the United States and for our allies. So we look forward to continue our business relationship there and across the number of programs that we have. We have not seen any indication that it will impact the F-35 or any of their other programs. And so, we'll continue to assess the situation and make sure that we'll share with you if there's any impact on our business. Their plan is to procure 100 F-35s, so they're a very important partner in that program. Bruce, anything you want to add?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. The only thing I would add, Hunter, is we've got a long, long history with Turkey. We've worked with them since the pretty early days of the F-16 program. We've actually built F-16s in Turkey. As you know and the heart of your question, we're also doing parts of the F-35 at TUSAS Aerospace Industries in Turkey. That relationship has been successful. As you said, it's probably early to call what the grand implications are, but they've been, as Marillyn said, a trusted partner with Lockheed Martin for quite some time, and we hope that's the case in the future, obviously.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning. Thank you, Pete.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: The F-35, the LRIP 9, 10 contract, you talked about the investment level growing dramatically in the coming months if it doesn't get signed, I think. Can you size that for us? And what's your sense of how close you are to the contract getting signed and are you definitely going to cash fund it if it doesn't close?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, let me give you just a little bit of color. It's a good question, Pete. And so, the current level, I think we disclosed in the earnings release. We've got nearly $1 billion or so that we're funding on the program, and that's a decision that we made to do that for whatever reason the U.S. Government has not decided to put funds that are authorized and appropriated to fund Lockheed Martin and our subcontractor efforts on the contracts. So, we've been – we made the decision at the time that we were going to not allow a stop on the program and cause a disruption on the program, particularly in our supply base that's – since that's where most of the work is being done at this time on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts. So, we've been funding that for a while. We continue to ask for funding recovery from the U.S. Government. To this point, they have not funded us. At some point in the future, because of the growth that we see over the next few months, and you should think of this literally growing, Pete, in the $400 million to $500 million per month sorts of levels, we will not be able to sustain that. So that if we don't either get funding through a funding mechanism such as a Yucca (25:46) funding item or we definitize the contracts, we will not be able to continue and have that level of cash outflow as a corporation, we simply don't have that capacity. The Pentagon clearly knows that situation, and I'm optimistic that we're going to get cash soon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Marillyn, Bruce, Jerry, good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Jerry F. Kircher - Vice President-Investor Relations: Hi, Rich.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I know I usually ask the question about programs, but today, I have one on pension income and cash funding requirements. Now, if you would – relative to where rates were in – are in – were in 2015, I want to know if you could maybe discuss what you expect for 2017 for FAS/CAS income. Also, can you give us maybe your best estimate regarding whether or not you're going to have a cash contribution to pension next year? If so, how much? Maybe you could give us a range on that. Anything you could give would be helpful.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I'll take that one, Rich. Thanks for the question. So, we're probably a little early to be talking about 2017. I think it feels a little early to be talking about 2017, but I think it's a fair question given all the changes that have happened in the interest rate environment here recently, particularly after the Brexit situation. And I think what our 10-year treasury is going for, 1.4% or thereabouts, so dramatic reduction from the start of the year to now. I think we ended the year at a discount rate of about 4 3/8% or 4.375%. If we were to strike a line on the sand right now, it's probably 100 basis points lower than that. You tell me whether you think it's going to increase between now and the end of the year or not, but if it did not, every 25 basis points change in the discount rate from where we ended last year is worth about $125 million delta to FAS expense. So that's a pretty significant reduction in the FAS next year. Our asset returns, you didn't ask about those, but that's the other component in the mix. The asset returns are actually tracking pretty nicely towards an 8% return. We've had a nice lift in the equity markets, particularly domestically here recently that it helped with that situation. So, if I were to predict, again, kind of striking the line in the sand, our current FAS/CAS in 2016 is roughly, what, $975 million or so of income. Looking forward and just carrying those impacts into 2017 that I just described, 2017 would probably be $350 million, maybe $400 million lower than 2016 still income from FAS/CAS, if you will, but not as much income as what we've been expecting and talking about previously. As to your cash funding question, there is no impact next year at all associated with the discount rate change. I mean, ERISA is far more – ERISA, which requires the funding levels for our pension trust, is far more sensitive to asset returns than the discount rate changes. FAS is sort of a instantaneous discount rate impact, where as ERISA is spread over time. So we wouldn't expect any change whatsoever in the funding requirements in 2017, still zero.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.
Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Bruce, I think you talked the last quarter about 2018 pension contributions. And apologies for asking a question that's so far out in the future, but you said that you think you can fill most or if not, all of that gap. I'm wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail about – of the $1.5 billion in contribution, what's the cash tax benefit and then what are some of the other areas you see as helping you guys fill that gap?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Thanks, Joe. So I actually plan to give a little more insight into the 2018 numbers probably in the October call, but let me take a shot at it now just because you asked the question. So, we have said that 2017, we talked about being the last of the three-year, what we call pension funding holiday that we announced, I guess, at the beginning of 2015. As Rich asked in his question about cash funding, we don't see that changing in 2017. In the previous quarters, I did talk about 2018 having a required pension contribution, and obviously, that's still the case. However, what I was trying to convey – and the number you threw out, about $1.5 billion, it's floating around there maybe a little bit higher now. But what I was trying to convey on previous calls and what I'll try to convey on this call is you shouldn't think of sort of the current level of operating cash dropping by the full amount of pension funding in 2018, and that's really for a couple of reasons. One is we expect to get much stronger cash flows from Sikorsky in 2018 versus what we're seeing today. We expect to have higher cash flow from F-35 than we're seeing today. And then lastly, as you described in your question, we also – we'll get a tax benefit associated with the pension cash contribution in 2018. So think of that as sort of 65% simplistically of the cash contribution is what will be a hit to operating cash in that year, if you will.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Sam.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more philosophically just about capital allocation and share buyback. And I know you have a target of 300 million shares – or less than 300 million shares outstanding, but just trying to think about where the stocks multiple is now and just trying to think about how you factor that into what you do with your capital and whether that makes other alternatives more attractive than repurchasing shares.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Let me take a shot at that, Sam. So, it's a great question as far as capital allocation plans. We still feel strongly about the dividend, capital allocations that we provided to shareholders. We have – if you just look at the composition of our shareholder base, it's probably, I don't remember if 30%, 35%. I'm looking at Jerry, I say it is 30%, 35% of our investor base is sort of income base. So, that's a pretty significant element of our ownership that is driven, in fact, by the dividend yield. So, that's an important aspect of capital allocation going forward. I always say that I think the best indication of what we'll do there is sort of the track record we've had in the last few years or even a decade or more relative to dividend contributions. We still have some options that have yet to be exercised. The option exercise has actually slowed down quite a bit. If I remember, Sam, you've been following us long enough years ago, we had a lot of dilution as a result of options being exercised, that level has come down quite a bit, but there's still a backlog of options out there that as those do get exercised, we will clearly do share repurchases to offset that dilution. We will do share repurchases to offset dilution from the equity compensation as well. And then from that point, Sam, as usual, and this probably will not be the most satisfying answer you'll get, but as usual, it sort of depends on what's available in terms of capital allocation at that time, including other opportunities to invest in programs, acquisitions, that sort of thing. The one thing that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense at least at this point is to let it just sit sort of idly on the balance sheet, making as little interest as, in fact, it does. I'll remind you, and I know you know this, Sam, but the RMT transaction will reduce share count pretty significantly on its own, probably somewhere between 9 million shares and 10 million shares at sort of current trading. And on top of that, we get the $1.8 billion special payment, as I talked about. And lacking a more pressing or – what's the word I'm looking for...
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Opportunistic.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Opportunistic. That's good work, Marillyn. Opportunistic use of that $1.8 billion, I would think a good chunk of that would probably go towards share repurchases.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'm interested, Bruce said when – and you clearly had a very good quarter, and you said that it was a surprise to you all, I think, that the sales and your profitability were up as high as they were. Could you talk a little bit about that? Because if I look forward for the rest of the year, are these – is the surprise you had something that suggests your ongoing performance may actually be better perhaps than you've been expecting? And the guidance change doesn't really suggest that. So I'm just wondering what you took away from the quarter and what that means for the longer term.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, it's a good question, Doug. Look, I'm very happy with the first half of the year. And I don't know that if (36:08) that, but I used the word surprise, I'll say we were pleasantly higher than expected or higher than planned for a couple of items, including, for instance, the ULA equity earnings that we got in the quarter. Some of this was sort of fortuitous in terms of the mix of launch vehicles, also the pricing of the launch vehicles that we had in the quarter for ULA. So, for instance, we had an Atlas or – excuse me, a Delta Heavy launch, which is the most expensive launch vehicle that ULA produces, went off in the second quarter, that helped the earnings in the second quarter. Things like that, again, for the first half of the year, all helped us. You were quizzing a little bit about while that didn't necessarily translate into the full-year, I'll say we kind of gave the first half performance and the outlook for the year, and we definitely have the opportunities that I think you're alluding to, Doug, in the second half of the year, but we have to make those happen. And sometimes things don't work out as planned, and that's probably the reason that we provided the guidance that we did. But nothing taken away from – we feel very, very good and pleased with the first half performance of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the – with a little more specificity on Aeronautics. I'm curious why the second half EBIT implied in the guidance is flat to maybe even down a touch versus the first half on higher volume, and then I think you're also recovering the restructuring expenses you had in the first quarter. So is there mix, is there something else maybe, Bruce, that you can help us explain why Aeronautics isn't going to outperform that guidance?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Good question, Myles. So, look, I kind of answered the question from Doug. I'd like to think that we have sort of, as I said in previous calls, the same sort of opportunities. If I have a good second half as we have in the first half, the one probably most notable change from first half to second half is the fact that we had some F-35 production step-ups in the first half of the year, particularly on sort of the winding down of LRIP 7 aircraft deliveries and a little bit of step-up on LRIP 8, excuse me, as we go into a higher ramp rate there. We don't currently have plans for F-35 production step-ups for the rest – or for the second half of the year, and so that's one of the things that will cause the second half of the year to look a little wider probably than the first half of the year. And then secondly, the volume level of F-35, as I alluded to, and the reason for the change in our guidance for the year is really significant – is really expected to be higher in the second half, and that has that dilutive effect on the overall margins of Aeronautics that I talked about in the past. So, those two reasons probably both netted to F-35, one was the step-ups that occurred in the first-half; and secondly, excuse me, is just the volume in the second-half.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much. Marillyn, you put one of your top managers at Sikorsky to run the business. Could you give us sort of a six-month read on where you are and how it's going? I mean, it looks to me like it's a little more expensive out of the box than one would have first thought.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, you're right about putting one of our top folks there. We have Dan Schultz who run large business areas for businesses for us in the past and also is a helicopter pilot out of the Marine Corps, so he knows the business extremely well and he's doing a great job there. I'll tell you, I'm really excited about a couple of things, Howard, that we've seen in the past six months. First off, we're tracking to what we had planned. I mean, well, from your perspective, maybe different, but frankly, we're right on plan with what we track. But what I'm excited about is some of the revenue synergies that we see just by getting the integration process well underway and getting our teams together. For example, we were – I was at the Farnborough Airshow, as I mentioned earlier, and we showcased an armed BLACK HAWK helicopter that's taking weapons systems and sensors and things from our Missiles and Fire Control business, combining it with the platform that's in Mission Systems and Training, Sikorsky business, and showcasing that on – at our satellite area in Farnborough. And we had tremendous amount of interest in it. A lot of customers are now following up with us on – and interest there, so that's just one example. We've got many other examples where our teams are getting together and we see a chance to do just what we thought when we purchased Sikorsky, and that is to not only get the cost synergies of bringing that element into our business, but also – but more importantly, to get the revenue synergies and get the growth moving forward on it. So, we're on track, we've talked before in this call about our commercial element Sikorsky and the oil and gas price pressures on that business, but we've been very frank about where we stand on that, and based on what our outlook was and what we set for the year, we're right on track with that as well.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Marillyn – or, Howard, just to add maybe a little bit to what Marillyn said relative to the armed BLACK HAWK, only because I think it's an interesting little tidbit there. So you should think of this as essentially taking a utility helicopter platform and essentially transitioning it into an attack platform. The interesting thing from the way the design was conceived and the way it will be sold internationally, especially, is you can remove that capability. So within a day's time or so, the weapons packages and so forth that are put on to make this an armed platform can be removed from the helicopter, and the next day, you can go out and perform a mission of a utility helicopter. That's some flexibility that doesn't exist right now in the marketplace. And that's something that we think is very interesting that, frankly, would not have happened, but for the synergy between our Missiles and Fire Control organization, the – our MST organization and obviously, Sikorsky now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just maybe a quick update post Farnborough on what's going on with the trainer program and the timeline for that, and how you expect it to go.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, on the T-X program you're referring to, I'm presuming, for the U.S. Air Force...
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: (43:19) Yeah, yeah.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Thank you. I guess where that stands right now is we're standing by with what we consider to be a very good offering. It's an excellent solution, it's low risk, it's – we've got it – it's the T-50A when our joint venture with Korean Aerospace, it's flying right now. We've already had our first flight of our offerings, so we've taken that T-50 with KAI and converted it into T-50A to meet the requirements that the Air Force has outlined, and we're excited about the fact that we've flown it, we're demonstrating it, and we think we have an excellent offering. Now the RFP appears to be slipping out, it's slipping out into the December timeframe. So, we'll – I think that what I understand is that the Air Force wants to revisit what they've outlined as the requirements for that capability, and they will slip the RFP out some, and we stand ready to support that. But in the meantime, we are continuing to roll out our capabilities and showcase that capability. It's a big program, it's about 350 aircraft, so it's an opportunity for us. In our case, there is some discussion around whether or not the Air Force wants to pursue a clean sheet design or an existing design. We believe that with the tremendous gap on the training capabilities, the T-38 is – I don't think it's close to 50 years old or something like that, it's – they need to replace that aircraft. And the fact that we have a low risk aircraft that's already flying that can meet today's requirements, we think we're offering something that would allow the U.S. Air Force to move forward on the program and meet that capability. There are other offerings out there as well that are not clean-sheet. And so, we like to compete and we think we have a tremendous offering.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC: Yes, Bruce, a couple of quick things. Previously you had said that with the Leidos transaction that you would buy sufficient stock to offset the dilution. Given where the stocks are now, you'd probably have to use all of the $1.8 billion and maybe even to touch more to offset the dilution, so is that still the intent? And then second, you took about a $30 million charge, it looks like on the international contract that you alluded to in the Q1 document, and I was just wondering if you think that's the end of it? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Thank you, George. So, relative to the share count reduction and whether or not that's enough to sort of offset the dilution effects of losing the IS&GS earnings or not, you're right. At the call when we announced the deal back in January, we said that the share buyback was essentially going to be enough to make that sort of neutral between the two years. Since that time, our stock has increased. If I look at it today, it's up almost 25% over what the number was in January. I think we were trading at around $210 a share the day we announced the deal. So, pretty significant increase on our side, which makes it obviously more expensive to buy back the same number of shares as we'd expected in the January call. On the other hand, the Leidos stock price has dropped a little bit since that time, so both of those are sort of working against us from a shares perspective, that will be taken out as a result of the RMT transaction. So, where we sit today, George, even with the $1.8 billion, it's probably difficult to get exactly to neutral, but it gets a lot closer there. We still think the economics of this deal relative to all options that we looked at, an outright sale, a pure spin, this is still the best situation for Lockheed Martin and its shareholders and we don't have regret on that. Notwithstanding the fact that to your point we actually may see a little bit of EPS dilution as a result of the stock price movement, I think that's a little bit of a high-class problem that we're experiencing right now, but nonetheless that is where we are. As to the charge we took, we did take an additional charge, $30 million. You're right. This is sort of the command and control business that we're looking, so think of this as sort of a system that controls all sorts of air missile defense capabilities around an entire country including identifying friend or foes, so that you don't have the wrong issues with the air missile defense capability, so linking into a lot of different systems. We think we have prospects once this system is developed in other places internationally, but we've had some growing pains obviously with this. And I think as we've gone through the development in early stages of this program, the customer has kind of changed some of what their expectations are, so we are in discussions with the customer right now about sort of closure of this contract. We think where it sits right now, it's pretty well-positioned in terms of the charges we've taken. There is some upside potential to that depending on where the customer wants to head. There could be some downside, so we're kind of in the middle of that right now, George, and obviously we'll keep you apprised as we go through future quarters and let you know how we're performing on that contract.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Rob.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Rob.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Just going back to the F-35, Bruce, you've talked about double-digit margins I think in 2019 and in context with the two new initiatives that Marillyn spoke about that were announced last week, I guess it's around $430 million in new cost and clearly both you and the government are trying to get the best deal done here on 9 and 10. Is that still the trajectory, and how have margins been tracking lately?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, Rob, that is still the objective and, just a slight correction maybe on what you said that the two initiatives, sort of the second part of the Blueprint for Affordability and the sustainment activity is more like about $420 million. I remind you, this is an investment....
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Naturally....just go ahead, I'm sorry.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I think your question, was that shared? And it is in fact shared between ourselves, Northrop Grumman and BAE, just as the first Blueprint for Affordability initiative was. It's hard to say, these are investments and you expect to get returns on your investments. We were getting a return on the Blueprint for Affordability one. We would expect to get returns on Blueprint for Affordability two as well as the sustainment investment that we're making. But notwithstanding that, I still think we're on a trajectory on the F-35 program. And I think I've said, more than having the specific year, it's relating more to when will we get full rate production that we hope to get to double-digit margins by that time. I've always said at similar points in time of the program's life cycle, it ought to look like an F-16 program or an F-22, or a C-130, there's sort of nothing structurally that would prevent us from getting to those levels. And right now, we're sort of tracking towards that trajectory, we've not come off of that at all.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, David.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Bruce, hate to do it, but going back on pension, I think previously you had said FAS/CAS for 2017, kind of all things staying the same discount rate hitting your assumed rate of return would be about a $450 million positive relative to 2016. So I want to clarify your answer on the prior pension question, where you talked about $350 million, are you talking about $350 million worth off of the projected 2017 level or off of the actual 2016 level? And then the other thing, the $1.8 billion that you're getting in conjunction with the closing on IS&GS, would you potentially look at that for an early pension contribution that potentially offset some of the downside? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, yeah. Thanks, David. And I probably wasn't at my clearest when I made that Fed reference in the first quarter. I think I heard feedback as we ran around in investor conferences and so forth, that I think I stumbled with my answer there quite honestly. So I tried to be clearer this time. Obviously, I'm still not being clear, but let me try to be as crystal-clear as I can on this thing. So FAS/CAS in 2016, the benefit is about $975 million or so. What I said is, I would expect to be between, if we struck the line in the sand right now, probably $350 million to $400 million lower than the 2016 FAS/CAS benefit in 2017. I mean, to do the math that kind of translates into $625 million, $600-ish million dollar income number down considerably from what we were talking about in the first quarter of last year. Almost all of that because of the discount rate change in the 1,000 basis – or not 1,000, 100 basis points as I talked about. Importantly, back to Rich's question, it's a non-cash item, will not affect our 2017 contributions at all. And that relates to your question relative to the $1.8 billion and we would use that to pre-fund the pension plan. The answer is, we don't have that expectation sitting here today and I don't think that's what we will do with the money. As I said earlier in the – to another question, I think the more likely outcome is probably share repurchases at this point in time and we'll fund the 2018 requirement in 2018. We've already got quite honestly a fairly sizable prepayment credit balance in terms of how much we have contributed to ERISA versus what we've collected from our government contracts and we don't see the point at this time of sort of increasing that level.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you very much. So in the quarter, you had a reasonable book-to-bill of 0.85 at IS&GS and yet my understanding is that that number excluded the FAA contract you got recently and the protested ISR award you had in the second quarter. As you – and yet, you also mentioned the Australian contract had another schedule delay. Can you update us, as you look at next year, what the IS&GS, any color on where the IS&GS numbers might be?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Cai, I think that's probably across – against an area where we're better suited to point you to the prospectus that we got for the RMT transaction rather than me comment on what IS&GS sales would look like under Lockheed Martin in 2017 when that's not our expectation.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning Marillyn and Bruce.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a question on the F-35, just to clarify and a second part, the sustainment initiative on reducing those costs. You said 10% reduction there or $1 billion in five years implies a – clearly a very large sustainment amount, a $10 billion amount. That seemed kind of large, I just wondered if you could clarify if that was correct? And then secondly, with respect to the contract action, if you end up getting a UCA on this, in the coming quarter or two quarters, Bruce, is there a particular cost or margin impact to one contract outcome versus another that you're considering in your guidance or in the plan? How should we think about that in terms of how that that gets finalized with the customer. Thanks.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: With the point to the question, Carter, let me just take the first one on the Blueprint...
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: ...for Affordability for sustainment. What we announced was an investment of up to $250 million over the next couple of years, much like we did on Blueprint for Affordability for production, this time for sustainment along with BAE and Northrop Grumman. And we're targeting over that five-year period that we would reduce sustainment cost by 10%. So, that's where the $1 billion dollar savings for that five-year period would come from. We've got a lot of projects that we've outlined and so it will be jointly with the U.S. government. They will approve those projects, we'll implement them and then as Bruce said earlier, we will get a return on our investment. I think that answers that question, unless there's something more there, Bruce, that you want to add.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Nothing to that. I'll try to address the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10. So, maybe a little bit more than you want, Carter, but – so yeah, there's sort of two ways that we could get cash recovery on this program. One is through what's called an undefinitized contractual action or UCA, you've heard that term obviously in the past. We don't care frankly how we get the cash. If it comes under a UCA though, UCAs get funded essentially and it allows you to bill against the UCA with progress payments. So, we would not recover as much cash under a UCA Although we would still get a significant amount of cash under a UCA funding mechanism as we would have if we actually definitized the contract because under the LRIP 9 and 10, we would expect to have performance-based payments and performance-based payments where we are on the contract today would actually give us greater cash recovery than with the UCA. I hope that made sense. As to impact on margins and so forth, I wouldn't expect one or the other to have any impact whatsoever on the margins we're negotiating. The only sort of economic impact that we're seeing and we have raised this with the government is, depending on how long this shortfall lasts and I gave you some numbers relative to the shortfall, we could be – if we choose to fund and again avoid the disruption of the, particularly the supply chain on the program and the international partners on the program, if we chose to fund, we probably would have to get in the commercial paper market bigger than we are. And that's not something we look forward to and that's probably something that we'd have to have a conversation about what's equitable if in fact that takes place with the government. So, a potential for a negative on the commercial paper, but we would expect that there potentially could be some consideration for that. If in fact that's what happened, but that is not our plan as I said.
Jerry F. Kircher - Vice President-Investor Relations: Kat, this is Jerry. I think we've come up on top of the hour here. So, I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for final thoughts.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jerry. Well, as we conclude the call today, I want to wrap up again by highlighting that the corporation completed an exceptional quarter and we continue to build on our year-to-date momentum with an increasing DoD budget and a robust backlog. The corporation is positioned for top-line growth and strong cash flows in the future. Thank you again for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you in our next earnings call in October. Kat, that concludes the call for today.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in today's conference. That does conclude the call. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you, Abigail, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to have you with us as we review our first quarter results and full year outlook for 2016.  As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter financially and operationally. The Corporation continued to perform at a very high level in delivering critical solutions to customers while returning value to stockholders. I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including an update on our Sikorsky activities as well as the current status of the strategic disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business to Leidos.  Turning to the quarter. Our team continued to deliver broad based results across the Corporation, with achievement of first quarter financials that exceeded all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the Information Systems & Global Solutions business. We will adjust our financial outlook when the disposition of IS&GS is completed, which we continue to anticipate will be in the third or fourth quarter of this year.  Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts. One of the standout items in our financial results is the strong performance of cash from operations. Consistent cash generation is a financial hallmark of our Corporation and enabled us to return over $1 billion to stockholders this quarter through dividends and share repurchases.  I would also note that share repurchases year to date have reduced the outstanding share count to approximately 304 million shares and this lower level illustrates the progress we are achieving on our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017.  This longstanding goal does not consider the additional share reduction opportunities from the pending disposition of IS&GS. We anticipate further share reductions will be accomplished by a stock exchange contained in the deal transaction. Additionally, the $1.8 billion special cash payment to our Corporation at deal closure also provides cash deployment and share reduction opportunities.  For the full year of Sikorsky operating as part of our Mission Systems and Training business area, I'd like to offer my high level perspective on their activities. Integration actions are progressing well as we work to transition Sikorsky operations into Lockheed Martin. As we perform the integration, we continue to evaluate the best-in-class processes, procedures and tools. Our goal remains to identify and apply the best practices across the enterprise throughout the integration process. We continue to see cost reduction and efficiency opportunities emerging as we work as one team with Sikorsky. Areas like supply chain where multiple business areas procure similar materials have allowed us to look at where we can realize better buying power and align procurement specifications. By utilizing best-in-class processes from across the Corporation, further efficiencies can be achieved and will help ensure we capture the synergies identified from this acquisition.  Moving to an operational perspective. Significant progress was achieved on the CH-53K program for the US Marine Corps. The second prototype test helicopter achieved first flight in February, providing additional assets to the flight test program and expanded our ability to achieve future critical milestones. We look forward to demonstrating the maturity of the aircraft through the current development phase. Since the end of the quarter, we received a contract from the US Navy for long lead items required for the first two CH-53K helicopters on low rate initial production Lot 1. These initial units are part of the naval aviation procurement plan to field 200 helicopters on the program in coming years.  In the area of commercial helicopters, we're seeing some emerging interest from other customers beyond the oil and gas sector for S-92 platforms and we are pushing aggressively into the search and rescue, VIP transportation and international military segments. We also see a significant potential to create additional value in these sectors in sustainment. To pursue this area, we recently opened a state-of-the-art customer care center in Connecticut, that is designed to enhance platform reliability and ensure 24-hour availability to customers’ aircraft needs. Overall, I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for long term creation of the rotary aircraft business to customers around the world. Turning to our Information Systems & Global Solutions business area. Key events associated with the pending. strategic disposition included successful clearance of the Hart-Scott-Rodino regulatory review in the United States, satisfying one of the key conditions to deal closure. The only remaining review of competition impact is in process in the United Kingdom.  We also filed the required registration statements last week with the Securities Exchange Commission. This filing and a comparable filing by Leidos initiate a review process by the SEC staff. Once the review process is completed, a prospectus describing the terms and conditions of the exchange offer and transaction will be provided to Lockheed Martin stockholders. Switching to some brief comments on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Overall the program continues to progress on satisfying remaining development activities while also ramping up the production rate. Several noteworthy events were achieved this quarter and included completion of the first Transatlantic F-35 flight from the Italian final assembly and checkout facility to the US to enable commencement of training for Italian pilots, surpassing 50,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations.  And lastly, we also successfully conducted first flight of the software required to achieve initial operational capability of CTOL aircraft to US Air Force. Achievement of this milestone enables the program to progress towards IOC scheduled later this year. I will conclude my remarks by recognizing the difficult but necessary workforce reduction actions implemented this quarter by our aeronautics and IS&GS business areas. As stewards of the enterprise, it is a business imperative that we remain agile and competitive in our cost structure.  In response to dynamic business conditions, these businesses implemented voluntary and involuntary headcount reductions. While these reductions resulted in a special severance charge in the quarter, they also significantly improved our competitiveness and ability to win future new business opportunities with a leaner cost structure.  I’ll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail and then we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks Marillyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3, and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.7 billion, slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $2.58 which included the impact of about $100 million in severance charges associated with planned headcount reductions.  We generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations, a good start to the year. We returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. And because of our better than expected performance, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. So we're off to a strong start in 2016. On chart 4 we compare our sales and earnings per share in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about $1.6 billion higher this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of MST for about $1 billion -- and more than $600 million in growth at Aeronautics driven by about $400 million in higher F-35 production volume along with higher C-130 and C-5 aircraft deliveries. Earnings per share were lower than last year, but this year's results include the severance charges for reductions in Aeronautics and IS&GS, as well as the headwind effects of the Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustment and integration costs. On chart 5, we will discuss the cash return to our shareholders in the quarter. With nearly $1.6 billion of cash from operations and slightly more than $150 million of capital expenditures, we had $1.4 billion of free cash flow this quarter. And with over $500 million each in share repurchases and dividends, our total cash returned to shareholders was 73% of free cash flow. With our share repurchase level in the first quarter we are right on track to our plan level of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year. If you will turn to chart 6, we will provide our updated outlook for 2016. Because of our strong performance in the quarter we are increasing our yearly outlook for all key financial metrics. We are increasing our sales outlook by $100 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million due to our performance in the first quarter. We are increasing our earnings per share range by $0.05 per share and I will discuss that in greater detail on the next chart. And we increased our outlook for cash from operations by $100 million, consistent with our improved profit outlook. Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit results in a $0.26 increase in EPS while the $100 million special charge associated with our severance actions reduces our EPS outlook by $0.21, netting to the $0.05 increase that I mentioned on the prior chart. On chart 8, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. The $100 million increase in sales is due to the improved outlook we have for IS&GS after its better-than-expected results in the first quarter. We are reaffirming the sales ranges for the other four business areas at this time. Chart 9 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our operating profit outlook in four of our five business areas with Aeronautics, Space Systems and IS&GS increasing $25 million each while Mission Systems and Training was increased by $50 million. And finally on chart 10, we have our summary. Our strong start to the year led us to increase the outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. We continue to provide significant cash returns to our stockowners and we remain on track to complete the IS&GS RMT transaction later this year. With that, we are ready for questions, Abigail.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.
Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning, Marillyn, Bruce. Good quarter. A couple of just quick ones on the margin. I noticed that the profit contribution from the C-130 that you called out on the $200 million and higher revenues is only $10 million and sort of implies a lower margin than we would think is normal for that. I wondered if there was a negative offset there? And then as a second one, in the guide I noted the sales in MFC have obviously been strong and benefited from I think some of the consumable stuff and some of the stuff you highlighted in the release. But the guidance didn't increase there and I wondered if there was again an offset to call out for the full year. Thank you.
Bruce Tanner : Thanks, Carter, thanks for the question. So the first one I think was your margin contribution question relative to C-130. And you picked up right. I think we had a $190 million increase in sales and about a $10 million or so increase in profit is what we called out I think on the earnings release. This is somewhat of what I talked about I think either in October or January where we are sort of finishing kind of an older, I would say, multi-year contract – it’s more than a multiyear contract, but an older contract of C-130s that we performed well on. And it’s at the tail end of that contract and we are starting off with sort of the new deliveries and new performance on the new multiyear contract that was just negotiated. So some of that is sort of the resetting, in my words, of the profits -- initial profit booking rate on the C-130 contract. As I have said all along, I still think the economics between the two contracts are very similar. But as is our sort of historical practice, we are starting that program a little lower than we ended the last program for C-130s, if that makes sense. On Missiles and Fire Control sales, you are right. We did not increase for the year. We are watching that closely. I will just leave it that as we sit here in the first quarter didn't feel like now is the right time to look at that. I think there is some upside opportunity. We have seen some good signs particularly, as you said, Carter, in some of the consumables particularly with some of our Middle East customers. But I am watching this to see if it perhaps warrants something later on in the year, but not at this time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Doug Harned : Thank you. I'd just like to follow up on the Missiles and Fire Control side, because you also in the release talked about it sounded like more a timing issue with contracts on missile defense, you referred to PAC-3. Can you talk about when you look at international contracts, particularly in the Middle East on missile defense, where you stand today in terms of the maturity of those programs? Because it appears you may be in some that are earlier stage and perhaps lower margin at this point than when they mature.
Bruce Tanner : Doug, I will give that a shot. So I think the watch item in terms of the air missile defense programs for the Middle East are more in the orders expectation for this year rather than I will say the margin expectations. You should think of essentially all of international orders for both PAC-3 missiles as well as the THAAD program are sort of combined with US orders. So they will perform essentially at parity with US orders over that period of time. There is not per se any greater risk associated with the Middle East portion of the order than the US military portion of the order, if you will. And this again is somewhat akin to what I talked about just now in the C-130 where we have sort of a shifting from an older contract where we closed out a good performing contract and a newly negotiated contract where we are starting off at our typical pattern, probably a little more conservative than we expect to make. And that’s exactly what’s going on in both PAC-3 and THAAD programs as we negotiated some new contracts and they are starting off slightly lower margin than what we experienced at the end of the previous contracts that finished up. Again, economically I'm not sure there is a whole lot of difference between the contracts, but sort of from a booking perspective that’s the way that is playing out. But I wouldn't attribute that necessarily to any greater perception of risk that we have associated with those deliveries.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Safran of Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran : Thanks, good morning. I had a bit of a multipart question here on trying to get an update on the F-35 margin profile we should expect. So in 2016 I think you are north of about 8%. As you ramp up production and some of the low margin development work winds down, I want to know if you could comment on what the margin progression should be. How quickly do you think you can get to F-16 types of margins? And if you would, could you comment on F-35 sustainment and if that could drive upside to margins?
Bruce Tanner : Hey Rich, I will take that one as well. So, F-35 margins are going to vary over time. I think from a big picture perspective we do expect them to increase sequentially year over year. We talked about last year being an expectation of a 100 basis point improvement in the overall margins of the F-35 program. We achieved that. I think I talked about again either October or January the fact that we thought margins on F-35 would be higher in 2016 than 2015. We still expect that although not at the same 100 basis point improvement as we saw in 2015. And we would expect that trend to continue in 2017 and 2018 as we start to sort of progress to what you are describing, Rich, which is our ultimate expectation, which is that by the time we get to full rate production the margins on the F-35 program look very, very similar at a very similar stage of its life cycle as F-16 margins, F-22 margins, C-130, et cetera.  So, I don't think that we are deviating from that expectation. Interestingly, as I look at some of the numbers in front of me here, we had probably slightly higher pickups on the production program last year in the first quarter than we did this year, although we did have profit step ups on production contracts this quarter as well. If I look at last year's first-quarter results -- and I know I didn't talk about this last year -- we were actually close to 10% on the production program. So, it will sort of peak and valley depending on the step ups and when they occur and how many of them occur on multiple production contracts in the same quarter. But our expectation again is we will get to sort of legacy program margins when we get to full rate production. Your second question was on the F-35 sustainment margin. Those are typically negotiated at pretty comparable margin levels as the production program. So it’s not at this point sort of either a drag or a benefit at this point in time. It is growing fairly rapidly and we are going to start seeing some of the sustainment contract sort of split out of the production contracts as this volume gets bigger. So we may in the future end up talking about sustainment separately from production. But you shouldn't think of that as being a whole lot different than the production margins at this point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi : Bruce, I wonder if you could just talk about kind of Sikorsky performance relative to expectations at this point from a revenue and margin standpoint. And then also, just as you look into 2018, I think that’s when the required contributions start again for the pensions. So just based on current assumptions can you talk about what the contribution could be in 2018?
Bruce Tanner : Sure, Joe. Thanks for the question. So I would say Sikorsky -- and look, we are still early into the integration and into the incorporation of Sikorsky into our results. So I am still getting my head around describing Sikorsky and what the expectation should be and shouldn't be. I would characterize the first quarter as pretty much in line, maybe slightly better than our expectations. That’s both from a revenue perspective as well as a margin perspective or an EBIT perspective. We are sort of front end loaded during the year with these things I talked about in the last quarter's call, these customer lien rights that have sort of depressed the sales because of sales for products that were recognized prior to our ownership. That plays out sort of for the most part in the first half of this year. So we would expect to see sort of sequential growth in sales at Sikorsky quarter over quarter with the fourth quarter obviously being the highest quarter of the year.  Similarly, we expect to have the margin profile for Sikorsky increased quarter over quarter, again obviously having the fourth quarter being the highest margin quarter as well. And this is again some of the timing of the customer lien rights in the first half of the year as well. So I’d say just big picture, that’s pretty much in line with what we expected to happen in the first quarter, and we’re going to watch it throughout the year, we’ll give you updates as we go and progress through the rest of the year. Secondly, Joe, you asked the question about 2018 pension funding. So we had described several years ago our expectation that we were going to have a three year pension holiday – cash funding holidays I called it, I think and that was 2015, ’16, ’17, and unfortunately that holiday does stop at the end of 2017 and in 2018 we would expect to have to start making cash contributions to the pension plan as well going forward. I think as we sit here today, Joe, that’s probably somewhere north of probably $1.5 billion or so. But importantly, I think you shouldn’t think of that as necessarily being sort of taking the current run rate of cash and subtracting, so say, $5 billion and subtracting $1.5 billion, and we’re down to $3.5 billion. We expect by 2018 to have much greater cash from the Sikorsky acquisition as well as cash from the other business areas that’s going to offset most but not all of that pension contribution. And we also get a tax benefit of that as well. So we get a cash tax benefit associated with that. So it’s somewhat mitigated in 2018, so you shouldn’t think of as sort of falling off the cliff from 2017.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
Ron Epstein : Good morning. Can you just walk through the laundry list of upcoming competitions that we should keep an eye on? I mean, we all kind of know Trainer [ph] is happening and maybe you can make some commentary on that. But what’s on that list of stuff we should keep our eyes out for?
Bruce Tanner : Hi Ron, this is Bruce. Did you say competitions or just bigger awards coming up or do you –
Ron Epstein : No, competitions, yes, competitions, right. So we have got Trainer and what else do we have on the horizon? 
Bruce Tanner : You know, there is not a whole lot of – I’ll say large dollar strategic competitions coming up, even Trainer is likely going to be -- the decision is likely going to happen in 2017 as opposed to 2016. Another large one that we are watching is JSTARS, but that’s probably not a 2016 decision either. Most -- frankly most of the -- I will say the strategic competitions that I think is at the heart of your questions would probably not be in 2016. I mean these are things like long range -- or the LRSO competition, the TBMD -- GSBD, excuse me ground strategic ballistic deterrent. But those are probably ‘17 and even beyond as far as the real big pick of strategic items. And beyond that, I mean the one we are watching obviously closely, which I wouldn't characterize as a competition, but MEADS in Germany is one that we are hoping to close perhaps at the latter part of the year. And I'll let Marillyn add some color to what I've just said.
Marillyn Hewson : The only other ones I would say that we are watching are some of our international partners making their decision on F-35 buys. So Denmark is coming -- they are going through their process and Canada will ultimately. But we think the best choice for them is F-35, but they will go through their process for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn : Good morning. I wanted to ask really a two part question on IS&GS if I could. First, I think as you both stated, the business is doing a little better than perhaps you guided for and you have tweaked up the guidance there. So wanted to talk about whether that is just timing on some of these program closeouts or pricing environment which I think you cited pressure in. Maybe it’s little better than expected.  And then separately, Marillyn, the deal was contemplated I think on what the business will look like at the time of transaction. But of course that’s a nine-month period. And so, from the time of announcement, how do we think about some of the puts and takes and strategic things that you are doing with regard to headcount vis-à-vis that new management team? Are these things that were negotiated? How do we think about that? Thank you.
Bruce Tanner : Well, let me take the first part of that question, sort of the IS&GS performance. And I will say I mean obviously we increased the outlook for both sales and profit. So it’s exceeded our expectations. I think there is a couple of things going on and some of them are a little subtle. So sales is just -- this is a tough business to sort of predict what -- which competitions are you going to win, which ones are you going to not win. And you get scenarios where things get protested even if you lose and therefore you can actually get the sales stretch out of those. We are sort of seeing all those happen at the same time. The one thing I am really pleased with probably more than anything, even higher than sort of the sales volume because, again, that’s a little bit hard to call, is the better-than-expected earnings performance and the margin performance. This was a quarter where we had a pretty significant write off on an international contract. And even with that write off we still exceeded our expectations and we still, as obviously we said earlier, increased our guidance for the year. I think that’s sort of due to three reasons, at least as I look at it sort of big picture wise.  One, we had expected a number of re-compete activities to occur on some of our larger contracts in the year. And these, we bid those probably more aggressive than the previous contract where we were the incumbent. And because these contracts are actually being protested we are continuing the performance on the older contracts which are at the -- if you will, the higher margin on the incumbent contract. So it’s good for us from both a sales perspective and more importantly on the margin side because of that. I think we also had better performance on sort of the closeout or transition of some of the programs that we lost. So you should think that most of these contracts tend to have transition periods that extend for some period of time. We are actually performing very, very well on those transition periods. And taking some cost out as we end the program higher than our expectations which are resulting in higher margins. And then the third thing I would just say is really just across the portfolio, strong performance by the IS&GS team. And I think credit goes to that team. I think it’s indicative of the fact that they haven't taken their eyes off the ball. It’s a well-run organization and the entire team understands that the mission that they perform for their customers is important no matter who they work for. And I think we are seeing that play out live and in person in front of us here. I will ask Marillyn to answer the other question you asked, Robert.
Marillyn Hewson : Yes, I will pick up on the second part where you asked about at the time of transaction how to think about some of the puts and takes and the headcount and how we think about it. First, I just want to build on what Bruce said. I mean this is a management team that’s running a business. They have outlined some commitments for the year and they are performing the commitments and the whole entire team in IS&GS is making sure that their cost structure is in line with the business base that they have. So, as they look at what they need to do to be competitive in a very competitive environment that they operate in it is ultracompetitive. And it’s an area that you have got to constantly be watching your cost and you have to manage to that. There is close coordination with Leidos as they make headcount reductions. Certainly we have an agreement as we are going through this process to closing the transaction. So actions that we take on the Lockheed Martin side, they are aware that we are going to take those kinds of actions. But it is our job to continue to run the business to perform well on the business. It’s in all of our best interest and we will continue to do that with an excellent team that’s working that every day.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS.
David Strauss : A couple questions within one, I guess. First, can you talk about only six F-35s that were delivered in the quarter? Was that your plan or was that actually below your plan? And then on Sikorsky, can you talk about -- it looks like MST that you are guiding for fairly flat EBIT from here through the rest of the year. But I would think, as you have commented, Sikorsky is expected to get better. And whether you are still tracking a plan for Sikorsky as a neutral to earnings in 2017? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner : Thanks, David, good questions. So the six F-35s probably a little lighter than we expected and there is probably three or four different reasons for that. But none of them that will play out I think. By the time we get to the end of the second quarter I think we will be back on track at the end of the second quarter. And we are very much on track to have the 53 aircraft that we talked about in the first quarter or the last call in January, excuse me, delivered for the year. So no issue there. Some of it was just sort of the transition between lots and getting new acceptance for new software and the like that delayed some of the deliveries. But sort of from a production or manufacturing side there is no issue there, it was more of a, I'll say not quite administrative but not a production issue there. You talked about Sikorsky within MST and guidance looks like sort of flat earnings for the rest of the year. That’s what we are showing, David, in the outlook there. And even with the $50 million increase in guidance from an earnings perspective with MST, that’s one that we are still watching closely. It’s a little early in the year to go more than that, but I think there is some potential upside in the numbers that we have got on the table right now. If you just do the math the way you did it, David, with including the Sikorsky uptick for the rest of the three quarters of the year you'd kind of come to that conclusion I think as well. And then lastly I think the Sikorsky -- you asked about Sikorsky being neutral in EPS. So all this has to do with the share reduction from the Reverse Morris Trust transaction and expectation of some of the bleed off of the transition costs or transaction costs including the integration. That’s still our expectation, David, is that will be neutral going into 2017 with all of the pluses and minuses going into that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.
Peter Arment : Bruce, a question on kind of just big picture on the backlog. You closed in 2015 at a record level and then we had a little bit of a downtick here this quarter, I guess timing related. On IS&GS you are going to lose that. Is there a number that we kind of should be looking for, for where you think backlog ends up at the end of the year? And then just, Marillyn, if I could -- related to that, how are you looking at kind of the international front? We have seen a healthy drop in oil over the last 18 months. We haven't seen a big impact on your awards, but just seeing if you are seeing any behavioral changes. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner : So, Peter, I will answer the backlog question. So, we were down in the quarter after the record backlog at the end of last year. Actually we were ahead of plan in the first quarter, I think a couple billion dollars worth or so. So that may not be apparent; even though it was down, it was not down as much as what our plan had suggested it might be. An interesting thing, we are going to have probably a little bit of an opposite or unusual pattern to backlog this year, at least as we see it, the orders this year. We are probably not going to have as large a fourth quarter from an orders perspective as we ordinarily would. The largest quarter is actually third quarter this year and that’s sort of the planning and the biggest single ticket item there is the definitization or award of the LRIP 10 contract on F-35 and that’s worth a significant amount of money. Depending on when that happens and when IS&GS' disposition we could actually see potentially $100 billion worth of backlog that will quickly dissipate with IS&GS' disposition. And if I was to pick a number it’s probably going to be somewhere between $90 billion and -- low $90 billion to $95 billion by year end is the expectation. We were sort of expecting at about almost $4.5 billion or so, $5 billion drop, steady run rate with IS&GS in the mix. And when you take out IS&GS it gets down to that $90-ish billion level.
Marillyn Hewson : And Peter, I will pick up on your question relative to impact of oil prices and what it might -- what we are seeing on our awards. We often talk about this because we are trying to watch. We are not seeing a pullback on essential national security assets and what these countries need. What we are seeing is that there is a couple of them that we are watching. And particularly one that’s in our numbers and that we are watching very closely is the Qatar THAAD order because that’s something that we are hoping to have in this year and it is in our plan -- it could potentially delay. I think it’s not an indication they are not going to buy it. To me it’s just a matter of them balancing with pressure on their budgets with oil prices, balancing what they can buy. And I think we will see probably some of that, maybe it will impact some volumes or delays in some orders. But the bottom line is you know the conflict in that region, you know the challenges they have from a global security standpoint. And because they have increased security responsibility since the US is not so prevalent there, they are having to step up and buy the things that we need -- that they need in order to protect their citizens. So we anticipate continued demand, it’s just a matter of maybe some things will slip. That’s not unusual in the international marketplace even on a good day. I mean we don't always see things come right online with what we anticipate anyway because as they are dealing with multiple procurements they may have to do it more serially sometimes and get one out of the way before they move on to the next. And so we have to wade through that process.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Sam Pearlstein : Can you talk a little bit about ULA? You had said you thought it would be flattish this year; it looks like it was down a little in the first quarter. And at least the press talked about a further headcount reduction this year and then again next year. So trying to just think about how severance would flow through. And then if I could follow up with a second one. Just in your proxy you removed the orders category from some of the incentive comp and just want to talk through why you would have made that change at this point?
Bruce Tanner : Yes, Sam, I will take the ULA question. So ULA was down in the first quarter in terms of the equity earnings. It’s purely timing, we actually expect ULA's earnings will be higher in 2016 than 2015. That’s actually -- the primary reason behind the guidance increase in Space Systems is in fact because we do have a higher expectation of ULA. The severance charges that were taken on ULA, I don't think you will see much impact of that in the numbers and that’s just a little bit of -- you have got the severance costs offset by the lower cost once the people are removed. And that will, I think at least in 2016, be somewhat neutral for the year. It’s a little too early for me to call 2017, but that is the expectation for 2016. Orders in the proxy, we had a lot of discussion about that, Sam, and we actually had -- and Marillyn can comment on this as well obviously -- but we actually had a lot of discussions with the Board and our compensation committee. And the concern was that because orders are so variable, I mean a perfect example perhaps is you can imagine a scenario where we had won the bomber program in 2015, but it had been protested and pushed out in 2016. Do you give actually someone credit for having won it or do you say you missed it because you didn't bring it home? I mean these are some of the real-life conversations that we had. And we ultimately decided that sales, earnings and cash flow were better measures of the actual performance without the customer vagary going on there in terms of awards. I'll remind you also that we do have an incentive compensation metric associated with the focus programs. And the thought was as long as we win the right programs, I mean whether or not -- I will make this up -- whether or not the fiscal year LRIP 12 on F-35 happens in December or January is probably not as important as winning some of our critical competitions. And so, we decided to sort of focus more on the critical competitions as opposed to some of the timing vagaries associated with orders that really don't influence the economics or financials of the company whether they happen again end of this year or beginning of next year.
Marillyn Hewson : Let me just add to that. I think Bruce has covered it well, but just -- if you look at how we have outlined our incentive compensation, we have very clearly on the financials sales orders and cash -- I mean sales even cash as you see. And then where the orders come into play is in the strategic and operational area. And that is still an element of compensation. We look at it more in terms of focus programs, as Bruce said, or programs that we need to continue on contract growth with and keep sold and keep them forward. But as we flow down those metrics throughout the organization, the individuals in the organization are still going to be tracking their orders, they are still going to be driving to achieve levels of financial performance on the orders front. So, it’s not something we have taken out, it’s just that we have looked at it more realistically on how we -- what we should be compensating for in terms of incentive compensation. And it’s still an element, it’s just not outlined as a digital requirement.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro : Bruce, I wanted to pursue on the F-35 margin, you said last year was 10% obviously including the one-time catch ups. Given that this year the profit was only up $30 million on $400 million sales increase, obviously that relates to having lower pickups. Could you tell us though what the F-35 margin actually was this year and maybe kind of what the run rate has been going at?
Bruce Tanner : Yes. So, George, it’s a little lower. I mean the reason I highlighted the first quarter of last year, that’s probably the high point of any quarter in the history of the F-35 program. And that’s to say that is what we expect eventually to become sort of standard practice is that will be a double-digit program going forward just as F-16s, F-22s, C-130s and you name the program are. First quarter of 2016 is a little less than 2015 but not much less. We still had good performance, and you should think of that as even though the step ups were lower, sort of the run rate of the program is higher. And therefore it’s almost comparable but not quite to what we performed in 2016 -- excuse me, in 2015 in the first quarter compared to 2016.  Run rate, as I said to the earlier question, I have lost track now who asked it. But our expectation is we still do expect to have margin improvement on the entire program, including the development contract. But the total F-35 program this year in total is probably 50 basis points margins higher than it was in 2015. So again, nice progression, not quite as high as the 100 basis points we talked last year but still progressing nicely and sort of in line with what I have said all along which is that double-digit by the time we get to full rate production.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman : So on F-35, I think we all understand that there is a lot of good progress that has been made but that there is also still challenges ahead. So when you think about those challenges, which we read about fairly often, if the development portion of the program was to become extended, let's say, into 2018 in terms of financial implications, I am guessing they are fairly -- there is fairly little exposure to you. But are there concurrency implications to that? For example, if there are issues that delay the program further is the exposure for you sort of in going back into and making upgrades to aircraft? And could you talk about how much we should be concerned about that if at all?
Bruce Tanner : Yes, let me take a shot, that’s a really good question, Seth. And let me just give you hopefully a thoughtful answer to your question there. So the challenges that we have on the development program are surely winding down as we are progressing through a lot of the changes. A lot of the -- I will say the impacts that might result -- your question sort of tallied what’s going on with concurrency changes if in fact of the development program stretched out. Most of the structural types of testing that could result in I will say large concurrency changes, we should have a really, really good idea of where those are probably by the end of this year or in the middle of next year as we complete sort of the fatigue testing and the multiple useful life testing of all three variants. We are -- I have lost track off the top of my head where we are in progressing on that, but all three variants are well past a single useful life in terms of their durability and we are in 150% of useful life and beyond I believe for where we are on the testing of that. So most of the structural items I would say, I wouldn't expect to see huge concurrency impacts. There may be some relative to some software changes that come out of it relative to some testing and particularly some of the armament testing later in the developmental program that might result in some software changes. I don't typically view those as sort of concurrency issues. We are still on track for the IOC of the USAF later this year. We are making really good progress on the software to accomplish that.  The Atlas program is probably the other thing that we all have our eyes on in terms of this is the sustainment vehicle that sort of is your one-stop shop for sustainment on the F-35 program. And the huge amount of software that we are doing there is high on our list of things to be mindful of. But I think that’s still going to support the IOC and whatever that's scheduled the fourth quarter or so of this year. I remind you the development contract is still cost reimbursable. And I know your question was more on the concurrency. But we really do think most of the concurrency risk starts to fade pretty measurably once we get past these testings the latter part of this year and into early 2017.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton : Bruce and Marillyn, I think you talked about top-line organic growth targets of the company going forward in the 3% to 5% range with the outside contributor at Aeronautics. But that’s also where you did the headcount reduction actions. So two kind of subpart questions. One, is that growth rate still the right growth rate to think about? And two, is this more of a reactionary headcount to some of the ongoing negotiations as it relates to F-35 and/or other internal DOD competitive pressures?
Bruce Tanner : Let me try that to begin with. I will let Marillyn chime in, Myles. But so I think I have said publicly, once you sort of strip out IS&GS and you sort of re-baseline Lockheed Martin without IS&GS in the portfolio, I think organically going forward you should expect us to have about 3% to 5% growth heavily driven obviously by the F-35 program and Aeronautics in general. Also contributing to that is across all the business areas -- it may not be self evident because we've actually got some DOD contraction in some of the business areas there. But our international growth is probably going to grow from 21% or so this year to somewhere in the 25% in the not-too-distant future. So that’s helping fuel that growth as well. As far as the reductions, I would say that’s not because of pressure that’s being put on us from a DOD perspective. There is -- if you just think of sort of the lifecycle, it goes back a little bit to Seth's question there. The development program is winding down, the production program is going leaps and bounds year over year. And so, the workforce is sort of transitioning more from sort of an engineering dominant workforce to more of a manufacturing base workforce. And we are starting to see that transition occur. And that’s what some of these reductions are for is simply the lower level of sort of the development program going down and the higher production program increasing without the same number of heads required to support the manufacturing growth as what we saw in the development programs, if that makes sense.
Marillyn Hewson : Yes, I would just -- I think you have got that right on the mark, Bruce. But to add to that, it’s also changing the nature of the work that the indirect personnel support to that. And so you don't need the same number of people that are in certain roles as you move into the production phase and you ramp up that production.
Bruce Tanner : It may not be perfectly evident, Myles, but recall we did -- we, Lockheed Martin, did -- were responsible for the large bulk of the development program there. Whereas the production program obviously is a lot more of the supply chain including two large partners there. So, they are doing pretty good chunks of the aircraft from a production perspective whereas we were doing I will say more of the development program as pure Lockheed Martin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Rubel : Marillyn, there is -- not to kind of show off a little bit, but you didn't mention Pakistan and F-16s. And I suspect you probably have some other opportunities there. And then an addition to addressing that, would you also talk about a number of the items that are in the HASC mark that sure seem to play into your wheelhouse, whether it’s the F-22 restart or some new air defense system opportunities?
Marillyn Hewson : Thanks, Howard. Appreciate the question. And just from -- back to your question about F-16, I mean we continue to look for opportunities for F-16. Certainly Pakistan as it got through its congressional notification, we'll look forward to the opportunity on that. Bahrain, we hopefully ultimately at some point in the future will have an opportunity. In India we are continuing with our upgrades of the F-16, a lot of the modification work like in Taiwan, and so – 
Bruce Tanner : And the potential line started in India.
Marillyn Hewson : That’s right. Yes, we talked about that India is looking at their tactical fighter competition and we are in there with an offer to move a production line to India. In terms of the mark, the most recent mark that came out of the HASC for the defense bill, they have -- as you have seen, have added 11 aircraft for the F-35. And so we saw an increase last year in the FY16 Omnibus. And so, seeing that coming forward is important. There are also -- a lot of our programs are well supported just in the budget itself. And then with potential adds as they look at additional opportunities.  On the F-22, I know there has been some discussion about a restart on the F-22 and we just stand ready to support with whatever information we are asked to provide. You are probably aware that the tooling [ph] does still exist, and so there will be -- as most programs, if you start one from a cold start I am sure that they really want to understand the cost associated with a cold start. But at the same time you wouldn't want to build the same aircraft, so you will do some upgrades to that aircraft, modernize it and some of the design -- incorporate some of the things that we have learned through F-35 and other programs that you can incorporate into that. So we will stand ready to support that.  But the bottom line is I think our programs are well supported in the President's budget submission. And then I think the market is going through -- would potentially add some additional ones for us. And we know there is a long way to go on the budget process; it’s early days in getting through that. So we will remain hopeful that with our programs that are -- they really line up with the Department's strategic priorities that they will continue to be well supported.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.
Pete Skibitski : Yes, thanks, nice quarter, guys. I appreciate the color on Sikorsky earlier. I was just wondering if you could go farther and update us on your expectations for -- your updated expectations for intangibles amortization this year and integration costs. And how fast or what magnitude you expect that to kind of drop off in ‘17 and ‘18?
Bruce Tanner : Yes, thanks, Pete. I will take that on. So intangibles, we had said in the January call that those might move around. I think we have a year's time to sort of set the numbers there. I think we are real, real close. It’s a slight improvement in the intangible amortization. When I say slight improvement, it's a little bit slower or smaller intangible amortization in 2016 than we had originally talked about, but not enough to get too excited about to be honest with you. The integration cost, I still think that the bulk of that will be completed in 2017. And still some of that might carry over into 2018 -- excuse me, 2017 as we look forward there. I still think as we sit here today that we are tracking towards what we talked about when we did the acquisition, which was about $150 million or so per year of steady-state savings beginning in 2018. I still think that’s a good possibility that that will be the number that we are seeing then. We have got a lot of work to do between now and then. And as I said earlier, I think we're actually tracking very nicely to what our expectations were on Sikorsky.
Jerry Kircher : Abigail, this is Jerry. I think we will have time for one more question.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.
Cai von Rumohr : So, if we can go back to the severance charge, Bruce, $99 million -- can you give us some color, how does that split between Aero and IS&G? What sort of folks did you lay off? Do you expect to recover all of it this year? And if so, how come the guide for Aero and IS&G didn't go up by more than $25 million each?
Bruce Tanner : Yes so, I think the way you should think about the severance charge, Cai, is somewhere in the range of roughly three quarters is Aero, somewhere in the $70-ish million and the difference -- $70 million to $75 million maybe and the difference is in IS&GS. I don't have the numbers exactly to memory, Cai, but somewhere in that range -- three quarters/one quarter or so. As I said earlier, and I think I was talking to Myles on the question on the headcount reductions at Aeronautics. Most of these are salaried folks. As Marillyn said, some of the indirect support required to – it’s no longer going to be required to support sort of the production ramp rate that was required to support some of the developmental work that we were doing. Importantly, I think a big piece of the Aeronautics reduction was actually a voluntary reduction. And I think we actually got about what we were expecting as a result of that voluntary reduction. So we were pleased with that that people -- that it came with very few, I will say, involuntary reductions. So I think that’s a good thing as well. And then as far as the recovery of this year or not, that's still playing out, Cai. We are trying -- I mean I think in big picture terms you should expect to see a somewhat neutral reaction in 2016. And there may be some benefit depending on what the timing is of the reductions or the severance charges as they play out that may carry into 2017. We will watch that closely and monitor that as we go through the next three quarters to see if there is an impact in 2016. But if -- and if there is we will surely tell you about it. And if it happens in 2017 we will try to give you insight into that quickly as well. End of Q&A
Marillyn Hewson : So let me conclude the call for today and I just want to end by reiterating that the Corporation completed a very strong first quarter. Our robust backlog coupled with an increasing DOD budget has the Corporation positioned for top-line growth and increasing cash flows into the future. So, thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. Abigail, that concludes the call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher : Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law.

Marillyn Hewson : Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call. As today’s release illustrates, we completed another quarter of solid operational accomplishments while exceeding all of our full year financial goals and I couldn’t be more proud of our team. They remain focused on mission success for our customers and financial results for stockholders while also supporting extensive portfolio reshaping actions.  We have a number of significant events to discuss today in addition to reviewing our financial and operational results, I want to provide an update on the FY 2016 DoD budget and a discussion of two completed strategic actions, the closure of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft and our decision to separate and combine our Information Systems & Global Solutions with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction.  Financially, 2015 was an exceptional year with achievement of multiple new high watermarks for the Corporation. I was especially pleased to see the broad based domestic and international customer support for our portfolio of products. This support resulted in our achieving a record level of backlog of nearly $100 billion.  Excluding the acquired Sikorsky backlog, the rest of our portfolio achieved $84 billion, significantly surpassing the $80 billion goal we outlined at the beginning of 2015. Our backlog has us positioned to deliver expanding sales levels and financial results as we move forward in 2016 and beyond.  A second area where we achieved another high watermark was the generation of over $5 billion in cash from operations, achieving a record annual level for the Corporation in this critically important area. This cash flow is only achieved through the daily efforts and focus of our team in executing on contracts for our customers.  The robust cash generation also enabled us to expand our cash return to stockholders to a record annual level of $5 billion achieved through our industry-leading dividend payout level and ongoing share repurchase activity.  For 2015, share repurchases reduced the year-end outstanding share count to approximately 305 million shares. We are well on our way to achieve or exceed our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017.  Overall, the Corporation continue to excel in the attributes we most value providing critical solutions to customers, and returning value to stockholders.  Looking beyond 2015, our 2016 guidance outlined today results in increased sales, earnings per share and growing cash from operations. The guidance includes the Sikorsky financials from the recently completed acquisition and also reflects the realignment of our information technology and technical services businesses. The guidance also assumes continuation of the results for the full year of 2016 from the Information Systems & Global Solutions business identified in our strategic review. We will adjust our financial outlook later this year when the disposition of IS&GS is completed.  Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts. I’d like to briefly discuss the defense budgets. Since we spoke last quarter, significant uncertainty was removed with the successful completion of a bipartisan agreement of the FY 2016 base DoD budget. The new budget reflects an annual increase of approximately $25 billion, above the previously planned budget level and is also the first increase in annual DoD budgets since 2012.  The budget is a recognition of increasing global security requirements and the need to allocate additional fiscal resources to respond to the threat environment. A key element in the increased DoD budget is a double-digit annual percentage increase in the investment accounts to fund new equipment procurement and research and development activities.  This strong funding increase will be used to address the acute need to replace aging equipment while ensuring development of key new technologies to respond to evolving security requirements facing domestic and international customers.  As part of the budget we are pleased to see 11 additional F-35 aircrafts added in the FY 2016 omnibus. This marks the first time in the history of the F-35 program that aircrafts were added to the baseline requests demonstrating strong support for our largest program.  We believe our portfolio of products and new technologies will line-up very well with essential recapitalization actions in the areas of ballistic missile defense, tactical missiles and rotary aircrafts.  I’d like to now turn to the two strategic actions we announced back in July. First, we were proud to welcome the Sikorsky team to Lockheed Martin with the successful closure of their acquisition on November 6. Together, we will build upon a legacy of innovation and performance that has shaped the history of aviation for more than a century.  This action advances our commitment to provide customers with affordable, mission-ready solutions in rotary aircrafts. Their inclusion will enable us to move forward with our goal to expand our business into the strategically important areas of helicopter production and sustainment. Since the transaction closure, the combined team at Mission Systems and Training have hit the ground running. We are already seeing accelerated customer interest in both military and search and rescue opportunities emerging in the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe.  It is increasingly clear that we will be better together as we leverage our combined scale and serve as a technology leader at the forefront of vertical lift. I am enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term value creation of this business as we move forward in providing essential products and solutions to customers around the world.  Turning to our second strategic item, as announced earlier today, we completed the review of our Information Systems & Global Solutions businesses. That review culminated in our decision to separate and combine our IS&GS business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction.  We are excited about this path forward and believe this is the best fit strategically and will be beneficial to the shareholders of both corporations. This transaction is an important milestone in the portfolio shaping strategy we announced last July and allows to focus on our core business in aerospace and defense.  The combination of a proven IT and technical services businesses with Leidos will create a more diversified competitor positioned for growth and future success while unlocking value for our stockholders. This agreement aligned to the IS&GS business with an industry leader in government IT and technical services and will create an enterprise capable of providing unparalleled solutions in industries ranging from national security to health and life sciences.  The complementary portfolios of both companies will create a diversified and balanced business mix with expanded domain expertise, increased advantages of scale efficiencies and synergy opportunities. These benefits will be the foundation to create value for stockholders, customers and employees.  One of the important goals in our strategic evaluation of the business was to ensure that the final decision provides a good cultural fit and home for IS&GS employees. It is my belief that employee morale and opportunities for their growth are key elements in the future success of every enterprise.  Over the last few months, during our many interactions with Leidos, we have come to know their management and culture and we are confident that this combination fully satisfies our employee goals. Bruce will speak more about the financial aspects of the transaction and the projected timeline for closure in his remarks.  I’d like to end my remarks with a few key operational highlights in the fourth quarter that enabled the Corporation to finish the year on a very strong note. Starting with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we achieved our full year delivery goal of 45 aircrafts to domestic and international customers.  This delivery level reflects our continuing ramp up in production on the program and is a 25% increase above prior year deliveries. For 2016, w are expecting additional production expansion with planned deliveries increasing to 53 aircrafts.  The team also continued to retire key task on the F-35 development program as we look forward to completing remaining task in 2016 as the development phase winds down.  Switching to the C-130J air lifter, multiple highlights were achieved in the quarter with delivery of the 2500th aircraft and receipt of the multi-year two contracts that extends the production line into late 2019. This contract was a portion of the $26 billion in total new contract awards we secured in the quarter and it enabled achievement of a strong book-to-bill ratio for the full year of 2015.  We also made progress on growing our international sales content which grew 6% above prior year levels and expanding the international sales content to 21% of total corporate sales.  I’ll close by stating that 2015 was an exceptional year for our Corporation and we implemented both strategic actions to better position the business for operational and financial success. We secured record new business awards and cash generation, both central components to future corporate success and value creation.  Looking forward, I am enthusiastic about the future contributions we can provide to customers and stockholders with our enhanced corporate posture.  I’ll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, outline our 2016 financial guidance and then we’ll open up the lines for your questions.
Bruce Tanner : Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let’s begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales for the year were $46.1 billion, ahead of our expectations from when we spoke in the third quarter. Our segment operating margin was also better than expected ending the year at 11.9% and this enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $11.46 for the year. Cash from operations for the year was our highest ever at $5.1 billion. We returned $5 billion of cash to our shareholders in the year, led by repurchasing 15.2 million shares for $3.1 billion and we grew our backlog significantly to almost $100 million for the integration of Sikorsky into the Corporation. We will cover all these items in more detail in the coming charts so it was an exceptional year in 2015. On chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales were about $0.5 billion higher this year than last year including the addition of about $400 million of sales from Sikorsky for the short period after the close in early November.  Even without the Sikorsky sales, we were slightly higher than last year’s results and better than we had expected when we spoke in October as we had higher volume in several business areas as we closed the year. Earnings per share were $0.25 higher than last year at $11.46 for the full year and were also higher than the guidance we provided in October driven by the increased sales volume and improved performance.  On chart 5, we will discuss our share repurchase activity, we repurchased 15.2 million shares in 2015, nearly 4 million shares more than in 2014 and that brought our shares outstanding at year end to 305 million shares.  This positions us well to achieve our goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017. At the end of 2015, we have around 4 million unexercised options, which is a significantly lower level than we had several years ago and the announced transaction with Leidos creates the potential to reduce share count by up to 15 million shares upon closure later this year. If you’ll turn to chart 6, we’ll review our cash returned to stockholders in 2015. Our cash from operations, as we said earlier, was $5.1 billion and with about $900 million in capital expenditures in the year, we had $4.2 billion of free cash flow with $1.9 billion in dividends along with a $3.1 billion in share repurchases, we returned $5 billion to our stockholders in 2015, the highest amount in our history and this represents a 120% of our free cash flow for the year.  Chart 7 shows our backlog levels over the last five years. 2015 represents the fifth consecutive year that we’ve ended the year with more than $80 billion in backlog. Without the addition of Sikorsky’s backlog, 2015 would have still represented the highest backlog level in our history at more than $84 billion and with Sikorsky, our backlog is nearly $100 billion.  On chart 8, we discuss our outlook for 2016. We are expecting sales to be in the range of $49.5 billion to $51 billion and this range includes the realigned IS&GS business area for the entire year as it is our practice not to incorporate adjustments such as our RMT transaction until they have been consummated. I’ll provide more color on the sales ranges by business area in a couple of charts.  Our outlook for segment operating profit is a range of $4.9 billion, to $5.50 million and I’ll also show you the range by business area in a couple of charts. Our FAS/CAS adjustment is higher than we provided on the October call and I’ll discuss the reasons behind the increase on the next chart.  We expect our earnings per share will be between $11.45 and $11.75 for the year and our outlook from cash from operations is strong again this year at $5.3 billion, up from the $5 billion we projected in the October call. Chart 9 provides a reconciliation of the expected 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment that we discussed in October, compared with our current guidance. We had an actuarial update to the mortality or longevity assumptions that reduced our longevity estimates and results in a lower FAS expense and increased the FAS/CAS benefit by $125 million.  Our prior assessment assumes the discount rate of 4.25 – our prior – excuse me – discount rate of 4.25% increased at year end to 4.375% which resulted in a $60 million improvement in the FAS/CAS benefit.  The actual return on our pension assets was a negative 2% rather than the 0% return we expected in October, which results in a $40 million reduction in the benefit and with some minor adjustments which improved $20 million, we increased the FAS/CAS benefit for 2016 by $165 million to $975 million in total. Chart 10 provides our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area for the year and all but Aeronautics have been adjusted since we spoke in October to incorporate the addition of Sikorsky, the realignment of the Heritage IS&GS business or in the case of MST both.  Overall, sales excluding Sikorsky will be roughly comparable to our level in 2015, although 2015 finished stronger than we had expected and our segment operating profit and margin before the incorporation of Sikorsky is right in line with where we expected it to be when we spoke in October.  I want to draw your attention to MST and the incorporation of Sikorsky into that business area, as we’ve made some significant adjustments to account for purchase accounting and integration which we’ll discuss more on the next page.  Chart 11 captures the adjustments made to Sikorsky outlook for both sales and profit. Beginning with purchase accounting, the largest impact to profit is the incorporation of the non-cash intangible amortization associated with the acquisition, which lowers profit by approximately $230 million, based on current projections, which can change as we finalize our purchase accounting analysis and we impact to both sales and profit by what are called customer inventory rights.  Essentially, this recognizes the portion of government contracts that were partially completed by Sikorsky before our purchase and for which Lockheed Martin can only recognize the sales and profit that has occurred since our ownership.  This adjustment reduces sales by $400 million and profit by $30 million and is weighted much more heavily in the first part of the year as you would imagine. You will notice a similar sales reduction in 2015 described in our earnings release. Cost to integrate Sikorsky into the Corporation along with the remaining cost to complete the restructuring actions announced by Sikorsky last year before our purchase amount to another $115 million reduction in profit this year. All told, these adjustments reduced sales by around $400 million in profit by $375 million in 2016.  If you’ll turn to chart 12, we will discuss the impact for the transaction with Leidos that was announced this morning. Stockholders of Lockheed Martin will receive $5 billion of value for our contributed assets in a very tax-efficient structure. Just to put some sizing to the tax benefits, we would have needed to sell the business for almost $7.7 billion to have created the same after-tax value as the transaction we announced.  At current valuations, we would receive the $5 billion in the form of $3.2 billion in equity from Leidos for a 50.5% ownership in the newly formed company and $1.8 billion from a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. The $1.8 billion special cash payment is a fixed amount through closing, while the equity amount will vary with changes in the value of Leidos’s shares until closing.  Because this is structured as a stock split-off, an additional benefit we would anticipate is reduction in our share count of up to 15 million shares. In addition, Lockheed Martin’s stockholders who choose to participate in the split will also benefit from the synergies created by the new company, which are expected to be $120 million a year at steady state and because this is anticipated to be a stock split-off, we expect to have a significant book gain of more than $1.5 billion at closure.  On chart 13, we show the expected high level impacts on some of our future financial measures after that IS&GS transaction is complete, compared to what those results would have otherwise been had we retained the IS&GS business.  We expect our sales growth rate will be higher under the new structure. GAAP earnings per share should be neutral to slightly positive as the share count reduction from the transaction more than offsets the lost operating profit from IS&GS. Cash from operations is also expected to be higher as the increase in cash generation from Sikorsky offsets the lost cash generated by IS&GS. Return on invested capital should be higher after the transaction as a result of using the proceeds to reduce our invested capital base and we expect shares outstanding to be lower because of the stock split-off arrangement. And at the end of the day, we think the new organization better positions the company for long-term growth.  Finally, on chart 14, we have our summary. 2015 really was an exceptional performance year, particularly given the strategic actions we undertook. We finished the year strong and we set a very solid foundation for 2016. We continue to make cash deployment actions with our stockholders in mind and we believe that our portfolio shaping actions have us well positioned for future value creation. With that, we are ready for your questions. Karen?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Rob Stallard from RBC Capital Markets. 
Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. 
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Rob. 
Robert Stallard : I think we can start with the F-35. Marillyn, you mentioned what your expectation was for 2016 deliveries of this aircraft. I don’t know what the cadence might be for the few GSP on that given what we’ve seen in the FY 2016 budget and the export markets and when you might expect this program to move on to a fixed price contract basis? Thank you.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question, Rob. Well, as we are looking at deliveries for 2016, 53 deliveries as I mentioned in my opening remarks, it will grow to roughly 59 or 60 in 2017 and then by 2018 it will be up to roughly 100 aircrafts and then beyond that – so, if you look at over those three years, it’s about 250 to 260 aircrafts going forward.  And we really see that the program is getting much more stable as we continue to ramp up. The LRIP-11 is going to be the last LRIP where we will be a fixed price incentive contract and then we move into production lot one and on and that will likely be from a fixed price. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard Rubel : Thank you very much. Bruce, with all the moving parts, would it be possible for you to provide a little bit of a walk between 2015 and 2016, I mean for example, you have a couple of restructuring items last – this past year, you have a benefit of an R&D tax credit that was offset and now in the upcoming year, it won’t be offset. So you kind of have flat earnings, but the reality is there is some things that should improve as you go forward.
Bruce Tanner: Yes, thanks for the question, Howard. So, you hit – this is a very complicated quarter and a very complicated outlook for 2016 because of all the moving parts you just described. We did have a restructuring event at the end of the last year. You saw that this is in our MST business. It amounts to about $67 million.  Think of this is a sort of rightsizing that business post the integration of Sikorsky into MST. I also mentioned in the chart that shows the adjustments to Sikorsky that we are seeing some carryover what I would call restructuring charges from the actions that were taken at Sikorsky in 2015 before ownership that are somewhat carrying over into 2016.  Those now quite offset each other but it’s pretty close. As you said, we had the R&D tax credits that occurred at the end of 2015, which benefited us – it wasn’t in our outlook until it literally happened in the month of December. The good news about that is that’s now becoming permanent going forward so, because it is permanent, we’ve also assumed that in our 2016 outlook.  We had some deal closure costs that also hit 2015, think of that is about roughly $0.09 a share or so, I think about $45 million collectively for those sort of transaction costs. And then 2016 is where it gets complicated. We’ve got – as I said, the purchase accounting adjustments for Sikorsky, the integration costs for Sikorsky.  So just a lot of moving pieces there. It’s also important to note that as a result of the debt deal that we did to acquire Sikorsky, interest expense is somewhere on the magnitude of about $230 million or they are about higher than it was in 2015. So I hit the – I think most of the sort of the things are changing that are between the years, Howard, they are probably a couple I left off, but I think those are the big drivers. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay : Hi, good morning. 
Bruce Tanner: Good morning.
Hunter Keay : Bruce, can you maybe sort of follow-up on some of these – some of the math behind the Sikorsky? Can you maybe help us give a sense for what the actual underlying revenue number is for Sikorsky in 2016 and maybe think about helping us figure out sort of what MST margins would be on sort of a core apples-to-apples basis in 2016 and then maybe beyond that, think about maybe a longer-term trajectory for how you can think about getting some efficiencies out of Sikorsky and maybe a little bit of a more stable sales environment and maybe on gas side longer term in that segment?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, so – all good questions, Hunter. Let’s see, where should I begin? So, Sikorsky, because of the adjustments that we talked about for the customer inventory rights, I don’t think a lot of people necessarily had in their head that there is about a $400 million reduction for sales that occurred before our ownership if you will that are carrying over into 2016.  But that brings the sales down and profit down from what it otherwise could have been. You should think Sikorsky as being roughly the same size as the realigned IS&GS. They are kind of both in the $5 billion range, if you want to put it in that perspective. I think you asked about sort of apples-to-apples, margins from MST before considering Sikorsky.  That’s a little bit hard to do, because as you recall, and we talked about this in the opening remarks the realignment of IS&GS really affects four of the five business areas. So, if you put it just on the basis of what I’d call the Heritage MST business, before the incorporation of the portion of IS&GS that’s going into it starting this year, its margins are actually fairly comparable to what they were in 2015.  The IS&GS business, so think of this is the seed for ISR business that was previously within IS&GS. That business coming into MST is a little bit margin headwind, but it brings it down a little bit. And then I think you talked about the prospects for Sikorsky going forward, I think maybe the easiest way to talk about this – and I should say before I talk about the prospects going forward, we tried to capture all this.  I know there is a lot that I’ve just said, but I think we provide some pretty good insight in our schedules and in the press release that show the realignments to capture all the pieces I just walk through if that’s not clear by what I just said. Sikorsky, I think the biggest change that we are seeing from when we announced this deal is the changes and sort of the OEM helicopter sales in the commercial marketplace, obviously driven by the oil and gas marketplace as we sit here today.  So I think I had said at the July call that, OEM sales for commercial helos had peaked at about roughly $1.5 billion. This doesn’t include the aftermarket sales which a portion after the site but a pure helo sales is about $1.5 billion in 2014 and what I said at the time was, we thought because of the oil and gas pressures, we thought 2016 would probably half that number.  As it turns out, our current outlook is probably half of that number. So think of that as roughly $375 million or so of commercial helo sales in the year 2016, which – and think of that also as being the highest margin products within the IS&GS portfolio. So that’s some of the pressure that we are seeing.  On the flip side, Hunter, what I’ll tell you is we are already seeing the benefits, some of the combinations, particularly on the international military side. Marillyn talked about some of that in her opening remarks and what I would characterize is sort of the paramilitary side. So think of that is things like coastguard, search and rescue and border petrol fleets.  And those are actually we think upside to the plant and upside to the business case, as at least we initially look at that. But those prospects won’t impact 2016 and will frankly have much impact even in 2017 if we are successful in closing on those.  And then the last thing I’d close with, Hunter, is the cash prospects, going forward, we do expect to be much improved in terms of the current level of cash generated by Sikorsky going forward over the next few years and you should think of that primarily as the transition from development programs where we are seeing lower margins, therefore lower cash and some different terms associated with that to pure production programs that should be sort of normal cash generating business just like they would be within Lockheed Martin. Hope that covers the waterfront for you there, Hunter? 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research. 
Rich Safran : Hi, good morning. 
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Rich. 
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Rich Safran : Marillyn, Bruce, a two-part question on logistics programs. Sometime ago, you had talked about assertions against the government for extra work done on the C-5 program, this is over and above issues. I wanted to know, if this is the year when you expect that to start to flow through and is that factored into your guide? And second, on the C-130J program, congrats on the multi-year and extending production to 2019, could you comment if you have the opportunity on that program to get to the same margins you currently have? I am just getting – I was just looking to get a sense of how you see margins trending on the program? Thanks. 
Bruce Tanner: Rich, I’ll take those two. So, we had talked about the C-5 program in the past and the fact that there was some – what we thought were some over and above activities that we build it created some entitlements for some adjustments. We still believe that to be the case, but we have not factored that in our guidance for 2016.  I’d love to say it’s going to happen this year but I am not sure I am that good at predicting the future. But we do think we still have entitlement there. So hopefully that helps with that question. From a C-130 multi-year, thanks for the comment, relative to getting that done and it’s good to have that program stretch out to 2019 now. You asked about do we have the same margin opportunity.  I have described this in other forums where you should think of new multi-years as sort of starting off at a lower initial profit recording rate than probably where we ended the current or older multi-year and contract some of the C-130 programs.  So we will see some – I’ll say optically lower margins from a GAAP perspective, because we are starting that program lower, but at the end of the day, and sort of from an economic value perspective, we would expect the current multi-year program to have very similar economics and especially similar cash flows even from day one as the previous programs that we completed. So, while a little bit of near-term – I’ll say, EPS and margin pressure relative to what we have done in years past with prior C-130 deliveries, we think at the end of the day, the economics for those two programs are comparable. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thank you very much and congratulations on the Leidos transaction. So, you report IS&GS part of your numbers that guides approximately $360 million of EBIT. They are saying it will be higher, because they won’t have the pension, the corporate overhead, the home office costs. How much of those costs which looked like they are about 100 plus million? Are you able to basically cut now that if and when you kind of get rid of IS&GS in that transaction?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, so, Cai, I’ll take that one. So, we should think of the discussion in what was – what we talked about from the Leidos point of view is this is more of an EBITDA comparison than the EBIT numbers. The segment EBITDA actually that we are showing for IS&GS, so your numbers are right as usual and think of it is about $360 million of segment EBIT from IS&GS this year. I mean, the first adjustment that’s made to that to get the EBITDA is obviously to take out the depreciation and amortization.  You should think of those being collectively about $80 million because we have some level of depreciation from the capital assets there, but we also have the amortization from previous acquisitions within IS&GS and so that gets you to what about $440 million or so.  That the total EBITDA for this business going into Leidos, you should think of it as about in the $500 million-ish range and the delta to go from what I just described from the original EBITDA – segment EBIT plus the depreciation and amortization, there is a lot of moving pieces to get to the top but the biggest single one the elimination of the pension costs.  We are repaying those assets and liabilities and therefore that cost reduction is what the other benefit is to get to roughly the $0.5 billion of EBITDA for IS&GS in the new structure. 
Marillyn Hewson: And Cai, thank you for your comments. We are really excited about the transaction. So appreciate your congratulations. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning. 
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
George Shapiro: Bruce, I wanted to – couple of things here. With the 15 million share reduction at closing, that looks like it effectively offsets the dilution from IS&GS and so when you go into 2017 with the lower shares, you get at least some profitability out of Sikorsky, because this year it looks like maybe zero when you include all the amortization. So why – and you are going to get some growth from the F-35, get some growth from the budget, so why won’t the GAAP EPS be higher rather than what you say neutral to higher in 2017 and beyond?
Bruce Tanner: George, I think – my fault – I probably confused speak about the words I chose to use there. I am not trying to give you an outlook of what 2017 looks like compared to 2016. So that’s not the way to view the words neutral to higher. It’s what would 2017 and beyond look like now after IS&GS versus had we retained IS&GS.  And the words you said are exactly what I intended which is, back to Cai’s comment, we are losing, think of it as $360 million of profit that you would expect to have a negative earnings per share impact because of this split-off arrangement and the expectation that we get $15 million shares back, plus the benefits potentially of the $1.8 billion in cash tax free, that we’ll be able to have enough share count reduction to offset the effects of that $360 million or actually it’s maybe a little more than that.  And that’s all we are intending, it was not intended to say we expect 2017 EPS to be neutral or higher. In fact, we expect 2017 to be higher than 2016 for all the reasons that you just said. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about ULA and just quickly talk about what’s in there for 2016? But then also talk about your long-term plans, it would seem that, that’s a market that’s coming under some pressure as well as one where there is some competition and whether there is going to be any investment required there from Lockheed Martin at any point and just your plans for that market?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, so, really good questions, Seth. This is something, obviously, it’s a 50-50 joint venture with Boeing. So this is probably a question that was better answered from the two partners as opposed to a single partner. We had some good things happen recently relative to the ability to procure the Russian RD-180 engines and think of those for the civil and commercial marketplace.  That activity is very strong. We are seeing some benefits actually from the cargo – the CRS, I’ve lost track with the acronym stands for the crew re-supplier cargo re-supply mission where two of the three vehicles are – it’s currently slated to be launched by Atlas Vehicles. So, that’s helping us. We have some kind of bridge we think to get to the ability to have developed an American engine if you will to replace the RD-180.  Right now, it is not our expectation that that will require contributions from the parents, but that’s something that we got to work out sort of between our partner and the US government to ensure that. As you know, and as you read, we have had some commercial development activity on the engine front and we are watching that closely and see how that place out.  But you should not think this is requiring large contributions from a developmental perspective to develop that engine going forward. I think you also asked about the earnings in 2016 maybe compared to 2017. You should think of those maybe down a little bit, but actually fairly comparable year-over-year between what we had in 2015 and what we expect in 2016. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee.
Peter Arment : Yes. Good morning, Marillyn, Bruce. 
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Peter.
Peter Arment : Hey, Bruce, I guess a clarification back to Sikorsky. The long-term target on the synergies was $150 million when you originally announced the deal but given some of the pressures on the energy side, some of the restructuring they announced is that still a good number? What's the timeline we should be thinking about that? Thanks, Bruce.
Bruce Tanner: Yes, so, Peter, good question. That is still very much the plan and the expectation and that’s – that is the work that the MST team is doing now. Last year it was sort of spent in the integration mode bringing Sikorsky onboard and making sure everything can happen from the IT services to making payroll and alike. 2016 is very much focused on creating synergies and capturing those synergies.  I had said in the – in our October call, we thought we could have about $150 million sort of steady state runrate. That occurs probably in the 2018 timeframe. Again, we are seeing a lot of the integration costs occurring in 2016, that’s dampening that a bit. But the runrate is still what we expect and as I have said – and I think on previous calls, we would expect sort of the retained portion of that runrate to go down a little bit over time as we give some portion of that back to our US government on the contracts.  But at the same time, we expect to start getting revenue synergies from the combination some of which I talked about earlier on – in terms of the international military markets that will maintain that $150 million synergy runrate going forward.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Springarn from Credit Suisse.
Rob Springarn: Hi, good morning. 
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Rob.
Rob Springarn: I want to just take a high level look at sales and I think you said that ex Sikorsky you're kind of flattish for the year and I guess there is a 1% headwind here from IS&GS. But, perhaps you could talk at a high level about what's happening in space and I guess core MST and I guess a little bit in MFC to drive sales down in a year that the budget is inflecting understanding that there is some lag there, but why we don't see better growth in 2016? And then one clarification, Bruce, on the 300 million share count, you don't just get there by the RMT, but you are planning to continue to buyback stock with some consistency from what you did in 2015?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, so, I’ll answer that first. So, we are really, really close, I mean, it sort of depends on what you assume in terms of how the stock price is moving and so forth. But you should think of the RMT benefits from a share count exchange is just about getting us back to neutral and we would expect again to use at least some portion of that $1.8 billion to make up the rest and maybe there is some more on top of that, Rob.
Rob Springarn: Okay.
Bruce Tanner: Relative to – I think you asked about the, maybe three of the business areas, MST, missile and fire controls and space systems for what’s going on in 2016, maybe compared to 2015. I talked a little bit about this in the October call and really nothing has changed other than we’ve again but we’ve moved pieces around because of the realignment of IS&GS.  But at a very high level, you should think of the missile and fire control being lower than 2015, again, we’ve realigned that business to remove the tech service business that was there. But sort of the core or heritage missile and fire control is lower, again because we expect lower – what I would describe as in-theater demand for programs like the GMLRS, the missiles, javelin and some of the fire control programs.  And you should think of that as – again, this is reflecting a reduction in OCO funding for some of that in-theater activity that is very quick turn business to us. So even though we are talking about the procurement accounts going up, we don’t expect that to offset in 2016 for missiles and fire control. MST, the current outlook really makes kind of a – for a hard comparison.  So, it’s got Sikorsky for the full year in 2016 versus less than two months in 2015. The heritage – I think I have talked about this sort of the heritage MST business has slight growth. 2016 over 2015, which reflects the continuing ramp up of some of the programs that were won in 2015 for that matter in 2014 and the realigned C-4 ISR business that I talked about earlier from IS&GS is expected to have sales reductions from the 2015 level for that business that are probably comparable to what is currently shown for the realigned IS&GS business in total.  So that’s sort of what’s brining the combined if you will MST without Sikorsky to the levels that we are seeing. And then Space Systems – Space Systems is sort of a good news, bad news. A little bit lower funding for things like Orion and the fleet ballistic missile programs, but the main reason is because of lower government satellite activity in 2016 and 2015.  That’s a good news story because that says each incremental satellite that we are selling to the US government is costing less than the previous ones. We are doing about the same volume in terms of numbers of satellites but our programs to reduce costs are paying off and each one is subsequently cheaper and that’s what we are seeing within Space Systems. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton : Thanks good morning. 
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Myles.
Myles Walton : One clarification if I could, Bruce, on the purchase accounting; just what the trend-line looks like into 2017 and 2018 of Sikorsky, but on the real question, cash flow utilization in 2016, it sounds like maybe some of this is implied to go to debt pay down or reduction otherwise, it looks like you are building up your net cash balance or you could do a repurchase that is well in excess of the $1.8 billion. Obviously that's the dividend you are getting back. It sounds like, otherwise it is a pretty wholesome debt pay down or a lot of optionality on further repurchase. Where is your thinking on that?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, so, Myles, you should think, we have about – it’s not quite, but a little less than $1 billion. I think $945-ish million of debt or the maturity is coming this year in two different tranches. So we are going to pay that debt down. So think of that is about – again, roughly a little bit less than $1 billion use of cash.  The trend on purchase accounting going forward, the customer lien rights that we talked about, those are essentially through at the end of 2016. In fact, I think they end up in the third quarter of this year. So even the fourth quarter is clean from sort of the reduction associated with that and that’s both on the sales and the profit. So the only one that will sort of carry over year-over-year is the intangible amortization.  Again, as I said in my opening remarks, that’s kind of subject to little bit of a bouncing around between now and about a year after closures, so it’s purchase accounting adjustments net out. But we think, right now, it’s about $230 million a year. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ron Epstein : Hey, good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Ron.
Ron Epstein : Just - maybe a big picture question for Marillyn. When we think about Sikorsky, what do you think Lockheed can do with Sikorsky that United Technologies couldn't? Like what do you guys bring to that party that it was being starved of or whatever? How do you really create a lot of value with this thing that wasn't being created before? 
Marillyn Hewson: Well, thanks for the question, Ron. I mean, I mean, if you look at how Sikorsky is aligned with our portfolio, we’ve been doing business with Sikorsky for the past 40 years with the mission systems that we’ve put in place into the platform. So, right off the bat with that opportunity, we think that we’ve got some opportunities and cycle time reduction and some synergies that come with that.  And then, in addition to that, that’s our customer base where we sell Sikorsky as the same customer base where we are selling in the balance of our portfolio, it broadens our opportunity both in the domestic and international marketplace. It just gives us the broader opportunity to sell into those marketplaces.  So I see that as an opportunity. And then we have excellent expertise in doing business with the Department of Defense and with other governments around the world and the work that we do in our international business development, what we do with our government affairs here in the US, we believe we can make that piece of business better by bringing it into Lockheed Martin and it’s an area that we bring expertise and capability in that again allows us to do that, our customer relationships, our understanding of doing business with the US government, our understanding of doing business around the world is what we bring to that.  We also – I think understand government contracting to a great extent and we bring the expertise of our folks to that. So, a lot of areas of synergy and a lot of that is represented and some of the things that Bruce was talking about in terms of both cost and revenue synergies. The runrate synergies that we have in that since and then, Bruce, if you want to add anything along that line?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, the other thing that we bring is, maybe a little different focus, especially the – I’ll say the negotiation of government contracts – at least as we look at that, some of the terms and conditions, I think, we’ll do some different ones going forward, especially as they relate to cash.  And so, I would like to think that going forward, we will be a stronger cash generator under our ownership than what it was previously. And in doing that, I don’t think there is any sort of like, difficult to do things, it’s just sort of getting them in this case being Sikorsky in parallel to what we do with all the other business within Lockheed Martin. So, we know the game plan. We know the playbook. We just have to sort of execute it with Sikorsky.
Marillyn Hewson: The only other thing I would add is, as I said in the past, we aligned well with them in terms of focus on innovation and technology. We are always looking beyond a day and at the rotary wing area is one that is in great demand and one that we want to continue to invest in the research and development to bring better and new innovation to those platforms. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Sam Pearlstein : Good morning. 
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Sam Pearlstein : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what is happening in the international markets right now, have you seen any slowdown from the Mid East and kind of the key awards to watch this year? And then, Bruce, do you expect to have a relatively flat backlog or should we start to see you eat into that a little bit this year? 
Bruce Tanner: Well, let me just pick up on that, the international interest. We continue to have growing international interest for our programs, particularly in the area of missile defense and in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific and even in Europe, where Germany has selected MEADS as their missile defense capability and Aegis Ashore, so that is an expanding demand.  We continue to see that with some of the current conflict in the Middle East we are seeing some of our ammunitions and things of that nature that there is a continued desire for our targeting PODs and other things that they need in the current conflict. F-35, on the international front it will continue to ramp up. There is a strong interest of growth in those sales, in fact, in the next five years about 50% of the orders will come from the international marketplace.  And then, I know that there is lot of interest in terms of oil prices. We are not seeing a lot of pullback on expenditures on national security. Certainly oil prices affect our sale of commercial rotary wing, but in the balance of our business, well it does put some pressure on budgets in the countries that are buying national security assets and things that they need to protect their citizens.  The choices that they are making are on cutting in other areas, so that they hey can protect their citizens and so we are seeing a big damper on that, it maybe some things that will slip out a little bit or they might reduce the volume on the near-term, but they are still going to buy the products and capabilities and technologies they need to enable them to protect their citizens and to deal with their security issues.
Bruce Tanner: Yes, so, Sam on the question relative to backlog and would it be flat. The short answer is no. We would expect to see a reduction by the end of this year. And you should really think of that’s coming primarily from two business areas. MST, we’ll have – and when I say down, we are talking probably somewhere less than $5 billion down, maybe $4 billion and probably half or so of that is MST.  The bulk of which of that is for Sikorsky. As you might expect, we are having sales that are coming out of backlog from prior years. Orders that are not being replaced because of the – particularly the commercial business I talked about earlier with new orders. Second one is space, also down pretty – about half of that number as well and that’s just the timing of orders.  We had some very good orders in the past few years that are playing out the sales and we don’t have quite the size including the Orion order a few years back and we are not seeing those orders replicated that they are translating into sales as we speak here. So the big orders we are watching this year, not a lot of – frankly not a lot of large competitive orders that we are chasing this year.  The biggest orders we are looking for are the – sort of the follow-on F-35 orders in particular lot 10 and finalization of lot 9 and a lot of the ancillary contracts that go with both of those LRIPs. So that’s a big chunk of it. The biggest single international order that we are watching probably is a THAAD order with Qatar.  And we have other air missile defense programs kind of scattered throughout the region but not nearly at the same size as we are seeing in Qatar. But that’s the driver of the biggest international orders prospects as we see 2016.
Jerry Kircher: Karen, I think we got time for one more question. 
Operator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Joe DeNardi from Stifel. 
Joe DeNardi : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Bruce, just on aeronautics margins going forward, can you just talk about, given the booking rate increases you had on F-35, how dilutive to segment margins is that program and when is inflection point for margins within that segment and then just directionally, how should we think about FAS/CAS in 2017 at this point?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, Joe, let me try to capture those and then – and my thoughts on that. Aeronautics margin, as I said on the October call, there is really two reasons for that that are driving them below 2015. The first one being, as I call the dilutive effects of the F-35 program, even though the margins on F-35 are increasing year-over-year, there is still lower than the overall composite rate for Aeronautics and that’s bringing the rate down slightly.  The other reason primarily was the C-130 impact that I think Rich was talking about relative to the – sort of the conversion of older C-130 contracts and now booking sales under a new multi-year – again economically, I don’t see a lot of difference between the two, but from a sort of a GAAP reporting perspective, we’ll expect to have sort of a lower starting margin on the new multi-year than the ending margin on the previously negotiated C-130 contracts.  And those two are what are kind of bringing down the margins of Aeronautics in 2016 compared to 2015. I do think – I think you asked about what’s the prospects going forward. I think 2016 is sort of the bottom point, if that makes sense relative to the margins of Aeronautics.  And we would expect to see slow improvements going forward every year primarily as we see the sort of getting to a – I’ll say an ordinary production program on the F-35 program starts to take effect as well as the inevitable increases on C-130 because we are starting off at a lower booking rate that we are right now.  I think you asked about 2017 FAS/CAS, I would expect it to be – and look, I always hesitate to talk about next year. There is so many moving pieces in FAS/CAS, but if we were just sort of current course and speed, it’s always the way I’d like to describe that we are about $975 million a day. It’s probably in the $450 million higher next year if we were to strike a line today, but obviously a lot of things can change between now and the end of the year. 
Marillyn Hewson: So let me just wrap up the call for today and summarize the year and how we are looking at the business going forward. I want to end by reiterating that the Corporation completed an extraordinary 2015 strategically and financially and the performance of our team continues at a very high level, even amid our bold strategic actions that we took to position the business for future growth.  As we are looking into 2016, our record backlog coupled with increasing DoD budget has the Corporation positioned for a bright future of top-line growth and increasing cash flows. Through the focus, dedication and integrity, we continue to deliver on our commitments to customers and stockholders.  So, again, thank you for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you in our next earnings call in April.  Karen, that concludes our call today. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now log off and disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Lockheed Martin's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry F. Kircher - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our financial results and key accomplishments in the quarter, as well as provide a status update on the strategic initiatives we announced during our July earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we continue to drive towards achievement of our full-year goals with another quarter of solid operational accomplishments and financial results that exceeded our expectations. This outstanding year-to-date financial performance enables us to, again, increase full-year 2015 guidance for sales, operating profit and earnings per share. In addition to the increase to guidance, we reaffirmed the prior 2015 outlook for full year orders and cash from operation. Overall, the corporation continues to excel in the attributes we most value, providing critical solutions to customers and returning value to stockholders. Looking beyond this year into 2016, we have provided our preliminary trend outlook of selected financial metrics and assumptions. I wish to note that these trends reflect a continuation of our current portfolio. We have excluded any impacts of the pending Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation acquisition or the strategic review of our information technology infrastructure services and technical services businesses. In addition to the open elements resulting from these pending strategic actions, there is continuing uncertainty about the final level of fiscal year 2016 DoD and federal budgets. The government is currently operating under a short-term continuing resolution that limits expenditures to prior year fiscal level and is carried through December 11, 2015. For the large portion of our backlog work already funded from prior fiscal years, we do not expect significant impact to our 2016 financials from this current short-term CR. There are multiple and differing budget scenarios proposed by the White House and Congress for FY 2016 budgets. Significant differences remain between the proposed budget in the areas of funding sources and the potential use of increased overseas contingency operations funds for DoD. Reconciliation of the different DoD budget positions remains unresolved and could remain this way for some time. We hope that this is not the case as it is not in the nation's interests. A substantial delay would require an extension of the CR to enable continuation of government operations beyond December 11. While we think it unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full FY 2016 year, should the varying budget positions remain unresolved. In the event of a full-year CR, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2016 orders profile and corresponding backlog levels. We continue to urge bipartisan negotiation and resolution of the FY 2016 budget to remove the uncertainties associated with non-strategic, short-term government funding actions. We will provide updates to our 2016 outlook as additional clarity on federal budgets and finalization of our strategic actions occur. While Bruce will cover the financials in detail a little later, I want to particularly highlight our continued exceptional cash generation. This quarter, we achieved over $1.5 billion in cash from operations, bringing the September year-to-date cash generation to over $3.7 billion. Also during the quarter, our board of directors approved two key actions in the areas of cash deployment. First, we increased the quarterly dividend to $1.65 per share and $6.60 annually. This action represents the 13th consecutive year that the dividend rate has been increased by double-digit percentages. Second, we also increased the share repurchase authority by $3 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to over $4 billion. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to make share repurchases consistent with our plan to have less than 300 million shares outstanding by the end of 2017, if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit. These projected share repurchases, coupled with dividend payments, are expected to result in our returning the vast majority of annual free cash to stockholders through 2017 and continuing our longstanding strategy of disciplined cash deployment and value creation. Moving to operations. While numerous mission success events were achieved across the corporation this past quarter, I wish to highlight some noteworthy achievements on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program in our Aeronautics business. On JSF, we were extraordinarily pleased with the achievement of initial operational capability for the F-35B variant in July. The declaration of IOC by the U.S. Marine Corps makes it the first F-35 variant available for combat operations and achieved an enormous milestone for the program. Other key F-35 milestones accomplished this quarter included a number of firsts on the program, including the inaugural European flight of the first F-35 assembled at Italy's final assembly and checkout facility. This marked the first time a jet has flown outside of the United States. Additionally, rollout of the first F-35 aircraft for the Norwegian Armed Forces was accomplished this past quarter, marking an important production milestone for the future of Norway's national defense. Beyond these key milestones, aircraft production continues to ramp up, and we are on track to achieve deliveries of approximately 45 aircrafts in 2015, representing 25% higher aircraft deliveries than were achieved in 2014. Since program inception, we have delivered 140 production aircraft to our U.S. and international partners. The F-35 program continues to expand and is now generating approximately 20% of annual corporate revenues. This figure is expected to grow over the next few years as production rates increase for deliveries to U.S. and international customers. I'd like to briefly turn to a status of the two strategic actions we announced back in July. First, the acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation continues to progress through the regulatory review process. Competition-based regulatory reviews have been completed in seven jurisdictions, importantly including the United Sates where we and Sikorsky have the most activity. The sole remaining such review is ongoing in China, which we are expecting to clear without difficulty. Other regulatory activities, such as licensing and permitting, continue in process. We had previously announced that we expected to close the acquisition in either the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016. But with the progress of the regulatory reviews, we now expect to close in the fourth quarter. We very much look forward to adding the men and women of such an outstanding company to the Lockheed Martin team where we will continue to make history together. Regarding our second action, the strategic review of our government information technology, infrastructure services and technical services businesses, we continue to evaluate multiple options, ranging from a spinoff to shareholders, a Reverse Morris Trust transaction or a sale of these businesses. Exploration of these options is intended to ensure that these businesses are best positioned to address competitive pressures on what is becoming an increasingly difficult environment by improving the affordability of their products and services. This should benefit customers, our stockholders, and the employees. On that note, I particularly wish to thank the affected employees for their continued focus and outstanding performance while we evaluate the strategic review options. I believe we are on course to complete the strategic review in 2015, and we will provide an update on our action plan when the final decision is completed. I will now ask Bruce to go through the details of third quarter and full-year financial performance and our 2016 financial trends preview. And then we'll open the line for questions.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Beginning with chart 3, we have an overview of our third quarter results. Sales for the quarter were $11.5 billion, ahead of our expectations when we spoke in the second quarter. Our segment operating margin was also better than expected in the quarter at 11.9% and enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $2.77. Cash from operations in the quarter was strong at $1.5 billion and reflects an earlier phasing of cash in the second half of the year than we had planned. Our cash deployment actions in the quarter remained strong with $1.3 billion of cash returned to shareholders, including more than $800 million in share repurchases. And based on these results, we are increasing our full-year outlook for sales, segment operating profit and earnings per share. So we continue to perform well in 2015 and are positioned to end the year better than we expected when we began the year. On chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating margin in the third quarter with our results in 2014. Sales were higher by about 3% compared with the third quarter of last year, with the growth driven by the F-35 program and Aeronautics and the ramp-up of new programs in Mission Systems and Training. Segment operating margin was slightly lower in the quarter at 11.9% versus the 12.1% we experienced last year. Space systems had good performance in the quarter but could not equal the results from the third quarter last year, which were the highest of any quarter in 2014. Improved performance in Aeronautics and Mission Systems and Training helped to bring the overall margin this quarter to near the results in 2014. Chart 5 compares our earnings per share this quarter with our results from a year ago. Our EPS of $2.77 was $0.01 higher than the results from last year, but the results this quarter included a negative $0.08 impact from a severance charge associated with IS&GS. If you'll turn to chart 6, we'll review our share repurchase activity for the quarter and year-to-date. During the quarter, we repurchased more than 4 million shares for $823 million, bringing our year-to-date total to 12 million shares repurchased for $2.4 billion. Both the quarter and year-to-date totals significantly exceed our levels from last year. And we are now expecting to spend at least $3 billion for the full year of 2015, keeping us on track to bring our share count below 300 million by the end of 2017. Chart 7 provides details into our total cash returns to stockholders through the end of the third quarter. Through dividends and share repurchases during the first three quarters, we have provided nearly $3 billion in cash to our stockholders, or 117% of our free cash flow through the same period. As you can see, this is significantly higher than our actions in 2014. On chart 8, we discuss our updated outlook for our full-year 2015 results. We are not changing our guidance for orders at this time. We continue to expect that the fourth quarter will have the highest level of orders in the year with a number of large digital events such as the finalization of the C-130J Multiyear and F-35 LRIP 9 contracts and the award of a Long Range Strike Bomber program. Depending on the timing and ultimate value of some of the expected orders in the quarter, we could end the year in excess of the high end of our guidance but remain confident that under the most likely scenarios, we will end the year with $80 billion or more of backlog. Because we have increasing clarity on the year, we are providing point estimates rather than ranges for the remaining metrics. Beginning with sales, we are increasing our outlook to $45 billion, the high end of our previous outlook, reflecting higher-than-expected sales in Aeronautics and Space Systems for the full year. For segment operating profit, we are increasing our outlook to $5.4 billion, $25 million above the high end of our previous guidance, recognizing stronger performance across the business areas. We're also increasing our earnings per share outlook at the top end of the prior guidance as a result of the increased profit outlook. And we are leaving our cash from operations outlook unchanged at equal to or greater than $5 billion, but there are several large collections that could push that number higher or lower than our expectations depending on their timing. These include the collections associated with the contract finalizations that I mentioned earlier as well as the timing of deliveries in December. Chart 9 provides our sales outlook by business area for the year, also with point estimates for each of the business areas rather than the ranges we provided in the prior outlook. Both aeronautics and space systems are now above the prior high end of our guidance for sales. Chart 10 shows our current outlook for segment operating profit by business area compared to what we were expecting the last quarter. You can see that our current outlook for each business area is equal to or better than last quarter's outlook and results have increased to $5.4 billion. On chart 11, we provide our first outlook information for 2016. We expect sales next year will be comparable to the current outlook for 2015 but is driven primarily by two business areas moving in opposite directions, Aeronautics and IS&GS. Aeronautics is expected to grow at a high single-digit rate over 2015 while IS&GS is expected to decrease in 2016 by an even greater rate. Sales for the other three business areas combined are essentially comparable to their 2015 levels. Without the reduction in IS&GS, we would expect the remaining portfolio to grow about 2% over the 2015 level. Segment margin will likely be in the 11% to 11.5% range with a reduction from this year's level, attributable to several items. First, the F-35 program will grow more than double digits above the 2015 level, and while the margin for the program is expected to be higher in 2016, it is still dilutive to both the current level of aeronautics margin and the overall company's margin. Second, we are seeing a reduction of margins on recently negotiated programs such as C-130J, air and missile defense programs and others after several years of strong performance, and we've also made a number of important strategic bids that were highly competitive but which offer long-term value creation. And third, we are expecting reductions in revenue for some of our programs such as GMLRS, ATACMS, Javelin, and fire control programs as in-theater demand slows down from 2015 levels. These programs experienced unplanned demands from OCO funding that enabled better than historical margin levels in recent years. At this time, we expect our FAS/CAS benefit to be $810 million next year, which assumes a discount rate of 4.25% and zero return on our assets from the current year. These obviously can both change between now and yearend, but that's where we see them today. Our cash from operations should be comparable to 2015, and we do not expect to make any contributions to our pension plans next year. And in line with our plan to reduce share count below 300 million by the end of 2017, we expect to make share repurchases of greater than or equal to $2 billion in 2016. Importantly, please note that this outlook excludes both the Sikorsky acquisition and any actions related to our businesses under strategic review. Finally, on chart 12, we have our summary. We've had strong performance through the first three quarters of the year, and we expect a strong close to 2015. We're maintaining our focus on the cash deployment action that you've come to expect from us. And we continue to like how our portfolio positions us for the future. Before closing, I also wanted to make a few comments about the strategic actions that we announced last quarter. As Marillyn said, we expect to reach a decision on the path forward for our businesses under strategic review before the yearend, and we'll communicate that decision to you then. And when we outline our formal guidance in January for 2016, we will provide that guidance in a business area structure that will reflect all businesses under strategic review in IS&GS, including the technical services business for Missiles and Fire Control, and the realignment of the remaining businesses from IS&GS into Mission Systems and Training and Space Systems. With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question for today comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): First, I just want to dive a little bit deeper on the margin outlook for 2016. There were a couple of things that you mentioned, C-130, air missile defense, and then some strategic bids. I'd like to get a little bit more color on each of those. C-130 and air missile defense, have those been definitized at this point, or are we still waiting for that to happen? And then on the strategic bids, can you just walk us through what segments those are impacting and just kind of the competitive dynamics that are going on there?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Sort of a mouthful there, Jason. Let me try to cover all of these things. So margins, we talked about C-130, air missile defense system, other programs. So, C-130, we're just coming off of a number of contracts that were negotiated essentially with the same timeframe, and we're about to start delivering next year actually. The first aircraft associated with the multi-year contract that we're – we've just reached the handshake agreement here within the last couple of weeks. So, as you can imagine, we've done very well based on our previously reported results on those aircrafts where it's sort of a reset, if you will. When you start negotiating the next contract, you start with the exit performance in mind. And then you have to start seeing if you can improve off of that now higher bar, if you will, of that performance. So that's sort of the C-130. Again, as I said, that we did reach handshake within the last couple of weeks. The air and missile defense program, kind of a similar story, a lot of PAC-3 negotiations. So the early stages of that program, we performed very well, again sort of reset some of those contracts going forward. We just – we reached agreement on fiscal year 2014 and 2015 here recently although none of those, including the Multiyear are, at this point, definitized. We suspect that they will be before the end of the year. And then I talked about strategic bids. So just to rattle off a few of them and you should think of this as sort of impacting a lot of the business areas, not just one single business area but things like the bomber program that we're hopeful is announced this year. Obviously a very strategic bid, obviously one that does have long-term value creation for the corporation but one that we did view very strategically and we bid it accordingly. You can also think of programs such as a number of radar programs like, for instance, the Long Range Discriminating Radar, the 3DELRR program. Within our Missiles and Fire Control business, a couple of things going on there, so programs like the Joint Air-To-Ground Missile, the JAGM, that we ran recently. It's essentially the replacement of the HELLFIRE missile, obviously an important franchise program for us going forward. And then, within the ground combat vehicles, although it's still under protest, the LTV was one of those. You may not have been watching quite as closely the Amphibious Combat Vehicle for the Marine Corps but that's another one that we're tracking very closely. And then, you didn't mention that, Jason, but in the remarks that I made a comment about a number of sort of overseas contingency operations programs being expected not to be funded at the same levels going forward as they were in 2015 and previously. Think of that as there's a lot of use of the sort of the expandable items that those programs make up with sort of unplanned orders that increased the volume of activity unexpectedly higher than we have priced, and we have the benefit of that unplanned volume. We're not planning on that in 2015 going forward. So, I think that hopefully covered a bunch of the items you were talking about, Jason. And I'll stop there and go to the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey. Good quarter, guys.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Pete.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Hey, guys. On the 2016 guidance, is there upside to the flattish top line, if we do get a budget before the end of this calendar year or is a risk if we don't?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Pete, I'll take that one. I don't see a whole lot of swing one way or the other quite honestly in 2016. The vast majority of sales that will be recognized in 2016 are already in backlog or we would expect them to already be in – to be in backlog by the end of this year. Essentially, other than, again, IS&GS which is the short sort of turn business within the corporation, we would not expect orders that would be received in the fourth quarter of this year, the first year of the fiscal year for the government to necessarily translate into a lot of sales next year. And you should think that as a continuing resolution, you can't have new start programs, you can't spend more in the new fiscal year than the prior fiscal year. The rest of the business areas like IS&GS, that's not going to be a hindrance. I mean, again, we're expecting that business area to actually decrease in the volume. So, we wouldn't expect to have a huge impact from what we're guiding as a result of the CR. But conversely, as I said, we wouldn't expect to see upside either.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Good morning. How are you?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Rich.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Marillyn or Bruce, in the release, you note that you may be at risk for reimbursement in excess of cost. You're still in negotiations and the concern that current funding is insufficient to cover your production cost. I wanted to know if you could provide more clarification on your statements in the release, discuss the impact it might have on your $5 billion full-year cash flow goal for 2015. Also, and if you could just tell us when the deadline would be for receiving funding such that the $750 million you mentioned in cash you expect to collect could be pushed into 2016?
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Bruce, why don't you take that one?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Sure, Rich. Let me take a shot of that. I'll probably maybe give you more color than you maybe really want for that, but – so you should think of this affecting a number of very large programs, specifically just to name two, but it's not limited to those two, the C-130J Multiyear and the LRIP 9 negotiation. Again, C-130J, we did reach handshake, as I said earlier to Jason, just a couple of weeks ago. We're still in the process of negotiating LRIP 9. But on both contracts, think of this as where we received initial funding to start work. This is typically described as sort of long-lease funding or advance procurement funding. We literally take that money and begin to work with our supply chain to start funding the supply chain. It doesn't honestly go in the earlier stages to do a whole lot of work for Lockheed Martin because we're further down that food chain, if you will, than our suppliers. In both cases, we ran out of funding provided. In both cases, we asked for additional funding. And in both cases, we were told that none would be provided until those contracts were actually negotiated. This was a little change, frankly, from historical – my experience at least, historically as to how we get funding. Ordinarily you get long-lease funding; when you reach the end of that long-lease funding, you ask for additional funding which usually comes in the form of an undefinitized contractual action, or UCA, as it's called, or you actually end up with a negotiated contract. For whatever reason, the government in this case decided not to fund until we reached negotiation. And so, we were faced with a decision of do we actually disrupt the supply chain – and you can imagine the kind of disruption that that creates, telling potentially hundreds of thousands – hundreds to thousands, excuse me, of suppliers to stop work, furlough their employees, potentially lay off employees and then having to restart that effort. And most of our supply chains simply can't afford to fund this on their own. So, with that in mind, we decided to continue funding those programs, again, primarily funding our suppliers as opposed to Lockheed Martin. You should think also that the funding needs on these programs starts to accelerate pretty dramatically at certain points in time. In the case of both of those programs, from the summer time until the end of the year the funding needs increase dramatically. And that's why we disclosed that in the earnings released to you today; that's why we'll disclose that in the 10-Q that you'll see in a couple of days. I'll tell you, we have elevated this to various senior levels at the Pentagon. We've been told that funding will be provided on both those programs, but it does require, I'll say, a lot of paperwork, notifications, contract modifications and the like to make it happen. We think that will occur this year, but obviously a lot of cash is tied up. And we want to make sure that we at least notified you of that. Honestly, it's a little bit difficult for me to understand as to why we're in this situation. You really have to ask the folks in the Pentagon as to why we're in this spot. As far as – you did ask the question, as far as cash in 2015 (sic) [2016], above or below 2015, we do need – we identified the value of the two particular items for both the Multiyear and the F-35; it's worth about $0.75 billion. But timing-wise, we need to get that probably notification and ability to bill sometime before Thanksgiving typically to sort of get that by the end of the year. That's not always the case. Sometimes we can get it if it happens in the early December timeframe. But just to be certain, that's when it would sort of be helpful to make that happen. And you should think of this, between the two years, 2015 and 2016, if it doesn't happen in 2015 it will happen in 2016. You should think of the two years still being the same cash value, just how much of that happens in 2015 versus 2016. So, current plan is $5 billion and $5 billion. If we were short, $750 million, we would add that $750 million to next year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Noah.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I wondered if you could address this recent press about some possible fairly large corporate overhead cost reduction. It's hard to tell what's related to the government IT business review and what's part of the remaining business. It would seem like a fairly large number that's out there if it is in fact a decent amount in the remaining business. And then related or I guess, depending on your answer to that, related, Bruce, in the past you've commented when you've given your initial segment margin outlook about qualitatively how much conservatism is in it or how much upside risk there is. And I guess I wonder if there's more cost coming out than normal, is there more upside risk or not? Thank you.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Let me take your first question, Noah. I did see the press that was around a 30% overhead reduction. Let me just put some color around that for you. I mean, we are always looking at our business structure and looking at different excursions we should take in order to keep our business competitive within the business environment that we operate in. So I'm looking to target the 20%, 30%, 40%. I mean that – so just to put it in perspective, this is a matter of us constantly looking at where the opportunities are for us to be as affordable as we can and how we adjust our business base to the business environment that we're operating in. We look at the supply chain. We look at overhead and we look at performance of the business areas. Every year, the business areas set affordability targets that they then look at both production and overhead cost reductions that they can take, improvements in their processes. And similarly, we do that at the corporate level. So that's the essence of that. Bruce, I think you'll take the next part.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. No effect on – I think just to repeat your question, the initial segment margin outlook, in years past we sort of talked about potential to do better than that going forward. I'll say, Noah, 2016 initial guidance that we're providing is very similar in terms of expectations of upside or downside as to what we've done in years past. If you go back and look at 2014 and 2015, for instance, from the start of the year to the end of the year we saw improvements in both of those years in terms of the overall company segment margin because we performed better on certain programs, and that has enabled us to take step-ups during the year that resulted in that higher performance, that higher segment margin. So, as I always say, I think we have the same opportunities. As I look at 2016, that doesn't make it happen just because I think there are opportunities there. It actually takes a lot of work to make those materialize, but we surely believe we are sitting here with the same opportunities as we had in 2014 and 2015. And then I think you tried to link that with the potential reductions that Marillyn talked about. I don't see a whole lot of swing around those, even if those were at the full value that was reported in the press, which I don't particularly think there's a high likelihood of that, but I wouldn't expect that to have a very significant impact on the overall company margins at all.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Yeah. Good morning, guys.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Ron.
Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Marillyn, I have a big picture question for you. Post the announcement of the Sikorsky transaction, the DoD came out and said, you know what, we don't want to see any more big M&A and they suggested that the consolidation in the industry has been anti-innovative and then kind of notably your company came back and took issue with that. Can you elaborate on that, I mean, your thoughts on consolidation and the impact that it had or not had on innovation?
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I'll be happy to. Thanks for the question, Ron. I guess, I've had a lot of discussions with Frank Kendall and others about this policy statement that he put out and respectfully I told him that we disagree with that, that his general conclusion and his rationale that consolidation in the industry is bad for the industry. There's really no evidence to support that. There's no evidence to support that with our Sikorsky acquisition that we reduce competition or inhibit innovation in any way. And in fact, if you look at our performance, we have consistently delivered the best and most sophisticated defense capabilities in the world. We're going to – we intend to continue to do that. We successfully compete for opportunities that come about, and we invest in advanced technologies every day. We offer cost-effective solutions. We wouldn't be able to be reporting out the type of financial results that you're seeing and have been seeing for the last several years without performing well. And we're performing well for the Department of Defense. We're performing well for other government agencies and for other countries around the world in what we're doing. And so I wholeheartedly disagree that through consolidation, through some change in size of a business, that that's going to impede our innovation and somehow inhibit our innovation. I recognize that from the perspective of the Department of Defense, they have to make sure they've got a competitive industrial base. And so that – they have to maintain that proper balance. But really, we believe that you have to continue to look at how you can be most effective. It's not about the size of the company. It's about performance. I mean that's been the standard for – in our free enterprise system forever. And I think it's what makes us strong as a nation. And, actually, if you consider what would the alternative be to be a smaller company and break it up, it could actually cost you more. I think the – with the economies of scale that come with what we can bring together in our business, and how we can invest in research and development, how we can invest in the capital expenditures that we need to. And as Bruce just described to you, how we can help to fund suppliers through a period of – between contract negotiations, we would not be able to do that if we didn't have the economies of scale that we have today. So bottom line, as you can feel – hear it from my passion in my voice, we do not believe the consolidation will inhibit innovation in the industry. Thank you for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a quick clarification on the comment around IS&GS, Bruce. The higher rate that you stated, was that a higher rate of decline than the 2015 number or a higher rate of decline than the high-single digits that you pointed to for the aerospace growth, just wanted to clarify that? And then I also wondered if you'd give us a bit of an update given the Q4 close on Sikorsky, what that does in terms of the timing of the integration costs and the synergy targets that you had laid out before in terms of what – how much of that comes into 2015 or how that impacts 2016 relative to what you said on the last call? Thank you.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. You bet, Carter. So, sorry if I wasn't clear in the words to begin with on the IS&GS, but the latter is the short answer to that. IS&GS is decreasing at a faster rate than the single-digit – high-single-digit rate of growth for aeronautics in 2016. So, IS&GS will be decreasing at higher than a high-single-digit rate in 2016, if that makes sense. And then to your question as to Sikorsky and the timing and how that potentially changes integration costs and synergy costs, I wouldn't expect they would have a huge impact on the integration costs or the ability to achieve synergy. We're still looking at spending, and I think the last time I talked to you, $80 million to $100 million or so of integration costs probably in the first year. And that's in large part to accelerate the synergies that we expect are there with the Sikorsky integration. We expect that will still take place in 2016. What will change or what will not necessarily change but will be greater clarity is that now a lot of the transaction costs associated with closing of the Sikorsky deal will hit in the fourth quarter of this year. So, you should think of that rough order of magnitude, and I hope we're on the lower end of this, but probably accounting for $0.10 to $0.15 impact to earnings per share in the year. And we thought about that relative to describing that in the guidance we provided. But we're still hopeful, quite honestly, that we can have an R&D research and development tax credit that will pass this year and that offsets – that actually more – probably maybe more than offsets that impact of the transaction cost of 2016. So net-net, we would expect to see those costs hit in the fourth quarter, but we're also hopeful that the R&D tax credit more than mitigates that also in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Myles.
Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Bruce, I was hoping you can touch back on Sikorsky for a second. In terms of doing the alignment of their accounting with your accounting inside of Lockheed, how the margins of Sikorsky might behave. And then also related, as you look at the $5 billion cash for next year and substituting out the IS&GS or IT tech services business for Sikorsky, what's the put and take for from a cash flow perspective?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. So, Myles, we're going to give you in January a whole lot more insight into Sikorsky, assuming it closes in the fourth quarter of this year. We made some – obviously when we did the due diligence process with Sikorsky we made some relative assumptions as to, I'll say, the conforming accounting that we expect to do. I tried to tee that up, I think, in the last call, and I literally don't have any better information to give you than what I provided to you on the July call. I'll give you, I think, much great insight into that when we actually provide the formal guidance in January not just for the rest of the company but for Sikorsky in particular as well, again, assuming we close that in the fourth quarter. As far as the $5 million of cash next year, it obviously depends on when the strategic review culminates. We're looking at depending on whether it's a sale, a spin or a Reverse Morris Trust somewhere in probably the middle of next year to the third quarter of next year. So, I would like to think that we may be able to offset most of that if it were to spin or be sold or did a Reverse Morris Trust next year. Again, with both the spin or Reverse Morris Trust or the sale, we would expect to get cash proceeds back. I know that's not operating cash flow but it would be greater, frankly, than whatever the shortfall is that we would expect to lose with the transfer of that business outside of the corporation. So, probably a little bit of a wishy-washy answer, but I don't know given the timing of when that deal would close and the timing of the cash flow in the year for IS&GS just to really give me a good idea what that benefit would look like or detriment.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT: Yes. Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT: Marillyn, I guess, could you give us like kind of a big picture view on what you're seeing from international customers? I know there's been a lot of volatility in the oil-exporting countries, and have you seen any slippages or – and maybe just related to that, Bruce, are there any significant programs that we should be thinking about for 2016 in terms of international contracts? Thanks.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the question, Peter. We are just continuing to see strong demand in the international marketplace for our programs. Missile defense continues to be a big driver for a lot of the Asia-Pacific and Middle East countries, things like THAAD, Aegis, Aegis Ashore, Patriot needs. There is a continued demand for that. You know that we continue to have the demand for our tactical aircraft, the F-16, the F-35; and as well as mobility, C-130J. In terms of oil prices, we're really not seeing a pullback on expenditures for oil prices because, frankly, these countries are looking to meet their essential national security needs. And many of them have deep reserves, countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the UAE and others. And really, they're not – we don't see them pulling back at all on what they need to do in terms of purchasing their missile defense, their fighters. And now I think you probably have seen that Saudi is doing their naval expansion program where they've already committed to purchasing MH-60 Romeo helicopters. And now, there is a process underway with the LCS being – there is a positive momentum on their acquisition of the LCS. They have now the congressional notification for them to purchase up to four littoral combat ships for their multi-mission surface combatant. And so, we stand ready to support that sale because what they're interested in is a freedom-class LCS experience that we produce, which could – we could potentially get under contract sometime next year. We're making great progress. We achieved 20% international sales. We're now on a path to 25% of international sales. We have – for 2014, we had about $20 billion in international in our backlog, so we continue to see a strong pull for our portfolio internationally. And as I travel around the world, I just returned from the Middle East and there continue to be a strong demand.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Peter, you asked about just some of the larger maybe international pursuits in 2016 that we're looking to accomplish. Probably first and foremost, that is a THAAD sale to Qatar. This has been in discussions for quite some time and it's ongoing quite frankly, but we think that ultimately it will close in 2016. Marillyn just mentioned littoral combat ship as part of the SNEP program in Saudi Arabia. We'll see if that's able to close in 2016, but I think the prospects just got better with the congressional notification that we saw yesterday. There's numerous F-35 international buys sort of all co-mingled within the LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 contracts that we're negotiating there. But those do contain significant quantities of international customers. And then maybe just to finalize the thought there, we expect to have some modification, at least one fairly good-sized modification program on F-16s and we haven't given up on selling new F-16s to at least a couple of different prospects. And we're hopeful we can get at least one of those deals closed in 2016. So that's four, probably more than that if you include the multiple numerous customers with an F-35. Those are some of the larger ones next year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.
Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. On international sales, when I look at Missiles and Fire Control, I think of that as a unit that's a lot of drive from international sales and it's PAC-3, THAAD, different missile programs. But if you look over the last several years, backlogs have been pretty flat. Now, I know you've had some pullback on the services side and backlogs were a little bit better – got better this quarter. But can you reconcile the fact that we should be seeing a lot of international demand for these programs, yet so far we really haven't seen it reflected in a big increase in backlogs there?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. So, Doug, I'll try to answer that. I think the biggest reason that you don't see that is, one, we've seen some delays in negotiations. As I said, we just now finished actually negotiating here – I say just now, here recently we just finished negotiating both the FY 2014 and FY 2015 Patriot deals, the factory deals. Those orders, when they're finalized, are pretty good-sized. We typically don't see at Missiles and Fire Controls the sort of multi-year orders like you might associate with the aircraft programs at aeronautics. They tend to be individual fiscal year buys. So because we don't sort of reach forward and get multiple fiscal years in a combined buy, you don't see the increases in backlog that you might experience with Missiles and Fire Control. We do expect through – as you look at the year 2015, we do expect to end the year at higher levels of backlog than we began the year for Missiles and Fire Control by as much as about $1.5 billion. So it's not like it's shrinking. It is growing. It's growing at a clip. But it's not growing leaps and bounds like you would expect to see with a large multiyear program. That's simply not the way those products are typically being bought.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Just want to ask a couple of things on F-35. Since you're still negotiating LRIP 9, how much margin risk is there, given the work that's already been done that you referred to earlier? And then, Marillyn, you talked about the full year, the effect of a full-year CR and how debilitating that would be. But it would be largely a backlog issue in 2016. Are we referring to the slippage of – I think it's 19 F-35s? And at what point will we see that in the P&L, and how would that affect just the production efficiencies?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'll take on the first one, Rob. The F-35 LRIP 9 negotiation and margin risk if this is not done. Rob, I would characterize this as sort of par for the course, typical. I mean this is what we've been going through with F-35 for quite some time. I'll say that the numbers that we talk about for 2016, because there's so little impact of LRIP 9 affecting the P&L in 2016, I wouldn't expect to see a huge swing no matter sort of what we negotiated margin-wise on LRIP 9. And maybe I'll let Marillyn answer the broader CR question, but you asked a specific one about 19 aircraft on the F-35, if there is sort of a full-year continuing resolution. I think that number is about right. That's the number that the Pentagon has talked about. Again, we wouldn't expect to see much of an impact of that affecting 2016. You would start to see that pick up steam in 2017 and 2018 and beyond. I'll remind you we do record revenue and earnings on a cost-to-cost basis as opposed to units of delivery. So, those 19 aircraft would stop having less growth than we had expected to have happen, but not much in 2016. It would start happening in 2017 and beyond.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think you pretty well answered him, Bruce...
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Sam.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Can you talk a little bit about the Space Systems segment, just what drove the better-than-expected sales and earnings? Does this change your view towards how strategic it is to maintain your ULA joint venture? And if I can sneak a second one in, Bruce, can you just tell us is CapEx mostly flat year-over-year as we look at the 2016 free cash? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'll try that, Sam. So, third quarter Space was actually down about 5% in the quarter. We should think of that – we had a commercial launch last year and none this year. That was probably the biggest driver for the reduction. There's a lot of pieces sort of moving around, but that wasn't the biggest reason for the delta.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I was thinking more in terms of the year getting better more than...
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Oh, the year, I'm sorry, for the full year. Yeah, so, we've had – the overall year performance had been very good. We've had extremely good performance on our government satellite contracts, and we actually have had some upticks from an EBIT perspective as well with the F-35 – from the ULA joint venture that your next question asked about. So sort of the combined. We're seeing really, really good performance out of Space Systems on their legacy programs. Think of it as the satellite programs like SBIRS and Advanced EHF. But also on the launch vehicle business with ULA, we're seeing some more equity earnings there. As to the other question on the ULA JV, we haven't decided anything differently about the ULA JV despite what's in the press, Sam, so I'm not going to comment on that at this point in time. And then I think your last question was on CapEx for next year and how we should think of that. You should think of that as being essentially comparable to this year's level, maybe a little bit higher. But I'll tell you every year, as we look out to the next year, people think we're going to spend more in CapEx, and we tend to not do that as we go throughout the year. So, for right now, I'll just say probably pretty comparable to this year's level.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just to ask about the plan – the strategic review, your ability to conclude the strategic review and make a decision about what to do with those businesses, how much is that contingent upon a budget outcome, just having a budget outcome, and then on any particular budget outcome?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. So, Seth, I don't think we see much dependency whatsoever on a budget outcome. I don't – and again, I'll just go back to – if you look at this business and what the projections are for this business, they're sort of unaffected by the budget outcome in terms of continuing resolution and the like because again continuing resolution would put a hindrance on new starts, programs that are growing fiscal year over fiscal year. We don't have a whole lot of that in this business. And I wouldn't expect that to have much of an impact as far as deciding what to do with the businesses on a strategic review as a result of that.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I would just to add to that that we are getting strong expressions of interest from a lot of different parties ranging from strategic buyers to non-strategic buyers. And I think that makes the point that these are high quality assets and it's a very strong business portfolio. So it just reaffirms our belief that this is the kind of business that would benefit from a lower cost structure outside of Lockheed Martin. And we feel very strongly that we'll be able to come to a conclusion by the end of the year on what the path forward is for that element of our business to make it more competitive and stronger in the marketplace.
Jerry F. Kircher - Vice President-Investor Relations: Karen, I think we're coming up on the hour. Maybe I'll – one last question and we'll turn it over to Marillyn for final comments.
Operator: Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC: Bruce, maybe looking to get a little bit of help in terms of how we model things on a go-forward basis. With the outcome of whatever you decide to do with government IT and PS, there will be a fair amount of dilution. Depending on which route you choose and the cash that comes in, would you expect to be able to fairly quickly offset a fair amount of the dilution from potentially selling those businesses or just in terms of how we're modeling this going forward, how should we think about it?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So there's a lot of – depending on the structure, David, there's a lot of just moving pieces that try to predict the outcome there. You should think of a spin as essentially a left pocket, right pocket to our shareholders, right, because the value of the business under a spin would simply be held by the same shareholders that hold Lockheed Martin stock today. So total effect on shareholders is not – should be inconsequential in that view. I understand the dilution if you look at the after-Lockheed Martin, but there is a lot of moving pieces that could affect that. Obviously, the amount of cash that we get back, whether it's a sale, obviously we get back a lot more cash. Whether it's a split or not as part of the spin/merge, there's a lot of different moving pieces there that are just at this point hard to predict. We'll have, I think, a whole lot more fidelity and a whole lot better insight on that when we finally reach a final decision of the outcome or the path for the outcome in December. And again, we're going to communicate that to you just as soon as we get there.
Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So let me just conclude the call today. I want to end by reiterating that the corporation had another solid quarter and we continue to be well-positioned to deliver substantial value to our customers and to our stockholders. We'll continue to progress toward a successful closure for 2015 and as we look ahead in 2016. Thanks again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you on the next earnings call in January. And let me just turn it back over to you, Karen, to conclude our call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.

Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin portfolio shaping actions and second quarter 2015 earnings results conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you, Abigail, and good morning. I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today’s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today’s press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. I would also note that we are extending the call duration till 12:30 today to enable adequate time for your questions on our financial results and strategic actions.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning everyone and thank you all for adjusting your calendars and joining us on the call today. It’s a day earlier than planned, so it’s especially given the short notice we appreciate you joining us.  With today’s press release outlining two strategic actions we are implementing to strengthen our competitive posture and position the corporation for profitable long term growth, we accelerated the call to enable timely discussion of our second quarter financial results and the portfolio shaping items.  Starting with our financial performance, we had a strong quarter operationally and financially, with all reported results exceeding our expectations, and we are progressing on achievement of full year financial objective. These results reflect the execution being achieved across the businesses as the Corporation operated at a very strong level in providing critical solutions to customers while returning value to stockholders.  The year-to-date financial performance also enabled us to again increase full year 2015 guidance for segment and consolidated operating profit and earnings per share. In addition to these increases to guidance, we reaffirmed our earlier outlook for full year orders, sales, and cash from operations. With these strong financial results, we continued to return value to stockholders in the areas of share repurchases and dividend repayments through cash deployment initiatives.  I would now like to discuss the two strategic actions we announced today, and then I’ll ask Bruce to cover in more detail our second quarter financial results and increased 2015 guidance.  To assist our discussion, I would ask you to turn your attention to the charts we provided on our website. Starting on Chart 4, – reshaping our portfolio. The first strategic action we announced is our signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Sikorsky Aircraft. Sikorsky is a natural fit for Lockheed Martin and it complements our broad portfolio of world-class aerospace and defense products and technologies. This action will enable us to extend our core business into the $30 billion annual military and commercial rotary wing segment.  The second major action is the commencement of a strategic review of our government IT infrastructure services work at Information Systems & Global Solutions and of our technical services work at Missiles and Fire Control. The strategic review will address the changing market dynamics affecting these businesses and will help us determine how to best position them for future growth and is expected to result in a spinoff or sale of the businesses. These actions continue our practice of continuously shaping the portfolio to secure the highest value creation for customers and stockholders.  Turning to an overview of Sikorsky on Chart 5. Sikorsky is well known as a world leader in the design, manufacture, and support of military and commercial helicopters. Their international presence is wide-ranging with operations in 20 countries and their products are used in over 40 countries. Sikorsky’s revenue composition is shown on the pie chart with approximately 75% of their work for military customers and the remaining 25% to commercial users. With approximately 50% of their annual revenue derived from international customers, they will aid us in moving forward on our goal to expand international revenues. The acquisition rationale is outlined on Chart 6. Some of the important strategic benefits of this acquisition are that Sikorsky has familiar customers. This familiarity will assist the integration process through utilization of similar knowledge and interaction with common customers. They are also extraordinarily well-positioned with an established brand, and a robust backlog of future work. They also have a 40-year history as a frequent teammate of our mission systems and training business area, and today we collaborate on the VH-92 Presidential helicopter, combat rescue helicopter, and the Naval MH-60 Romeo helicopter.  Their strong aftermarket business is also expected to provide a long-term source of earnings to the Corporation and another lever of value creation. The opportunity to access capital in today’s historically low interest rate environment is another significant contributor to the rationale and value creation of the acquisition.  Beyond the strategic benefits I outlined, another key element of the acquisition rationale is the Section 338(h)(10) tax election for the transaction which is expected to provide approximately $2 billion in net present value for our Corporation and stockholders.  Future growth prospects of the acquisition are outlined on Chart 7. One of the key elements of our strategic planning is to secure and extend our core defense business, and we feel confident that the addition of Sikorsky will contribute significantly to the growth objective. As the prime contractor for multiple current development helicopter programs such as the CH-53K, Presidential, and Combat Rescue, Sikorsky is well-positioned to grow as these programs transition into production scheduled in 2018. With their extensive presence around the world in over 40 countries, we see further expansion of our international operations as we will benefit from their international footprint and customer relationships.  Sikorsky’s footprint in the commercial aviation segment is well-established with the extensive activities supporting the oil and gas industry. While this segment has been under recent pressure due to low oil prices, it is expected to recover in the future and add value to the Corporation. We believe these current pressures enable us to make this acquisition at a low point in the economic cycle. All of these elements indicate significant opportunities for growth in the future and value creation potential.  I’d now like to outline the transaction valuation on Chart 8. The agreement announced today outlined the purchase price of $9 billion and will be funded with a combination of new debt and available cash. It is important to note that our joint election of the 338(h)(10) tax benefit effectively brings the adjusted price of the transaction to slightly over $7 billion with an adjustment multiple of 10.3 times EBITDA. These metrics demonstrate that we are purchasing an active participant in one of the largest areas of DoD expenditures at an attractive price. I also want to reiterate that this transaction will not change our previously outlined plan to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases between 2015 and 2017 and reducing our outstanding share count to below 300 million shares by the end of 2017.  An overview of synergy is shown on Chart 9. While there are multiple elements of synergy that we have identified from this transaction, the largest contribution will be from the approximately $2 billion that we will recognize through the election of the Section 338(h)(10) tax treatment.  In the area of cost synergies, we expect to achieve a steady-state level of around $150 million annually after integration actions are completed. In the area of revenue synergy, we see multiple opportunities by leveraging our relationships with international governments and our ability to match their security needs with a full spectrum of our security offerings. Sikorsky’s products and capabilities will aid to our existing portfolio and enable us to offer an ever broader range of solutions to international customers.  Before leaving Sikorsky, I also want to offer some additional perspectives on our new team members. We have similar cultures. We have a shared passion for innovation and a commitment to supporting the men and women who defend their freedom. Together, we will offer stronger portfolio of helicopter and systems engineering solutions to our global customers as we accelerate the pace of new technology. At the same time, our commitment to bring the best we have to offer to our work with our helicopter manufacturers is absolutely -- with other helicopter manufacturers is absolutely undiminished. I'm confident that Sikorsky will be an excellent fit within our mission systems and training business area and a strong contributor to the Corporation as we move forward together. I will now turn to Chart 10 and speak to the second portfolio action we outlined today. The strategic review of IT and services work in our IS&GS and MFC business areas. Let me start by saying that we have a proud legacy as a world leading government IT services and technical services provider. However market dynamics and trends led us to believe that these businesses may potentially achieve greater growth which is good for our employees and create more value for our customers and stockholders by operating outside of Lockheed Martin. The metrics shown outlines the businesses within IS&GS and MFC that comprise the strategic review, as well as those that will be realigned under other existing business areas.  For your reference, the businesses under strategic review are expected to generate approximately $6 billion in annual revenue this year with mid-7% margin. With the series of recent wins, the businesses under strategic review are well-positioned to generate value under an expected spinoff or sale.  As I summarize today’s announcements on Chart 11, I’d like to conclude by reiterating that the two strategic actions we announced today represent powerful portfolio reshaping activities and provide strong opportunity for creating long-term to shareholders. We believe there are opportunities for significant synergies and are confident that the risk of execution is low. Both of today’s actions will further position the Corporation for growth and value creation for investors and customers.  I’ll now ask Bruce to go through our second-quarter financial performance and our increased 2015 guidance and then we’ll open up the line for questions. 
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning everyone. I will try to keep my remarks brief this morning so as to allow more time for questions during our session and my remarks relate to web charts addressing just the financial results for the quarter.  Beginning with Chart 14, we have an overview of our second-quarter results. Sales for the quarter were $11.6 billion and were ahead of our expectations. We will provide more color on our sales results on the next chart.  Our segment operating margin was also better-than-expected in the quarter at 12% and enabled us to achieve earnings-per-share of $2.94. We generated $1.3 billion in cash from operations, again a little better-than-expected and we will also discuss this further in a few charts.  Our cash deployment actions increased over the first quarter with $1.4 billion of cash returned to shareholders, including nearly 5 million shares repurchased for more than $900 million. And with our strong operational performance, we are increasing your full year outlook for both operating profit and earnings-per-share. So we feel good about how we ended the first half of the year and that positions us well for the remainder of the year. On Chart 15, we compare our second-quarter sales results for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales are higher by about 3% compared with the second quarter of last year and while most of the higher volume in the quarter was due to earlier than planned deliveries, we will be watching this closely over the next few months to see if the higher trend continues.  Chart 16 compares our segment operating margin this quarter with the second quarter of 2014. Segment operating margin was 40 basis points lower this quarter compared with the same period last year but as I said earlier this was higher than we had planned for the quarter and enabled us to increase our margin outlook for the year. Mission systems and training drove the higher-than-expected results with margin improving 250 basis points over the second quarter of last year. Better performance this year combined with the absence of performance issues last year led to this improvement.  Turning to Chart 17, we will compare our earnings-per-share results this quarter with our result from a year ago. Our EPS of $2.94 was 7% higher than the results from last year and enabled us to increase our EPS for the year.  Chart 18 provides details into share repurchase activity during the quarter. As we previously mentioned, we had significantly higher share repurchases in the quarter compared with the same period last year with $937 million spent. More importantly we’re $300 million ahead of the year-to-date amount from a year ago and have reduced shares outstanding by more than 5 million shares and we are well on our way to achieving or exceeding the $2 billion repurchase target we established at the beginning of the year.  On Chart 19 we discuss our total cash return to stockholders for both the quarter and year-to-date with a $1.4 billion in cash returned to stockholders in the second quarter, we returned just over $2.5 billion on a year-to-date basis and in both the quarter and year-to-date we returned 131% of free cash flow to our stockholders.  On Chart 20 we provide our updated outlook for the year. We are leaving both orders and sales unchanged at this time. About 65% of our orders are planned for the second half of the year and while we think there is upside potential in our sales for the second half of the year we will have a much better feel for both of these metrics when we get to the third quarter call. We are increasing our segment operating profit by $75 million due to our strong performance through the first half of the year and as a result of our increasing profit, we are also increasing our earnings-per-share guidance by $0.15 to a new outlook of between $11 and $11.30 per share.  Finally, we are keeping our cash from operations guidance unchanged. We mentioned last quarter that our cash would be significantly weighted for the second half of the year and while that is still the case, our stronger second-quarter results have reduced that difference between the first and second half of the year. On Chart 21, we have our sales outlook by business area. Again no change in our outlook at this time.  Chart 22 shows our outlook for segment operating profit. We have a higher profit outlook in two of our business areas this quarter, increasing Space Systems by $45 million and Mission Systems and Training by $30 million resulting in the total outlook increase of $75 million.  Finally Chart 23 provides our summary of the quarter. We had a good quarter building upon our results from the first quarter and positioning us well as we look forward to the rest of the year. Our cash deployment actions accelerated in the quarter and we remain committed to the actions we discussed earlier this year. Our program execution was very good in the quarter and we look forward to adding to our portfolio with some strategic wins in the second half of the year. And last but certainly not least our decisions to acquire Sikorsky Aircraft and conduct a strategic review of our government IT and technical services business makes this quarter strong from both the tactical and strategic perspective.  And with that, we are ready for your questions. Abigail?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. 
David Strauss : Bruce, can you just give us – potentially give us some more metrics that you are thinking about around Sikorsky, potential leverage that you see, the deleveraging and then how you’re thinking about intangible amortization and accretion from the deal as you look out?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, sure David. So as we look to finance this deal as Marillyn said, we expect to use some cash off the balance sheet but also obviously the vast majority of it in the form of debt. Currently, we are thinking that looks somewhere around $1 billion off of the balance sheet in terms of cash use and $8 billion worth of debt. We think just from sort of -- just to give you a lot of metrics maybe at once here. We think that the debt -- the average coupon for the multiple maturities that we would do, including potentially a little bit of commercial paper in the mix, would be about a 3.5% coupon. So you should think of that as somewhere in the order of $280-ish million a year of interest and on an aftertax basis something like $180 million a year rounding.  Intangible amortization, I think was your other question. As we look at this right now, we’re probably looking at about $3.5 billion worth of intangible costs, think of that as sort of trade name, customer relationships as the biggest drivers of that intangible level, and that would equate to about $250 million of expense a year. So again think of the $180 million after-tax interest, intangible amortization around $215 million a year. Then on the positive side, obviously the 338(h)(10), as Marillyn said, almost $2 billion worth of present value, you should think of that as being about $450 million a year sort of tax deduction associated with the step-up in assets that equates to about $160 million a year benefit going forward. And then as Marillyn said also, we’re expecting somewhere in a steady-state run rate of about $150 million a year in additional earnings. So if you add all those up together, a lot of moving pieces there, I realize that your final question was sort of accretion and when does that happen. So our intent is to integrate this business as quickly as possible. Marillyn said, we expect to close somewhere in the end of 2016 or excuse me, end of 2015, early 2016. So we would expect to have the integration cost spent in large part in 2016. We want to get the integration done as quickly as possible in order to generate the synergies that come from that. So we would be GAAP dilutive, if you will, in 2016. We expect to be marginally GAAP accretive from an earnings perspective starting in 2017, and then to grow from that point forward. Just one, maybe last comment on the – that’s okay. I will leave it there and see if there is another question on it. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.
Finbar Sheehy : It’s Finbar Sheehy for Doug. Turning to the other side of your strategic announcement this morning on the services and IT businesses, can you talk a little more about the criteria you’ll use to decide which ones you will keep and which ones you will divest? And as you talk about that, you mentioned that you have the opportunity to acquire Sikorsky at the bottom of the cycle and some of these IT and services businesses have been hurt by the budget controlled active sequestration. So how do you avoid, if you like, divesting these businesses at the bottom of their market? 
Marillyn Hewson: So just to speak to the portfolio, the way that we’ve gone at, we’ve been looking at our IT infrastructure services and technical services business for some time now, and then quite a bit of analysis trying inside the Corporation to figure out how we can make it as competitive as we can. As you know, there is a lot more competitors that have come into the marketplace and our customers’ priorities are changing in what they're looking at more – they’re much more price-sensitive and so the elements of our business predominantly will be in the work that we're doing for civil agencies, IT-infrastructure type services.  Well if you can think about enterprise IT services that are done for various agencies, that is the type of work that we fall into this and then the technical services work that has been our Missiles and Fire Control business. In terms of -- we certainly want to create value through this process. So what we believe is if we move it out from under the business structure in Lockheed Martin, that will allow us to thrive and grow –will allow us to have a business structure that allows it to thrive and grow, and so we are willing to separate those businesses to create that value going forward. We think it's a very strong business, we have a strong legacy of being the top IT provider for the US government for the past 21 years, and this is a business that has strong performance and strong programs, and we’ve had some recent wins this year and we’ve had some acquisitions in that business. So we think what we have is a premier asset, and we think if we can stand it up as a standalone company or if it’s attractive to buyout when we can get the right price for it, that’s the best for that business to go forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran : Marillyn, Bruce, I wanted to know if you think you could be a better owner and operator of Sikorsky than United Technologies was. If possible, I'd like to know on how you might be looking at operating the business differently than UTX did, how you might think that might be a benefit?
Marillyn Hewson: Well I will start out first and then Bruce, you can add to my comments. I think if you look at what is our core business, our core business is doing business with governments and its platform and systems integration. So that is the predominance of our business and I think in that sense bringing Sikorsky into our business is just a natural fit for us and it’s ability for us to bring or strengthen and running programs and government contracting and all of that expertise through the Sikorsky business. We also look forward to the opportunity to create value on the international side of our business from their footprint that they have around the world and the work that they're doing in a number of countries. So I think if you look at the potential synergies, we do think we are an excellent owner and a better owner for this business because not only do we bring our expertise, they’re bringing in their footprint and their capability around the world has value that we can create as well. Bruce, do you want to add some –
Bruce Tanner: Just a thought, Rich, so in terms of adding value greater than the parent, this is a business that’s been successful for however long it’s been in business, 90 something plus years. So they obviously are a national icon in terms of the capabilities that they bring to the rotary marketplace. So they do a lot of things well already. Where I think we can create value, I mean first off, we think this deal has pretty low execution risk from us. I mean I’d like to think of this as we’re buying a portfolio of programs versus sort of a new business model and new marketplaces and new customers that we've never dealt with before. This is all very very familiar with us and I’d like to think of this as having sort of a power and backing of a $45 million business focused on government contracting versus one which was less focused perhaps in total than just on the piece of the Sikorsky business. I do think there are areas we can improve the business, particularly on the contracting side and maybe the focus a little bit on the cash flow side. I think in particular the international sales market is an interesting one for us where we – through the combination of our portfolios coming in having a discussion about the security needs of our international customers whether it’s F-35 Littoral Combat Ships, now Sikorsky helicopters is a much much more powerful discussion than what I believe the current parent could have in terms of bundling products and services together to go into the international marketplace.  So I think all of those really add to our ability to help us better position this business going forward. We’re happy to have this business. We think it fits well into our portfolio and this is what we do, and this is our core knitting. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton : Marillyn, have you had a chance to get initial feedback from the DoD in the proposed acquisition particularly as it applies to broader consolidation in the industrial base realizing the Army is not a huge customer proportionally to Lockheed Martin, maybe that’s not as much but at the DoD there may be some issue?
Marillyn Hewson: Well as we would do on any acquisition we contacted our customers. So I got an opportunity to speak with senior levels in the Department of Defense and have offered to them to provide whatever additional information they needed, they assessed it. They have been consistent through any acquisition of this type to say that they will assess and ask their questions and give it a detailed review, and so we stand ready to support them through that process. I do think if you look at this acquisition we are not reducing the number of competitors at all in this segment, in the helicopter segment. And so in that sense – there shouldn’t be a concern and our portfolio is very complementary. There is very little overlap between our two portfolios. So in that sense, that I will expect that, that would not be a concern of theirs going forward.  In terms of the services business, there are many, many competitors out in the IT services arena. So the fact that we are trying to position this business where it can be more competitive in that arena, I think they would view this positively. So between those two elements, it’s very positive. The other thing that our view is -- there's some concern about consolidation making one entity bigger than another, when you look at these two strategic actions that we’re taking, UTC has reported that they see the sales for Sikorsky to be $6.5 billion this year in 2015 and the piece of business that we are looking at during a strategic review to spin or sell was about $6 billion. So we may find at the end of the day that we are roughly the same size, maybe even a little smaller, maybe a little bigger but basically roughly the same size with both of these strategic actions. So I don’t think there is more concentration at Lockheed Martin in that sense.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Rob Spingarn : Just two quick clarification questions. One on what Marillyn just spoke of but with regard to the strategic evaluation at IT, the question there is you’re talking about this as a single $6 billion business, or at least that’s my interpretation. Bt might you consider doing different things with different pieces selling some and spinning the other? And then for Bruce, is the $150 million in synergies net of things like profit on profit?
Marillyn Hewson: So to your question, first of all, this could be – there is a number of possible scenarios. That’s why we want to go through this process between now and the end of the year to really give a strategic review on what is the best option -- strategic options for these elements of the business. To your point it could result in one or more transactions and our key is how do we deliver more value to our customers, how do we deliver more value to our shareholders through this process. The strategic review has got to determine what the ultimate outcome and it could be more than one transactions. 
Bruce Tanner: Rob, the second part of your question, $150 million steady state going forward, that is considered to be net of fee on fee or profit on profit if you will, just to give you – not to confuse your perhaps but just to give you some insight. The level of sales that we see, the overlap that would need to be adjusted out, if you will, once Sikorsky becomes part of the portfolio for our business that’s being conducted within mission systems and training. You should think of that being about $150 million a year. I mean there is obviously price business right now that carries on for some period of time for things like our work on the combat rescue helicopter or the Presidential helicopter, that wouldn’t have a negative profit impact in the near-term but we eliminate the sales obviously of that going forward. And then so sneak – think of them when we get to the steady state, that is net if you will of that consideration of fee on fee. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.
Pete Skibitski : Congrats, guys, on some bold moves. Guys, how do you think about the strategic fit of Sikorsky’s commercial helicopter business? 
Marillyn Hewson: Well, I think for us it’s a nice bid in the sense that as I mentioned in my remarks at the outset, it’s predominantly in the oil and gas side which is not an area that we are in. And while we’ve got some near-term pressure there just because of what’s happened with oil prices, we see an opportunity in a few years for that to turn and so real opportunity for growth there as we move forward. And then the other side would be -- on the commercial side would be on the sustainment. There is commercial aircraft that are already in the base among these 40 countries that I mentioned have to be maintained and sustained, so that’s a good strong healthy business.  When you look at it from a Lockheed Martin standpoint, I mean we sell our products and services to heads of countries, so they buy both military and commercial platforms and systems and sustainment activities, so I think that that is a nice fit where we bring all of that together in our customer relationships around the world. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro : Yes, Bruce, I just want a little more clarification. You have commented about Sikorsky. So you're saying in terms of the profit on profit that you're going to be getting for the programs as if you’re subcontractor to Sikorsky, that's about $150 million currently or that's what it's going to be? 
Bruce Tanner: No, George, that was revenue. Profits are a much, much smaller number. 
George Shapiro : Okay. And that's because a lot of their programs that you're a subcontracted to really haven't started to ramp up yet. 
Bruce Tanner: That’s correct, George but I will tell you the absolute dollars on our side don’t deviate a whole lot from that number for the work that we are doing today and for the near future. 
George Shapiro : And then similar subject, Bruce, how much subcontract work do you do for other helicopter manufacturers that might be at risk since they may not want to deal with a competitor? 
Bruce Tanner: So we do quite a bit of work, George, actually as we sell direct to the US government, a lot of the work is not directly to the helo manufacturer themselves. So a lot of our integration activities is actually done direct to the government as opposed to direct to the other helo manufacturers if you will. We have relationships with everyone domestically and internationally in the helo marketplace. Our intention is to maintain those relationships going forward That's something that we would obviously have to consider relative to our discussions with the DoD as far as going forward this incorporation of the business, and that’s something that we would intend to do just out of a pure economics perfect nothing else, but that’s just right thing for us to do going forward. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Rubel : Hi, thank you. I'm going to turn to the boring things of talking about the business for a moment, Marillyn. You had a couple of nice positive developments in terms of operations. Were there some things that you could address both in space and, frankly, in aircraft that either you brought to bear to change the profit trajectory? 
Marillyn Hewson: Well this is B2 our major program, BF-35, we’ve made really good progress over the past quarter on that program. I had the opportunity to attend the CEO conference in Norway for the F-35 program, we are all international partners participate in that secretary, candle and we have strong support for the program itself and the fact that secretary kindle after that to discuss a potential block buy for the program which would be for at least 450 to maybe 500 aircraft in FY8, FY120 we are the strong statement about the tortoise of the game and the outlook for the program forward. If you think on that, if you been tracking the performance in program toward the marine corps initial operating capability, the marines have finished their operationally readiness, they are now in the midst of their assessment of their operational readiness and is on track. They appear to be on track to announce their IOC this month and we look forward to that. That’s a huge milestone, this program – there is first service to come to declare that aircraft combat ready I think send a strong message to everyone that this program is on track. We delivered 11 aircraft in the second quarter, we’re on track to deliver 45 in 2015 and we’ve gotten long lead for LRIP 10, so that’s for 94 aircraft. So program is ramping up in that sense. I think it’s well supported in a budget proposals that are out there. So in that sense production is ramping up, software completion and all those things are on track and so that’s what I would say on the 35. You mentioned the space program, I mean they are performing well on our government satellites and NEOs, for example, just launch the third NEO satellite and that program is moving forward and then you’ve seen the reports out that we have put forward a more cost effectives approach going forward and was greatly embraced by US government on diversions. So we will continue our path along them.  And then in the missile defense arena, I hope you saw that Germany has announced their intent to – they selected MEADS for their air defense system and that’s truly a strategic win for us. I mean legacy systems are aging and they need replacement, they went through a very thorough assessment of what system would best fit their needs and they selected MEADS and I think it sets the tone for other countries, we will be looking at this important selection by Germany and we expect other countries to look at MEADS as their choice for the most modern and most capable missile defense system for their countries. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.
Joseph DeNardi : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Bruce, I'm wondering if you could talk about -- I guess it may be tough to talk about -- but the proceeds from the spin or the sale at this point, is that additive to your capital deployment plans or should we think about that as going towards the balance sheet? 
Bruce Tanner: So you are right, it is hard to predict, I mean those are obviously two completely different scenarios in terms of the cash that we would receive from that versus spin versus a sale. Spin obviously being a lot less, we’ve got a fairly low tax basis in that business, at least as we look at it, not unlike what UTC was probably looking with Sikorsky, now you’ve got a low tax basis, so your ability to get cash out on the spin basis is limited from a tax free basis – or tax free perspective to what that is in terms of the tax-free dividend. So we get a lot more cash back from a sale perspective. I hate to speculate what that could be and we will get into further detail as we get into the latter part of this year and early part of next year as far as when we sort of close on our decision as to which path we go down. I would suspect in terms of cash deployment, the near term cash deployment would probably be paying off, some of that I mentioned as far as some of the debt that we are doing to do the Sikorsky deal would likely come in the form of commercial paper. We’d probably pay that off pretty frequently and bring debt down, and then the rest, Joseph, we will wait and see what we’ve got and what needs we have at that time and as usual try to be opportunistic in all our cash deployment actions as we always are.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee CRT.
Peter Arment : Yes, thank you. Congratulations, Marillyn and Bruce. I want a clarification. Sikorsky, will that be an independent segment or are you going to have it on a standalone basis or will it be folded in as part of aeronautics or one of the other segments? And then if you could also give us, Bruce, just regarding the quarter, Marillyn mentioned that you're going to be delivering 45 F-35s this year. Can you give us a run down or just kind of the planning for deliveries for this year and maybe a sneak peak on how that looks for next year? Thanks.
Marillyn Hewson: In terms of Sikorsky, our intent is for that business to report directly into mission systems and training. That’s our business where Dale Bennett is the executive vice president, so he will be a director for a line of business in that business and we intend to maintain its name and its brand, so we will preserve that brand identity, we think it is very strong for Sikorsky and so we will continue forward with that. So whether it will be Sikorsky or Lockheed Martin company, we will report into mission systems and training. Now our plan is to move forward. Bruce?
Bruce Tanner: So Peter, just talk about deliveries, as you said 45 this year, that’s about what we are expecting to have for the year. I think we’ve delivered 19 year to date basis, so obviously that ramp rate picks up in the second half of the year. Just going down the entire portfolio, the C-130, again we talked in the past about that being a very steady build rate of about 24 aircraft a year. We had 10 deliveries in the first half of the year which would obviously imply 14 in the second half. Right now those are more weighted just for FYI purposes towards the fourth quarter than they are for the third quarter. I’d like to think there is some potential to move some of those aircraft into the third quarter although that’s actually making our sales if we just were to profile our sales for the rest of the year, it makes our fourth quarter look a little bit bigger than I think it actually is going to be as we sit here today. C-5 deliveries, we have expected about 9 for the year, we had 5 on a year to date basis. So 4, for the rest of the year, unless we pull in one for next year, and these aircraft are getting to be a very good pattern from a performance perspective. We were actually earlier on the deliveries all throughout the first half of this year. So we are going to be watching that but that’s not within our current plan, it’s not within our current guidance.  Next year, I don’t have the numbers off the top of my head, Peter but definitely the aircraft deliveries on F-35 are going up. I am sorry, let me back up for a second. I didn’t talk F-16, I apologize. F-16, 11, 12 aircraft in the year, we did 6 in the first half of the year, 5, 6 in the second half. So let me maybe start with the easy ones. C-130J, 24 next year, F-16 similar levels of sales in terms of quantities next year. F-35, greater than the 45, now I don’t have that number off the top of my head but it’s a pretty good increase, Peter, from what I’ve got in my memory there. And then C-5s a very similar number to what we are seeing in 2015. Hopefully that helps with the question now. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with BofA Merrill Lynch.
Ron Epstein : Hey, good morning, guys. If you could just quickly go through, if possible, in a little more detail where you expect to pick up the $150 million of cost synergies. Are you going to be moving facilities, is it just back office take out? How are you thinking about that, Bruce?
Bruce Tanner: So it’s a combination of probably all the things that you would think would happen in this sort of transaction. So some of the bigger abilities to – so we believe get some long term synergies are in the supply chain particularly with the overlap of the procurement activities, especially within our aeronautics business activities but also within MST as well in terms of systems overlap there. So you should think of the synergies coming in the form of supply chain synergies, a little bit of facilities perhaps rationalization and some headcount rationalization as you would expect as well. And collectively that adds up to more than 150, we think the 150 is sort of what sticks to the bottom line after consideration of price business and disclosing under cost and pricing data on our government business. The thing that interested me or that caught my attention when we looked at this business is more of it stays with us longer term, I think because this probably has a longer tail of price business than I would have expected before we went into the diligence phase. I mean about $16 billion worth of price business, so obviously you get to keep it on that part of the business and also the commercial and the sustainment particularly on the supply chain savings, the headcount savings and the like, obviously those are less cost base driven in terms of pricing and more of the synergy you get from a cost side there stay for longer as well. So that’s how I think about those three buckets facilities, supply chain, headcount and for the reasons I just said they stay with us for longer than you might otherwise think. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. 
Hunter Keay : Thanks for taking my question. As we think about the evolution of Lockheed here over the next 12 months, how should we think about how IRAD will maybe move around a little bit, getting rid of some of the short-cycle stuff, and laying in Sikorsky already in a little bit of an upward trajectory year over year. Should we think about maybe R&D trending at or above the 2% of sales level once everything gets done with? 
Bruce Tanner: So I will take that, Hunter. So it’s an interesting swap. Marillyn talked earlier about a sort of big picture perspective where we are losing $6 billion worth of business on our IT tech services side which you should think of being much much, much significantly lower IRAD intensive than the rest of the business, and this I think speaks to the need for that business to have as cost efficient structure as is possible in order to survive in the environment that we are currently operating in there. Sikorsky operates in a much more IRAD intensive environment but not unlike what the rest of the portfolio of Lockheed Martin looks like when you exclude the IS&GS and the tech services piece. So I can actually try to do some quick math myself, Hunter, I think we get close to 2% or so of R&D when you kind of get to the new sales level of the combined company minus that which is spun or sold and you add in the IRAD for all the remaining businesses plus Sikorsky, it’s actually probably a little bit north of 2%. 
Operator: Thank you. Our question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. 
Robert Stallard : Bruce, you mentioned there was some franchise wins you were looking to achieve in the second half of this year. I was wondering if you could give us an update on those and which ones you think your chance are best at. 
Bruce Tanner: Sure, Rob. So when I talked franchise wins in the second half of the year, I am really talking the long range strike bomber and JLTV. We are watching as are our partners, I am certain Boeing watching very closely, the expectation that, that will probably be decided sometime in the August, September timeframe. We still like our offering there and we feel good about that. We’ve had lots of discussions, I think we are good partners for each other, we bring very very capable collaborative skill sets to the fray. And so that’s the first one that we are looking at, Rob and again I think we like where we sit there.  JLTV is the other one. JLTV is maybe in some people’s views a little bit tougher putt because they don’t necessarily associate Lockheed Martin with being in the combat vehicle business but I think we’ve got a tremendous offering there. And it would put us into a new segment within the DoD that we don’t have a lot of business, other than sort of putting some of our weapon systems on top of combat vehicle. This would be actually building the contract of the combat vehicle itself. So it’s sort of exciting to be able to have that opportunity. Again we think we’ve got a great offering. They look different in terms of the orders this year, the bomber would be a bigger order, initially the JLTV would be a much, much smaller order initially in the current year. Both of them have very long, think of as decades long sort of production track once you get past the development side.  In terms of just sheer dollars that we are looking for, not so much in the franchise wins, that we’ve got big dollars associated with primarily two aeronautics programs that we are needing to close and definitize those contracts on finally the C-130J multi-year and 9 for the F-35 program, both of those are big dollars in the second half of the year in terms of orders. As I still sort of look out for the rest of the year, even though we are light, and I know there was an earlier question about where we are sort of in orders from a year to date basis, but I still think we are marching towards about the $80 billion that we set at the start of the year given all the puts and takes we see going forward. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr : Yes thank you and congratulations on the Sikorsky transaction. So a question, I was surprised that you only have 150 million of intercompany sales given your participation on the CRH Naval Hawk, Presidential and combat and rescue. So could you give us a sense as to where that number goes in the future, and then maybe give us two sort of nitty questions on what the cash flow of Sikorsky looks like given they have a very heavy near term development mix and whether you expect to use contract liability amortization for accounting of the Canadian maritime helicopter?
Bruce Tanner: What a mouthful, Cai. You've got your money's worth to say the least. So yes, we're talking back to the $150 million of intercompany – it’s not quite intercompany yet. I will remind you of that. But that's primarily for the combat rescue helicopter and the Presidential helicopter. That's about -- you shouldn't think of that as this is starting off low and it's going to grow to some larger number, that’s a fairly consistent number. I'm trying to do this from recall, but that’s a consistent number going out every year not just the near-term but the long-term as well. I think maybe where some of the confusion is on the MH 60 helo, that’s the Romeo work that we do there, and there we sort of think of as co-primes on that. We do not subcontract under Sikorsky for that work. That is actually two prime contracts. So that may be where some of the confusion is. So think of this again, as CRH and the Presidential helicopter are VXX related. And those just aren't as large maybe as people think they are in terms of our size of the business there.  Cash flow for Sikorsky I think you hit it right. I think at least for a couple of years, you should think of them adding some inventory buildup. And by the way, I shouldn't get into disclosing going forward Sikorsky sales but what I'm expecting to see is inventory buildup, some working capital buildup for some of the new programs that I just talked about, both the combat rescue helicopter and the presidential helicopter. I know they've also got a loss contract on the Canadian maritime helicopter contract which obviously can't be strong for cash flow. So I wouldn't expect near-term cash to just knock our socks off. I mean this is a long-term business, we're not buying this business for the next three years, we are buying this business for the next three decades in that very much the way that we look at in terms of a long-term acquisition cycle for us.  I think your last question was you asked about the accounting treatment on the Canadian helicopter. We will go with the convention of Lockheed Martin, I mean this will all get settled out in the conforming accounting, in the purchase accounting adjustments and, whatever loss we think is there will be reflected at the time of the acquisition, and that will be reflected behind us if you will, and essentially zero going forward from an accounting perspective. 
Marillyn Hewson : I’ll just add, the structure that we have as I said we are going to integrate the Sikorsky business into mission systems and training, that will be a standalone line of business and we like that model. We like that kind of a co-prime model like we have on MH-60 Romeo as a good approach going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities.
Sam Pearlstein : I'm going to see if I can sneak two in also. The first one is just, Bruce, can you talk about what the cost will be to extract that $150 million in savings, especially in 2016? And then, secondly, on the IT side, I just wanted to understand what's changed. It seems like some of the areas, like commercial cyber, you were still making acquisitions last year. You made healthcare IT Systems Made Simple acquisition late last year. Is it have to do with Sikorsky that you are now looking at other parts of the portfolio, or did something else change about the business that forces it now? 
Bruce Tanner: So Sam, let me try the first one. And I may take a shot at the second one, but Marillyn correct me later on. So the cost to extract in 2016, if we close the deal at the end of this year, obviously I'd like to think of the cost here as sort of transaction costs, integration costs, you've got the intangible amortization, you got interest on net debt. I think I've talked most of those but I haven't necessarily talked the integration costs. So, if the deal gets closed by the end of this year, obviously hopefully most of the transaction costs will be behind us in 2015 whenever it does close ‘15, or ‘16 that's when the bulk of the transaction costs will hit. As I said earlier, we intend to rapidly integrate Sikorsky into our business that would require some acceleration maybe from what you're thinking in terms of the integration costs. I don't know that we've got those totally nailed down at this point in time, Sam but you should think of those 80, $100 million a year kind of level in 2016 as just the integration costs there. Again hopefully it gets that behind us, gets them integrated and enables us to have the synergy impacts having that much quicker.  The second question as far as the IT and what’s changed. You know, it's funny I think as you continually go through a process of competing for new business, even after we acquired some of the companies we acquired, for instance, SMS, some of the new competition that SMS were competing for, we saw some different acts on the behalf of some of our customers than we had been expecting. Things like splitting out parts of the contract, things like splitting out procured costs from the contract that frankly were another sort of twist to that business going forward that was sort of a culmination over a number of years of how that business, and the dynamics of that business has changed.  You know when Sikorksy became available, and when we looked at that and said that’s the business that's probably more down the middle of what the rest of the Corporation is, frankly we didn't think again just to reiterate what Marillyn said that we could necessarily compete in the environment and with the sorts of expectations that customers had in the IT and government services business successfully. And in the interest of creating value for the Corporation and actually giving our employees the greatest chance for growth in the business that they love. That's the reason for the separation. So I’d say it's not one or the other, it’s probably the combination of the two that led to that. 
Marillyn Hewson: The other thing that I would add to that is we’ve looked at -- what we're putting under strategic review we've looked at very closely relative to the rest of what’s in IS&GS for example, and recognize that what we're putting under strategic review is work that is just increasingly difficult for us to be competitive in, and under our standard business model it’s not, I mean the work that they are doing is good work for our customers, it’s important work that they are doing every day, that it's just our standard business model, it's difficult for us to compete. And then the commercial cyber would be an example in what area it operates in. We are not exiting the cyber security business that we do for the US government and for governments around the world. That's an important element of business, it’s an element that we bring a value to, it’s with our robust multilayer cyber defense capability, and we provide some of the most advanced cyber security solutions.  So, in that regard, we are staying in those businesses that we think really fit well with – that it's our core market, and that we can be competitive in much of the business that we are looking at or all of the business that we are looking at putting a strategic review has become extremely price-sensitive. And our customers will – we may be performing at the top of the heap on the work we're doing. But if somebody comes in with a lower price and then re-compete, they will move to a new player, a new untested player. And that's just the environment we are operating in. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.
Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Good morning. As you guys have mentioned, Sikorsky is one in a number of key DoD programs that should support sales growth in the future. But maybe and I know this might be a little difficult to do -- but if you could just lay out a back of the envelope trajectory because you do have those new programs but at the same time you have some pressure on legacy programs and a new multi-year contract coming up on Black Hawk. So maybe the trajectory over the next few years from an earnings standpoint, where things kind of bottom out and then how the drivers come in to push that up as we head into the end of the decade? 
Bruce Tanner: Seth, welcome to the call by the way. Just a couple of thoughts there and I will probably talk more top line and say – and lets you figure out maybe what’s happening on the bottom line there. But top line, in terms of sort of valuation, the way we look at this business and as I mentioned before, the commercial helo market associated with the oil and gas industry is really not just for Sikorsky business but for the market at large has really gone down quite a bit. So from where the peak in 2014 of sales to where we expect going forward, we think that number is going to drop just on the commercial sales, I don’t have these numbers exactly committed to memory but I think they did $1.5 billion or so worth of commercial helo work in 2014 or so. I don’t know what the expectation is in ’15 off the top of my head but I do know in the valuation that we put going forward, we think that number comes closer to sort of $0.75 billion worth of business, that’s our view. So you should think of that as creating some top line pressure at least in our view on the current level of revenue from ’16 going forward for a couple of years, and the commercial market obviously is the more profitable market as well. So that puts pressure on the bottom line there.  Where we see that starting to turn around is some trickling of the commercial market getting better and the oil and gas market getting better, say in the late ’18, ’19 timeframe and that’s also coincidentally when we see the transition from a lot of these developmental firms into production, particularly the 53K, so that’s when we would expect to see sort of a rebound on the other side both from a top line as well as the bottom line and the margins kind of sort out the way that they will depending on the commercial market but that’s just the way we should be in our judgement. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.
David Strauss : Thanks for taking my question again. Bruce and Marillyn, you've talked about this Sikorsky deal, seen as relatively low execution risk. But obviously Sikorsky has run into some problems with CMH, with 53K. Can you just talk about your comfort with the execution risk that you are taking on here? 
Marillyn Hewson: So I would say as Bruce commented earlier, I mean we run government programs, we run platform and systems programs across our entity. I have never seen our company performing better in terms of how – of the programs that we are operating on today and so in that sense, similarly Sikorsky has a long track record of success and in new development programs there are times when any company, if it’s the complexity of it is going – we are going to have some challenges on the front end but I think we bring to this strong program management expertise and coupling that with Sikorsky performance and their innovative technology, that’s where we think this is a low risk. I mean it is right in our core market, we know how to build, we both design and build platforms and so it fits right in our sweet spot. 
Bruce Tanner: The only thing I would add, David, is this is nothing new. I mean what I believe – I am not there on the ground obviously but there is no technical show stoppers that we saw, this is just a hardcore fact of going from development into production. We have all companies probably emphasized with that more than anyone else on the planet probably. But it’s how you look at what we have done in our history, where we are finally on the F-35 program going from development to production, where we have taken the fad from an infant position of trying to figure out this hit to kill air missile defense at the levels we are talking about actually work or not, to where it’s now a production fielded facility or application, just taking the PAC 3 missile to its next generation of the MSC, taking satellites, MUOS advanced DHF, SBIRS from development to production, we’ve got the scars, we know what this is like, so this is not a surprise to us and look, we think when we get Sikorsky into the fold, we are people who’ve sort of been through this a lot of different ways, who can help with that process and we have really, really good production people and not to say that Sikorsky does not, because we are very impressed by the production team there, now we think we have some synergies coming out there as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton : Thanks. Just a follow-up on the overall long term. You mentioned you're buying over three decades. You're on the joint multi-role helo effort today with Bell, and then Sikorsky is on the team with Boeing. Is there anything, when the companies are combined, that's going to preclude you from being on both teams, or is this effectively improving your odds obviously? 
Marillyn Hewson: Well our intention is to the relationships that we have today on those programs. We have – we want to bring the best solution to our customers, we have some good partnerships that we are working on, we intend to continue those partnerships going forward. 
Bruce Tanner: Myles, the other thing I would add is that program, especially the JLTV – the future vertical lift, not JLTV. Future vertical lift is so far out in the future, you tell me when it’s going to happen, the quantities and so forth, there is a lot of chance between now and then for people to change ideas, thoughts, requirements et cetera. So whether that ends up being the program that we think it is today or not, is anyone’s guess. And so it’s hard for me to get just too excited about where we sit today with something that’s probably not going to come at the full rate production for 15 or 20 years. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro : Bruce, on the F-35, was there a margin pick up there? Because you mentioned that you had $30 million higher profit on about $280 million in sales, which obviously would be a higher margin than what you're currently booking on that program. 
Bruce Tanner: Yes, George there was. This is a second straight quarter where we’ve grown up booking rate on some of our LRIP contracts. I think this is just recognizing the progression we are going through, I believe this one – I am trying to think, recall from memory, George, I believe this was on LRIB 6 and you should think of that as being associated with the completion of deliveries over this period of time. So we are starting to get a cadence there. I like to think, I mean I think 6 is on an uptick, was on an uptick, I think 7 is also on uptick, we need to see that cadence sort of continue going forward but I feel really good about where we are on the production, back to my earlier comment going from transitioning from development firms to production we are right there and I think we are doing pretty well on that right now.
George Shapiro : And on the C-5, Bruce, you've been booking near zero with your comment that deliveries seem to be running a little better than expected. What's the outlook for getting better profitability on that program? 
Bruce Tanner: So George, we have a planned step up in the second half of the year reflecting the good performance that we are seeing today. I hope that, that’s something that we are going to actually do better even than what we had planned in the outlook there. And I know you and I have talked specifically, George, about the potentiality of a claim associated with the over and above work we have on the C-5 program, that’s still just to be clear, it’s still not considered within anything that I have talked about at this point in time. And again that’s something we feel very very strongly about in terms of entitlement and we will see how that plays out down the road but that’s not a factor in anything that I just said earlier. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with BofA Merrill Lynch.
Ron Epstein : Bruce, just a real quick accounting question for you. The $2 billion in tax savings that you guys get, is that just straight line over 15 years? 
Bruce Tanner: It is, Ron. It’s a high degree of certainty, because the tax benefits can be used for the combined company. So those are take them home, I mean those are benefits that are going to accrue the corporation. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.
Peter Skibitski : I'm going to miss this, guys, but with all the puts and takes on the Sikorsky deal, are you expecting it to be free cash flow accretive in 2016? 
Bruce Tanner: Yes, it’s going to be a little bit neutral is probably the way I would describe it in 2016 as our expectation, Pete and then we’ll probably get plenty of time to start talking about the years thereafter but I think for near term purposes and like obviously some of that depends on whether it happens at the end of this year, early next year, little bit later but I think if it were for the whole year we think of it as being fairly neutral for us next year.  End of Q&A
Operator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to management for further remarks. 
Marillyn Hewson: Thank you. Well let me just conclude. I appreciate all of you being on the today and I will just conclude by saying we had a strong quarter of financial results and the strategic actions that we’ve announced are expected to position the corporation to deliver even higher value to our customers and stockholders in the future. So thanks again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you in October in our next earnings call. Abigail, that concludes our call today. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today’s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today’s press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call today. We are pleased to have you join us to review our first quarter results. As today’s release outlined, we had another solid quarter operationally and financially. The corporation continues to deliver critical solutions and products to our customers, while also returning value to our stockholders. I am extraordinarily proud of the efforts and focus of our team and their significant accomplishments across the corporation. And looking at the results for the quarter, we achieved or exceeded our expectations. I am very pleased that strong year-to-date financial performance across multiple business areas enables us to increase 2015 full year guidance for operating profit and earnings per share. In addition to these increases to guidance, we reaffirmed our earlier outlook for full year orders, sales and cash from operations. In addition to these solid financial results, we have continued to return value to stockholders in the areas of share repurchases and dividend payments through our cash deployment initiatives. In the quarter, we repurchased over $600 million of our shares and remain committed to achieving the goal we outlined earlier this year to repurchase at least $2 billion of our shares in 2015 market conditions permitting. This ongoing repurchase program enables us to progress on our related goal of reducing total outstanding share count to below 300 million shares by the end of 2017. These repurchases combined with our quarterly dividend repayment returned over $1.1 billion in cash to stockholders this quarter. Turning briefly to DoD budgets, in early February, the President released his proposed fiscal year 2016 base defense budget at $534 billion, reflecting a request with $35 billion more than the spending limits established in the Budget Control Act. The President also proposed an additional $51 billion in spending for overseas contingency operations, or OCO. Combined, the two proposed spending packages totaled $585 billion and if enacted represent a significant increase in total funding for defense above prior year levels. In March, budget resolutions were passed by both houses of Congress that outlined total defense spending level that equals or slightly exceeds the amount requested by the President. The congressional resolutions are a bipartisan recognition of the need for greater investment in defense spending to respond to increasing global security threats, aging military assets and the imperative to improve the readiness of our Armed Forces. The resolutions left in place, the Budget Control Act sequestration cuts to the Defense Department space budget, while increasing funding for the OCO, overseas contingency operations. This approach is intended to enable utilization of funds from the OCO to pay for other defense items outside the normally restricted war-related costs specified in the OCO. While it is too early to predict the final level of FY ‘16 defense budgets, it is encouraging that the President and Congress are aligned in their recognition of the need to increase defense spending from the recent constrained levels. We look forward to finalization of congressional budget deliberations which are expected to be completed later this year. Moving outside the DoD budgets, momentum continues to build with respect to our strategy to expand international business and the success of this strategy remains a priority to me and the corporation. This past quarter, I had the opportunity to travel to multiple countries in Europe and the Middle East to participate in wide ranging discussions on our spectrum of products and services and the increasingly complex geopolitical environment, which requires proven and adaptive solutions at home and abroad. In Europe, I had the opportunity to participate in the Munich Security Conference on international security policy. This meeting included extensive discussions on current and future security challenges and included attendees from more than 70 countries who exchanged views on defense requirements. Well, in the Middle East, I was able to travel to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates where I met with senior government leaders who discussed these current and future regional security issues they face and how we might work with them to address their requirements. These discussions reinforced my belief that our international growth strategy is sound and working. There is an acute need on the part of international customers for an increasingly wide range of our products and services as the geopolitical environment becomes more complex and less predictable. These expanding requirements further position the corporation to achieve our goal of generating at least 25% of annual sales from international customers in the next few years. I would like to move to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and provide a brief summary on the progress of the program that we are achieving and reaching key milestones and securing new business from international customers. Recent production milestone accomplishments included rollout of the first F-35A aircraft from the final assembly and check out facility in Italy. This represents the first time an F-35 has been assembled outside the United States. It also demonstrates the ability of the Italian facility to complete the fifth generation stealth aircraft and underscores the global partnerships within the F-35 program. Beyond this production accomplishment, the flight test program continues to progress with completion at the 1,000 sortie at Luke Air Force Base, the 500 sortie at Nellis Air Force Base and the overall F-35 fleet surpassing 30,000 flight hours. These events highlight the increasing tempo of flight operations across the country at an expanding number of sites. New business support of the program continue to grow internationally this quarter with letters of acceptance signed by Israel for 14 additional aircraft and by Turkey for four aircraft. Additionally, the Netherlands placed an order for its first batch of eight production aircraft. These recent actions reflect the expanding commitments by international countries to secure this fifth generation aircraft for their future fighter fleets. It’s noteworthy that the program of record identifies over 700 aircraft to be acquired by 11 international countries and illustrates the strong future demand for the F-35 by our allies. Almost half of the projected annual orders over the next 5 years are scheduled to be placed by international customers, demonstrating the importance of international participation on the program. Turning to the development program, we have continued to finalize the software that will enable initial operating capability or IOC of the STOVL aircraft for the U.S. Marine Corps later this year and are also progressing on the software that will enable the Air Force variant aircraft to achieve IOC in 2016. This past quarter, we successfully conducted initial flight test of the enhanced software that will be used to provide IOC to carrier variant aircraft. The commencement of these flights with this software is the key element to enable us to provide this revolutionary aircraft to the U.S. Navy in 2018. Overall, the F-35 program is retiring development risk, increasing the production tempo and securing new contract awards as we expand our activities on the program. Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to highlight two noteworthy milestones that occurred earlier this month in our aeronautics business and a key event this past quarter in our Mission Systems and Training business. On the Aeronautics C-130 program, we were enormously proud to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the rollout and first flight of the inaugural production C-130 Hercules in April 1955. With almost 2,500 C-130s delivered around the world to 63 countries, it remains the world’s most fielded cargo aircraft. The C-130 program has the sole distinction as the world’s longest, continuously operating military production line. Since the debut of the A model 60 years ago, the C-130 has incorporated multiple model revisions, product improvements and upgrades, and it’s evolution to the J version produced today. This 60-year history of continuous improvement also created demand by commercial customers seeking to reconstitute their aging L-100 airlifter fleets with a new LM-100J version extending the footprint of its program beyond domestic and international government customers. On the C-5M program, a super galaxy aircraft recently established 45 pending new world records in airlift capabilities. And after the results are certified, we will hold a new total of 86 aeronautics records. Our upgrade program to install 25% more powerful and fuel-efficient engines on the aircraft has significantly enhanced the ability of the C-5M to reach speeds at a faster rate than predecessor versions and enable cargo transport over longer distance between refueling. We are very proud of our upgrade actions on this airlifter as we deliver expanded strategic air mobility capabilities to world fighters. With unmatched flexibility, versatility and relevance, the C-130 and C-5 aircraft will continue to provide essential airlift service for our nation and international users for years to come. Turning to Mission Systems and Training, in February, we were honored to participate with the Air Force at the groundbreaking ceremony at Kwajalein Atoll to mark the start of the construction for the Space Fence radar system. This ground-based radar system will improve the way objects are tracked in orbit and increase the ability to predict and prevent space-based collisions. The multi-year program will also serve as one of the drivers for future sales growth in the MST business area as we deliver this critical enhancement to our national capabilities. I will now ask Bruce to go through the details of the first quarter financial performance and our increased 2015 guidance and then we will open up the line for your questions.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Beginning with Chart 3, we have an overview of our first quarter results. Sales for the quarter were $10.1 billion and this was in line with our expectations. We will provide more color on our sales results on the next chart. Our segment operating margin was better than expected in the quarter at 12.9% and enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $2.74. We generated $957 million in cash from operations also in line with our expectations, but lower than we have historically generated in the first quarter. We will discuss the quarterly phasing of our projected cash from operations for the year in a few charts. Our cash deployment actions remain strong with $1.1 billion of cash return to shareholders, including more than $600 million in share repurchases. And because of our operating performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our full year outlook for both operating profit and earnings per share. So, I think we are off to a very solid start to 2015. On Chart 4, we compared our first quarter sales results for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales are lower by about 5% compared with the first quarter of last year, but as you recall, we said that this was our expectation during the January call. The lower sales level was driven primarily by two business areas, Missiles and Fire Control and Aeronautics. In both cases, fewer deliveries drove the reductions, PAC-3 and tactical missile deliveries and Missiles and Fire Control and three fewer aircraft deliveries in aeronautics. We remain on track to achieve the sales outlook we provided at the beginning of the year. Chart 5 compares our segment operating margin this quarter with the first quarter of 2014. Segment operating margin was 50 basis points lower this quarter compared with the same period last year, but remained near historically high levels. Three of the five business areas had higher margins this year than in the first quarter of 2014 with Space Systems having the largest increase due to higher risk retirements. Mission Systems and Training had a strong performance quarter, but was unable to match its near record level margin results from the first quarter of last year. IS&GS’ margin was down considerably from last year at this time, though we had expected a fairly large reduction when we provided our outlook for the year in January. The first quarter results were lower than expected due to performance issues on an international program. Results from the rest of the IS&GS portfolio of programs were stronger than expected and we are able to offset much, but not all of the impacts of this program. Overall, our performance was better than expected and resulted in our increase in segment operating profit for the full year. Turning to Chart 6, we will review our earnings per share results this quarter with our results from a year ago. Our EPS of $2.74 was $0.13 lower than the results from last year, but higher than our expectations and because of this, we increased our EPS for the year as we will discuss in a few charts. Chart 7 provides details into our cash deployment actions during the quarter. And as we previously mentioned, we repurchased more than $600 million of our shares in the quarter, more than we had planned in our initial guidance projections and combined with dividends paid of nearly $500 million when we returned $1.1 billion of cash to our stockholders or 131% of our free cash flow in the quarter. We expect to have a larger amount of share repurchases in the second quarter, utilizing the greater level of cash we have on the balance sheet as a result of the debt issuance we had in late February. On Chart 8, we discuss our updated outlook for our full year 2015 results. We are not changing our guidance for either orders or sales at this time, though orders in the first quarter were slightly ahead of our expectations. Sales, as we mentioned earlier, were as we expected in the quarter. We are increasing our profit projections by $50 million as a result of our strong performance in the first quarter. We are also increasing our earnings per share guidance by $0.05, but there are several moving pieces that deserve more explanation and we will provide that on the next chart. We are leaving our cash from operations guidance unchanged, but I do want to mention that our phasing this year will look different compared to our results in recent years. We expect that our quarterly cash phasing will be significantly weighted towards the second half of the year with as much as two-thirds of our cash coming in the last two quarters of the year. We expect this phasing in part because our cash collections will mirror the increased delivery rates we expect throughout the rest of the year, and we anticipate reaching final agreement on a number of contracts in the second half of the year that will bring cash collections with them. Chart 9 provides a reconciliation between our prior EPS outlook and our current expectations. The increase in our segment operating profit outlook will increase our expected EPS by $0.11 per share. As we previously mentioned, our share repurchase activity in the first quarter was slightly higher than we had planned and we also had a lower level of options exercised in the quarter than we were expecting. The combination of these two items results at a lower average share count level than our previous projections and improves our estimated EPS for the year by $0.07. We now project our full year average share count will be just over 315 million shares. Offsetting these EPS increases is the additional interest for the remainder of the year for the debt issuance that closed in February. Netting these changes together, we now expect our EPS for the year will be $0.05 higher than we guided in January to a new range of $10.85 to $11.15 per share. On Chart 10, we provide our sales outlook by business area for the year with no change from the outlook we provided in January. Chart 11 shows our current outlook for segment operating profit compared with what we were expecting last quarter. We increased our profit outlook in four of our five business areas with Space Systems having the largest increase for the year at $30 million. The other three business areas for each increased by $10 million to $15 million and we lowered our expected full year profit for IS&GS by $20 million for the reasons we previously discussed. And the net change for the company was a $50 million increase in our segment operating profit outlook. Finally, Chart 12 provides our summary of the quarter. We are off to a solid start for the year with our results either tracking to or exceeding our expectations for the first quarter. We remain committed to our cash deployment actions to generate returns for our stockholders and the breath and strength of our portfolio will enable us to achieve these results. With that, we are ready for questions. Karen?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.
Peter Arment: Yes. Good morning Marillyn and Bruce.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: How are you?
Peter Arment: Bruce could you, I guess give us a little – if you can give us a little more color on the – you said the $70 million adjustment or lower profit I guess accrual in IS&GS in the quarter from the international program?
Bruce Tanner: Sure. I will start and if Marillyn has something to add to this, she will surely do so. So this was a fairly good sized international program. One of our sort of commanding control entrance that we are selling internationally, this was a pretty complex system that we were developing under Iran and as we got into the actual integration of this system in country that turned out to be more complicated than we originally anticipated. We think the charge that we took in the first quarter has this effort, I will say sized appropriately for the remaining work to be done. But I think importantly, we also think that there is a greater market potential for this product once it’s installed and it’s showing its capabilities. So we are optimistic there is a chance for future profitable sales with this impact or with this product going forward. I think the good news in the quarter with an IS&GS is there – if there were a number of performance improvements in the rest of the portfolio, so the way I kind of think about it is we have one issue, one fairly large issue on a large program that was offset by a sort of a number of improvements across the rest of the portfolio or maybe said it differently, but for that IS&GS, we have had a very strong quarter except for that one contracts.
Marillyn Hewson: I don’t have anything more to add other than just to say that the contract size is less than $500 million, so just to keep it in perspective.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Rob Spingarn: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi Rob.
Rob Spingarn: I just wanted to follow-up on the profit side. Your margin guidance is generally below your performance in all the segments than what you saw in the first quarter, especially when you made the adjustment in IS&GS for the $70 million, so was there anything other than conservatism baked in there?
Bruce Tanner: Rob, I don’t think that we have consciously tried to bake either conservatism or optimism in there. We always start every year by saying that or at least I think I do by saying that we think we have the potential as we go throughout the year to have similar levels of risk retirements and profit pickups through the year as we had in prior years. This issue that it is on the international program and IS&GS is the thing that sort of proves that that’s it can sometimes go both ways there. So these are not just given, this is not just conservatism as we go throughout the rest of the year. As we look forward, I think the timing of risk events – there tend to be the back end has a few less events than we have had in the first part of the year. We also had in particular, with the Space Systems for instance, significantly higher weighted ULA equity earnings in the first quarter as compared to the whole year. I want to say, if you look at on a percentage basis, probably 45% of the equity earnings for Space Systems occurred in the first quarter and the remaining 55% or so will be spread over the next three quarters. So it’s just a lot of facing. We did have a couple of – within the business areas a couple of sort of contractual or administrative settlements that happened in the first quarter that we are not expecting to materialize in the next three quarters as we sit here today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.
Rich Safran: Hi, good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Rich Safran: Marillyn, I heard your remarks about the budget at the opening. If so, if we assume for just a moment that the FY ‘16 budget is above the spending caps maybe closer to the request or if OCO funds are applied, I wanted to know if you had the sense of what the priorities would be for any additional funds where there might be upside to Lockheed Martin programs, is this the kind of thing that would impact your short cycle business at IS&GS or is this long cycle business or maybe both?
Marillyn Hewson: So, first of all, I mean in terms of the budget itself, you are right, the President base budget is significantly above the Budget Control Act sequestration budget caps that were out there. And but just to remind you, those limits still remain in place from FY ‘16 and beyond. So it’s important that Congress address that as they move forward and they took a stab at it with these solutions by increasing the OCO in order to fund some additional spending, but until they do some statutory change, that really doesn’t change the sequestration that’s out there. So we really need the President to consent to these – to the OCO offers that they have and he wants an increase in both defense and domestic spending cuts I mean cap, so we know that’s the case. However, back to your question about what it means for us, certainly F-35 and C-130Js are important. In fact, if you looked at what’s comes through on the unfunded priorities list, there are six F-35Bs on that list coming in from the Marine Corps and another eight F-35s or Cs for the Navy that are on the unfunded priorities list. So to the extent that additional funding is found that’s important. Moreover on the C-130, there are another 13 aircraft there and the KC-130J have another two aircraft. And then there is a number of other items that have additional funding that are in our portfolio as we go forward. I would just say that in terms of long cycle versus short cycle business, it’s you hit right on, I mean building an aircraft, doing a long lead funding and going through the production process, we are well over 3 years on our aircraft and when they are in development even longer than that with the F-35. And so as we get things lined up, it’s as we get funded for these then that business there is just a long cycle business that will be in our portfolio, will be in our backlog and that’s important. A lot of things also are related to what happens with our troops and what’s going on in the various conflicts around the world and so we will just have to watch how that transpires as well as to what kind of funding that Congress and the DoD in order to address those continuing threats.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard Rubel: Hi, good morning Marillyn and Bruce and Jerry. Thank you for your remarks.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning.
Howard Rubel: Marillyn, there has been countless headlines about all the challenges the F-35 faces, some of them are history that people like to dredge up and talk about things that you have already solved in terms of problems. And then there are things that you are still wrestling with everyday, can you kind of bring us to the point where we understand how to ignore some of the bad news and how you are coping with some of these issues that still aren’t where you would like them to be?
Marillyn Hewson: Great question. Thank you for that question. We are challenged with that regularly because it is the largest program with the Department of Defense and it’s a complex development program, so it’s challenging in that sense. And every year as you know the GAO comes out with their annual report. There is an OT&E report that comes out annually to Congress. There are a myriad of reports that are required just given the size of the program, so we take every one of those reports into account. We read them all. They are not always exactly right and I think that’s just the facts of the matter. What we try to do is stay focused on performance because that’s the first and foremost thing that we can do to continue to keep this program on track. I will say from a status standpoint, if you look back at some of the technical challenges we had early on, we have solved the landing hook. We solved the helmet issues. The software programs are going well. So from that perspective, the program is maturing. The development program that we are moving through, we are 65% complete on that. And we're going to continue to ramp up the production. Manufacturing is going well. Last year, we delivered 36 aircraft from 2014 and this year we are going to deliver about 45, so you can see it ramping up. We are going to – as I mentioned earlier, the initial operating capability, IOC for the Marine Corps, is going to be happening this summer and you have heard from the Marine Corps that they are confident. We are also confident that they will meet their IOC. And so from that perspective, I think the key is to not react to every media write-up is going to say it’s largest program and it will reflect back on initial stages of the program, but if you look at – since we rebaselined the program in 2010, we have been on track with our cost and our schedule performance. We have rolled out a blueprint for affordability jointly with the U.S. government that is driving cost down. And by the time we move into full rate production, the cost of the F-35 will be comparable or lower than a fourth generation fighter with much more capabilities. So, I would just encourage you to continue to watch us track through the ramp up of the production, the things we are doing to drive the cost down and as we continue to move through the flight test program. And as each of these services declared their initial operating capability and as we continue to rollout more and more capability to the aircraft, I think that our nation and our allies are going to be very proud to have the requirements, the national security requirements capabilities that this aircraft will provide for many decades to come.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.
Cai Von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much. Aeronautics, help me understand you did 11.8% margin in the first quarter with deliveries expected to get better as we go through the year on the mature programs and yet it looks like the margin goes down. And as I read your commentary, it doesn’t look like there is anything abnormal in terms of the positives, I mean there is that $25 million risk retirement, but so why don’t the aeronautics margins kind of hold near where the first quarter is for the rest of the year?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So, Cai, I will take that one on. I think probably the biggest reason is we have got two things going on there. One, we have a pretty good size ramp obviously on the F-35 program in total as compared to the rest even with the delivery increases that you talked about. So, you have the F-35 dilution effect occurring there. I think what maybe lost a little bit in your question there is C-5 deliveries are expected to increase fairly significantly over the first quarter just in terms of quantities and that’s another program that has a lower margin than the overall aeronautics program in general. And I think the combination of those two is what we are seeing right now offsetting the higher margin we had in the first quarter. But having said that, I still think we are going to end the year at 11% or more and I do think there are – there is potential that we can do a little better than that of some of the risk retirements break a little early for us or come a little larger than we have in our current outlook.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ron Epstein: Hey, good morning. Just a quick question for Bruce just a couple of details. When you look at the financials, it looks like this year if you add up your accounts receivables and inventories, divide it by sales, you are running at a little bit of a higher rate, that’s 95% than you historically have. At least for recent history, recent history seems like it’s been more like in the 70% to 80% range. What’s driving that? What’s driving that buildup in working capital?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So, a couple of things, I think if you just look at the first quarter, Ron, we have a historically low AR at the end of the year is sort of the payment offices clean up everything, if you will, on their docket, if you will. A lot of it has to do even with the timing of when we closed the first quarter. So, I think historically, you actually do see that we usually have a spike in our accounts receivable in the first quarter, because of those two phenomenon. Inventory is growing a little bit. And in part, that’s one of the elements I was trying to describe in my prepared remarks that talk about some of the contractual resolutions are contractual finalizations that we are expecting in the second half of the year. We expect to have some collections associated with those as things like our billing arrangements get finalized and the performance-based payments terms get finalized. And so we would expect to have some reduction in our inventory account going forward. At the end of the day, Ron, I think our – the spike we see in working capital in general for all elements of working capital, not just AR and inventory, we expect that, that will probably come down over the next three quarters of the year and probably end the year, not too differently than where we started the year or ended the year 2014.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason Gursky: Hi, good morning everyone.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Jason.
Jason Gursky: I just wanted to ask a question about missile defense in the marketplace there today in light of recent awards that have been going on internationally. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics that are going on there and what you think the opportunity that is for Lockheed with the various products you have had and the contribution to Patriot, just kind of update us on the market and what the opportunities are specifically for Lockheed going forward?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, sure. I would just start by saying that it continues to be an expanding demand for missile defense in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East for our products, along the lines of the THAAD, Aegis, Aegis Assure, Patriot, and potentially MEADS as well. As we look at, for example, MEADS, I know there was an announcement today about Raytheon winning the opportunity in Poland, but we have bought Patriot or PAC-3 is part of that system – that Patriot system. So, it’s an opportunity there for us as well, but we still have an opportunity in Poland that meets international and selected to participate in technical dialogue on a short range air and missile defense system called Narew in Poland and we expect to continue to be in that dialogue. And that’s one that the MEADS system is the only one that offers the capability, network and integrate on a variety of air missile defense system elements, including things that are developed in Poland, their sensors, their command and control, etcetera. And in Germany in the midst of their evaluation to make their decision on their air and missile defense system and as you know, they have invested a fair amount into the MEADS system along with Italy and the U.S. And so we expect to participate in that opportunity and we hope that they will select, meet as they move forward on their selection. Around the world though, I think there continues to be a very strong demand as you look at Aegis continues to be a demand for Aegis. Aegis Assure we stood up or are in the midst of standing up our Aegis Assure in Romania, we have another in Poland. And so that opportunity in the European theater is also important. There are discussions with – there is South Korea on both PAC-3 and ultimately on THAAD, interest in the Middle East by a number of countries on PAC-3 and THAAD. So, I think that you are going to continue to see – continue demand for our portfolio that we have a very strong set of products and capabilities in that arena that’s going to continue to have a demand.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak: Hi, good morning everybody.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Noah.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Noah Poponak: Bruce, on the debt you raised intra-quarter, it kind of looks like the interest expense you have added to your full year earnings outlook includes interest on all of that, is that true? And it looks like intra-quarter you were discussing the potential to use some of that to refi. So if you do that, is there an opportunity to later reduce the interest expense for the full year? And then beyond refi, what else are you going to do with this cash?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, good questions, Noah. So, I think the average interest rate for the – because we did it in three tranches of varying sizes, but the average interest rate is about 3.5%. So, I think to your question – your first question, I think we are just taking the 3.5% with the last 10.5 months or 9.5 months whatever it is of exposure on the debt. And that is what the interest calculation is for this year. Going forward, we did talk to you, I think on the last – not on the last call because I’d have the intra-quarter to your point, but I think in the disclosure we did for that we described that we would potentially look at taking out some near-term debt maturities that mature in 2016. We actually have sort of two tranches that happened in 2016. They worth a little less than $1 billion combined and so we would expect that and those are – one of those at least, as a fairly good sized interest has pretty – a fairly good sized interest coupon on the debt. So we would expect interest to mitigate some in 2016 as we take out that roughly $1 billion of debt with the proceeds. And then the rest of it is strictly general purpose Noah. And as I try to tee up in the earlier remarks, I do think that we could use the potential for that for additional share repurchases throughout the rest of this year and moving into 2016.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning.
Hunter Keay: So Marillyn, you talked a little bit about the – you reiterated 25% international mix over the next few years, but do you feel like maybe given an improving domestic budget environment right now, that may be that number kind of goes back to the 20% level over the next couple of years if you maybe consider that 25% going higher as maybe a function of maybe worsening domestic environment budgetary conditions, if the domestic budget environment continues to get a little better than we all thought, may be last year at this point, is the international opportunity is that still robust enough for you to get to that 25% level even if domestic is picking up better?
Marillyn Hewson: My answer to that would be yes, absolutely. I mean our backlog today is $20 billion in international backlog at the end of 2014 and that’s a significant backlog for us. The quality and maturity of the portfolio and that we are selling around the world is going to continue to have a demand. And as you probably know what we talked about and I think I even said it in my remarks, over half of the orders on the F-35 are going to be the international customers in the next 5 years. So that program alone is going to continue to grow. Earlier in my comments about missile defense, continued strong demand from missile defense. And we expect countries, besides the countries that are program of record on the F-35 there are going to be others that are going to need to retire their fourth generation aircraft, so we expect other countries to want to procure the F-35. Airlift C-130s and 72 countries and the Js is going to continue to be in demand as some of those countries upgrade their airlift capability to the J. So I would say that we are going to continue to be on a path to get to 25% over the next few years and at the same time as budgets recover and defense will continue to sell within the U.S. So I think both elements of our portfolio will continue to rise. But I do expect just given the backlog and given the opportunities that we have on the international front that we will achieve the 25%.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Harned: Thank you. Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning Doug.
Doug Harned: I wanted to go back to IS&GS and I know that you have been getting more international orders, so your backlog has a larger international component and you talked about the issue you had with this one contract, could you describe the kinds of international orders you have been winning are these – do these tend to be fixed price in nature, which in theory could give you some upside in margin, but also expose you to potentially more risk, I am just interested in so how large international is becoming an IS&GS and what the opportunity and the potential risk might be there?
Bruce Tanner: And so Doug let me try to give you a little color to that. So the international content and IS&GS is growing not leaps and bounds, but it’s growing from a fairly small beginning, I will say toward now I am just thinking of top of my head is probably in the maybe 10%, maybe a little less than that, something like 7% or 10% or so of the sales of IS&GS maybe a little less than that even is what our international content is. But think of that as much higher than it was say 3 years or 4 years ago, so that part of the business is growing. Almost all thinking that there is an exception to that, but I will say almost all the international work that we are doing, not just in IS&GS, but around the whole company is in fact from fixed price efforts, so there is both upside and downside risk associated with doing that which I think a lot of this is sort of doing IT work for us, that’s what we are doing in Australia is not dissimilar than what we are doing with the Pentagon here in the United States, sort of aggregating a lot of the systems and making those systems, doing upgrades, making those systems perform better and doing the overall system development work for all the IT services for – in this case, the Ministry of Defense or Department of Defense in Australia. We do a lot of cyber work internationally. We are getting – that’s a growing portion of the business as the next one that we are very happy to work. I think our reputation is spreading sort of across the globe as we do work for individual countries and in some cases, individual firms within those countries that sort of gets word-of-mouth sales that happen elsewhere. We also do internationally within IS&GS, a lot of airport management or air traffic management type activities, so the things that we do with our FAA business in the United States, think of that is doing it elsewhere, but also a lot of – sort of productivity sorts of things from an airport perspective internationally. So that’s probably the three big pieces. Well, I should say there is also a little bit of Intel piece, similar – not dissimilar again to what we do with our Intel customers in the United States. So probably those four pieces Doug you should think of us what we are doing internationally within IS&GS and that portion is growing pretty significantly for us from again a fairly modest start a few years ago to where it is today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland: Hey, good morning all.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Carter Copeland: Just a quick clarification on that, Bruce with that being 7% to 10% and Marillyn’s comment earlier about less than $500 million, it would make that seem like that’s probably the largest program in IS&GS on the international side, is that correct?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. It’s - I don’t know but it is the largest, Carter. But it's one of the largest that we have, one of probably a couple of that – for that size. And I was looking at some data here, I think the actual number is slightly less than 10% for IS&GS, a little more specificity than I gave Doug on the previous question.
Carter Copeland: Great. And on the aerospace margin front, you teed up on the prior call and during the quarter some potential upside, you had talked about 100 basis points on the F-35 development contract. And once that sort of got – the delays from last year worked their way through and also on the C-5 even excluding the over and aboves and I wondered you highlighted the small amount of risk retirements on F-35, but I wondered if you could just give an update on the progress on both of those?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So probably I want to correct something, I think I heard that you say we weren’t talking about development program increases, we were talking about production improvement.
Carter Copeland: Production, correct. Sorry.
Bruce Tanner: So what you saw in the first quarter and what we disclosed in earnings release was one of those risk retirements that we were expecting to happen, that’s actually probably one of the larger ones that will happen throughout the rest of the year at least this planning wise, that’s one of the reasons why the margins in the first quarter were in fact higher than what we expect for the rest of the year. So I think that’s tracking to what I said earlier and what I had talked about the potential 100 basis point improvement in the production program year-over-year from ‘14 to ’15, I still think is doable and on track as we sit here today. C-5, we talked about that program in the past about the potential for a step up over time. I still think that’s the path that we are looking at doing in the latter part of the year. And again as you alluded to and I will make the comment, none of those considers the potential for some entitlement actions that we have relative to the over and above work that would be separate and distinct from this. This is just sort of recognizing that we are doing a better job of sort of turning out the aircraft in the short-term cycles and the like that are resulting in better performance on that contract for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton: Great. Thanks and good morning. The question I had was on space and in particular the margin performance you had in the first quarter and I think you have about $125 million of headwind on ULA for the rest of the year, so I get that, but it does look like certainly the risk retirements at Orion and the government side and probably across the portfolio are better than we have seen in a while. So I am just curious usually good things follow good things, was there a certain risk retirement related to Orion and government programs? Were you reaching kind of critical milestones or is Space just looking like it’s probably going to be a source of continued upside for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Yes, so good question, Myles, you should think of Space Systems as having a couple of risk retirements that happened in the first quarter. One of them was associated with the Orion vehicle. This was actually associated with the launch we did last year as we sort of finalized the results of that in the first quarter of this year. We kind of trued up our booking position if you will for that event and that resulted in a step up associated with that event that will not repeat itself obviously in the next three quarters. We also had some – a couple of one-offs in the quarter for things like some reliability incentives that we had at least one of the contracts within Space Systems, if not another one. And that just happened to fall in the first quarter, if you will. So, we have got a pretty good increase associated with that reliability incentives and that also reflected part of the effort this quarter that won’t happen going forward. I will also remind you that as you said the latter three quarters of the year we have the ULA totally different profile than what we have had last quarter. And again as I made comments earlier much lower equity earnings going forward as compared to the first quarter. I will also remind you though that we do have what’s left as sort of the restructuring costs that are not – that have not been taken, but are reflected in our operating performance and those will continue to happen in the next three quarters without the benefit of the step-ups that we took in the first quarter. So, combined I know there is a lot of moving pieces I just gave you there, but combined is that’s why we look at the margins doing what they do in the next three quarters for Space Systems. What I will say though is Space Systems is performing very, very well right now. And so I look at that and say there is the potential for opportunity as we go forward every year we do have opportunity and we are performing very, very well on our government contracts and Space Systems. There is a lot of incentive-based contracts there, where if we do well we obviously get the margins associated with that, but the government gets flipside of those incentive contracts as well. And so we are performing very well there. And I think we have some potential to do even better going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stallard from RBC.
Rob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Rob.
Rob Stallard: Bruce, I was wondering – just quick question on the book-to-bill. I was wondering if you could comment on the various trends that you are seeing there, particularly down the short cycle side and when we might see some improvement in perhaps the IS&GS book-to-bill through this year?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So, Rob, maybe I will just give you – I thought that there might be a question on orders, so maybe I will just give you sort of a little bit of a full overview of where we sit from orders perspective. Sort of it, it has been our history at least the last few years, we are going to be significantly back-end weighted in our orders for the year. And as we sit here today, it wouldn’t surprise me if there is probably 65% or so of the orders that we are expecting to have for the year will actually materialize in the second half of the year. And you should think about – we have got quite a few big ticket items to sort of keep your eye on, so we have got the bomber awards some time in the summer of this year. We have got finalization of the C-130J multiyear. We have got the next production lot, Lot 9 of the F-35 program occurring. And with that – and it’s just a lot of contracts, but they add up to a lot of dollars individually – or collectively, they add up to a lot of dollars, just a whole lot the various F-35 sustainment contracts and long lead contracts for future LRIPs. And you combine that with a lot of the international orders we are looking at for THAAD and PAC-3, for instance and you see there is some pretty big chunky sized orders coming in the next three months, but more weighted with second half of the year. I didn’t mention JLTV, but that’s obviously another critical strategic win. So, the big strategic items we are looking for from a competitive perspective this year are the bomber award and JLTV. To your specific question on IS&GS, I think we are going to – last year, we actually grew backlog in IS&GS which was the first time we have done that for a while. As we look forward, I think the IS&GS orders are probably sequentially going to grow and get close to the sales value, but probably not as much as the sales for the year, so we will probably have some reduction in our backlog in IS&GS as we close the year. In part because we did recall, we did get so many orders in 2014 that were sort of multi-year orders that won’t be replicated, if you will in 2015. Just – and maybe one last comment, we still think as we sit here today and we said this for a couple of years in a row, we do think we are on a track to get back similar to where we started at the end of last year about $80 plus million level for total backlog for the corporation.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning. Bruce, I was wondering if you could talk a little more, you talked about the phasing just now of the orders you have done it on the cash flow, can you talk a little bit about maybe the earnings as we go through the year. And then also the buyback activity should it be fairly ratable at this $600 million and related to that, you mentioned the options exercise, is there a point where we start to see the share count really move down when we get to the other side of those options, is that this year?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Of course, we will try to hit all of those for you Sam. So overall margins, I think we had a bit of a spike, probably not unlike what we did last year, frankly as the corporation, I think we came down from a pretty high first quarter and we dropped the next 3 quarters. A lot of that’s just the phasing and timing of when we get some of our awards and some of our incentives on our contracts across all of the business areas. So I would expect margins would be probably lower over the next three quarters. I think the second and third quarters will probably be similar to each other whereas the fourth we could have a little bit higher margin. So thinking of the second and third, probably running in the low-11s and maybe as we sit here today, with the timing of our risk retirements, the fourth quarter could actually be in sort of the high-11s going forward, that’s sort of how we see it as we sit here today. And again, as I said on an earlier comment, if we pull some of those to the left or do them or do higher adjustments than we had in our plan, obviously we could get better than that or worse than that. So repo, second part of your question, the repo activity, we did $600 million in the first quarter. We would expect to do more in the second quarter. If I was to predict, I would say it’s going to be maybe not twice as much as we did in the first quarter, but it wouldn’t surprise me if we did as much as $1 billion or so in the second quarter and then I think we will trail off maybe a little bit in the third and fourth, that’s as we sit here today. And a lot of that’s based on sort of the cash that was available on the balance sheet in the first quarter versus what we have got after the debt issuance in February that enables us to do that, that sort of enhanced repos for the rest of the year. There are about 900,000 options that were exercised in the first quarter. We started the year with about a little more than 6 million options outstanding. As I said earlier in the prepared remarks, we were expecting options actually to have a higher level of exercising than we experienced in the first quarter. So we are watching that closely and last year, I think we did 3.7 million or 3.4 million shares, that’s we are kind of expecting in our guidance right now about 3 million for the year, so that will be the toggle switch as to whether or not we do higher or lower than that. The last thing I will say on that, on the option exercise is you asked the question about would we expect to see sort of a step function decrease. And I think the answer is yes to that. Sam as soon as the options have been exercised, there are no options replenishing those if you will, so this is a diminishing number in our dilution equation that once those 5 million options are left or exercised, they will not be replicated by a like number of options going forward. So in the way, I usually like to describe it as every single dollar of share repurchase spent once we are at that point, where we no longer have options we will have a greater chance of actually reducing the share count of the corporation.
Jerry Kircher: Karen, I think we have got time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes, good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
George Shapiro: Marillyn, I just wanted to ask your strategy in the cyber world, you obviously saw Raytheon make a big acquisition yesterday in the commercial cyber world. You are a big player in this area, if you can just kind of lay out what your strategy is?
Marillyn Hewson: Sure. I will be happy to. I mean, it is an important area for us as a company. For the past 20 years consecutively, we have been the largest IT provider for the U.S. government and working for all of the cabinet agencies on a range of IT as well as cyber security. I like the portfolio that we have around cyber security. We have a multi-decade track record with encryption, with data security solutions. And we centralized all of our cyber security in the IS&GS organization. And so and our go-to-market strategy both within the U.S. government as well as commercial, that’s where we are moving forward. We see incremental growth there and we rolled out and even internationally, as Bruce commented earlier, we have a cyber security intelligence center in Farnborough in the UK. We have another one in Canberra, Australia. We have our own here in the U.S. So, it is absolutely an important growth area for us. And I think what’s key to us is that we have been doing cyber security long before they ever coined the term cyber security. So, it’s a very important growth area for us and one that we expect to continue to excel in.
Jerry Kircher: I think that wraps it up for the time. Let me turn it over to Marillyn for final comments.
Marillyn Hewson: Well, let me just conclude today, I just want to reiterate that the corporation has had another solid quarter and it’s well positioned to deliver even higher value to customers and stockholders in 2015. The ongoing execution of our employees coupled with our growing cash generation, our strong backlog of work and a solid balance sheet will continue to prevail our corporation forward in 2015 and beyond. So, thanks again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you in the next earnings call in July. Karen, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.

Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. We hope that your new year is off to a great start. Let me begin by saying that I am extraordinarily proud of our Lockheed Martin team. We finished another strong year in 2014 achieving excellent financial and program performance. Our performance has the corporation well positioned to continue to deliver value to customers and stockholders in 2015. The daily efforts of our employees are the foundation of our ability to deliver broad-based results across the corporation and I thank them for their ongoing contribution. While Bruce will cover the financial results in detail later on in the call, I want to highlight a few key achievements and strategic items from my perspective as we closed out 2014. Starting with new business, the corporation continues to be successful in securing new order bookings for both domestic and international customers. In the fourth quarter we achieved a strong 130% book-to-bill ratio for contract awards above sales and finished the year with a backlog of nearly $81 billion. This marks the fourth consecutive year that we have maintained our backlog in excess of $80 billion. Our new business success is aided by having the best position portfolio of programs in the sector with direct and unique alignment to many of the essential programs identified by both international and domestic customers. These factors have enabled us to build a strong backlog consisting of multiple years of longer cycle production program and provides a strategic differentiation and financial foundation of future work. I was also pleased that the international content of our backlog grew to more than $20 billion, representing over 25% of our total yearend backlog. The international component has us well positioned to achieve our stated goal of expanding sales from international customers to at least 25% of total corporate sales in the next few years. This expected international growth also provides a significant benefit to our domestic customer by enabling economies of scale and additional cost leverage achieved through higher production volumes on programs across our portfolio. Strategically, our corporate-wide emphasis on fast [training] [ph] and expanding customer relationships and focusing on how we may best support their critical needs continues to provide a pivotal role in securing new business awards. This past quarter, I had the opportunity to expand our international relationships by travelling to the Middle East and meeting with key customers. My activities in Abu Dhabi included participating in the opening of our Center for Innovation and security solutions in Masdar City, further strengthening the corporation's nearly 40-year relationship with the United Arab Emirates. I also travelled to Bahrain for discussions with high level representatives on our products and how we can best help them satisfy their critical national security requirements. The common theme across my meetings was that all parties I spoke with reaffirmed their unwavering desire to secure the most effective solutions and products essential for national security, in spite of any volatility in world oil markets and price levels. Another strategic focus area where we have a long record of success is the generation and deployment of annual cash flows. In 2014, we generated almost $3.9 billion in annual operating cash after making $2 billion in pension contributions. This strong cash generation enabled us to provide a return of over 120% of our annual free cash flow to stockholders in 2014. As we enter 2015, we are solidly on the cash deployment plan we outlined during the October call, where we identified our goal to make at least $2 billion in share repurchases in 2015 and to reduce our total outstanding share count to below 300 million shares by the end of 2017. Share repurchases of this magnitude, coupled with our annual dividend payments would result in returning virtually all of our annual free cash to stockholders over the next three years. Beyond the significant returns of cash to stockholders, our increasing cash flow also enabled us to invest in the future of the corporation in areas such as research and development. We continue to expand our focus and allocation of resources on next generation technologies and products. In 2014, we increased investments in independent research and development activities to over $750 million, reflecting the third consecutive year of significant increases in the strategically important area. We are constantly pursuing new technology based solutions as we design and develop leap-ahead technologies to help address some of the world's most complex challenges faced by domestic and international customers. These efforts will ensure we stay at the leading edge of technology and create potential foundations for future new business and important strategic positioning. Moving to operations, one of the highlights of this past quarter was the near flawless inaugural test flight of our Orion spacecraft. This flight successfully tested key systems of the capsule to help pave the way for future missions into deep space and capture the imagination of people around the world. The flight successfully tested a number of technologies that are fundamental to future deep space missions and included environmental and safety elements essential to the future of human space travel. We are extraordinarily proud and pleased to be the prime contractor of the Orion vehicle and look forward to proving this unique exploration vehicle -- I am sorry, look forward to providing this unique exploration vehicle to NASA and our country for decades to come. In addition to the Orion operational achievement this past quarter, key milestones were also achieved on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program with progress in developmental testing and increased production quantity and tempo. On the development program, a major milestone was accomplished with the F-35 carrier variant, successfully completing on-ship trials aboard the USS Nimitz. The maturity and performance of the aircraft enabled achievement of 100% of the threshold test points and also included multiple successful night landings and launches during the aircraft's first test deployment at sea. Beyond the carrier test for the U.S. Navy, we are also on track to provide the capabilities of this revolutionary fighter to our armed forces, with initial operational capability of the F-35 STOVL variant for the U.S. marine core later this year. In the projection arena, I am very proud of our aeronautics team as they achieve the delivery target of 36 aircraft in 2014. This was particularly noteworthy as the team was able to overcome a nearly one month program hold for the engine anomaly that occurred last June and still achieved annual aircraft delivery goals. This achievement is further illustration of the program’s growing stability and production ramp up. Overall, the F-35 aircraft fleet continues to expand with 109 production jets delivered since program inception and fleet operations now surpassing 25,000 flight hours. Customer support and funding for the program is strong and growing. Finalization of the LRIP-8 contract was completed this past quarter for 43 aircraft, reflecting a significant increase in order quantity above the 32 to 36 annual aircraft awards we received during the previous four fiscal years. This new award helped bring year-in 2014 backlog of aircraft on the program to 100 planes. Looking forward, domestic and international customers, order phasing, outline of plant procurement of 61 aircrafts for the upcoming LRIP-9 contract, further expanding the solid growth curve in aircraft quantity. This increased rate of aircraft orders is an essential component to our ability to ramp up production levels and achieve the reduced price of the planes outlined in our blueprint for Affordability Agreement with the F-35 customer. I would like to conclude my remarks with a brief status of government budget. Last month, the U.S. Government passed the fiscal year 2015 omnibus spending bill to finance most federal activities through the end of the current fiscal year. Passengers have still eliminated much of the procurement uncertainty caused by operating under the prior continuing resolution constraints. Looking forward, the White House is scheduled to provide Congress a proposed fiscal year 2016 defense budget next week on February 2. The proposed DoD base budget is widely expected to be higher than the FY'15 level and above the mandated sequestration caps. The higher budget request is in response to increase global security threats and military needs. The FY'16 proposed budget will then undergo congressional deliberation and final spending priorities and funding levels over the coming months. While the impact of the likely higher FY'16 proposed budget on future fiscal years is unclear at this time, a higher FY'16 spending authority could signal bipartisan recognition of the critical need to increase DoD budget levels above the currently constrained limits established by sequestration. These recent budget actions are positive steps in the creation of a more predictable and strategic approach to budget allocations, while addressing the fiscal challenges we face as a nation. I'll now as Bruce to go through the details of fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial performance, our financial outlook for 2015 and then we'll open up the line for your questions. Bruce?
Bruce Tanner: Thanks Marillyn and good morning, everyone. I hope you're all warm and drier this stormy day. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we provided with our earnings release today. Starting with chart three, and an overview of our year-end results, we had a stronger finish to 2014 than we were expecting when we last spoke in October. Sales for the year were $45.6 billion and I'll discuss that in more detail on the next chart. Segment operating margin was 12.3% for the year, about in line with our expectations and the combination of higher sales and segment operating profit drove our earnings per share to $11.21, higher than the guidance we provided in October, but there were two unplanned items that had a net negative impact on the fourth quarter that I'll discuss in a few charts. Cash from operations was nearly $3.9 billion after making $2 billion in pension contributions, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter as we discussed at that time. And finally orders for the fourth quarter were a little higher than expected, resulting in our inning backlog of $80.5 billion. So overall we had a good finish to a strong performance year. On Chart 4, we will discuss our sales results in more detail. In the fourth quarter, sales grew by almost 9% compared to the same period in 2013 with four of the five business areas showing strong growth in the quarter. Aeronautics growth was driven by volume increases on the F-35 production programs. Missiles and Fire Control had higher deliveries of PAC-3 missiles as well as higher tactical missile deliveries, mission systems and training had higher radar volume including the start-up of the Space Fence program and Space Systems grew primarily due to the Orion flight test that occurred in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter performance led to full year of 2014 sales achieving slight growth over the 2013 results. On Chart 5 we will review our earnings per share for the quarter and year. Fourth quarter EPS was $1.32 higher than the prior year, driven primarily by three items. The change in the FAS/CAS adjustment from an expense in 2013 to income in 2014, the absence of the restructuring charges taken in 2013 and a lower goodwill impairment charge in 2014 that occurred in 2013. I'll describe the goodwill impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter in more detail on the next chart. For the year, EPS was more than $2 higher than in 2013, driven again primarily by the FAS/CAS adjustment change in the essence of the restructuring charge in 2014. Turning to Chart 6 to reconcile our actual earnings per share results with the guidance we provided in October. In October we projected our EPS for the year to be around $11.15 per share. And as I mentioned previously, we had two unplanned events that were not considered in the EPS outlook we provided last quarter, the first of which was a special charge we took for goodwill impairment in our tech services line of business. And this was in Fire Control, this chart reduced our EPS by $0.33 and this was the second consecutive year we've had an impairment charge against this business and again reflects both a reduction in support activities in theater, as well as the increased level of competition we're seeing for this business. The second unplanned event was the passage of the R&D tax credit legislation in the quarter, which generated a $0.14 benefit to EPS. These two events lowered our outlook for EPS by $0.19, but were more than offset by the higher sales and segment operating profit in the quarter. Chart 7 provides more detail into our cash deployment actions in 2014 with cash from operations of nearly $3.9 billion and capital expenditure of around $850 million, our free cash flow for the year was a little more than $3 billion and after making dividend payments of nearly $1.8 billion and share repurchases of $1.9 billion, we returned 121% of free cash flow in the year. Over the last 10 years, we've made $30 billion of dividend payments and share repurchases to our shareholders or 108% of free cash flow over that same period. On Chart 8 we show our backlog results of the last four years. Our backlog levels have remained above $80 billion and each of the last four years despite the budgetary pressures that our customers are facing. As has been the case in prior years a strong fourth quarter in 2014 enabled us to achieve these results. Chart 9 provides significant assumptions in our 2015 guidance. Our FAS [audio gap] resulting in the lower discount rate at year end. Asset returns in 2014 of 6% rather than 8% assumed in October make up the remainder of the lower income outlook. While affecting GAAP EPS, these pension changes do not create the need for any additional cash contribution over the next three years. As I noted in the October call, we do not expect to make pension contributions from 2015 through 2017 and our expectations of generating more than $15 million in cash from operations over the next three years remains unchanged. Consistent with our longstanding practice, our guidance does not assume an extension of the R&D tax credit until legislation is enacted. If legislation similar to what was enacted in 2014 is passed in 2015, we would expect the EPS benefit to be comparable to the 2014 amount. And consistent with what we discussed last quarter, we plan to make at least $2 billion in share repurchases in 2015. Turning to chart 10, we provide our current outlook for 2015. Our guidance today is consistent with what we provided in our trend information in October except for the lower FAS/CAS adjustment. We expect both orders and sales to be in a range from $43.5 billion to $45 billion, and we expect our backlog to remain above $80 billion at year-end for the fifth consecutive year. We expect our segment operating profit to be between $5.1 billion and $5.25 billion. Our EPS is expected to be between $10.80 per share and $11.10 per share. And our cash from operations is expected to be greater than $5 billion. Chart 11 shows the ranges for sales and profit by our business areas. And finally, chart 12 is our summary. 2014 was a strong year, both operationally and financially. We are confident that our portfolio has us well-positioned for the future and we remained focused on the cash deployment actions that our shareholders expect. With that we're ready for your questions. Shannon?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] [Audio Gap]
Unidentified Analyst: …And then, it also appears net of disposals that you spent the most on acquisitions this year that you have since 2006. I wonder if you can just provide a little bit more detail on the strategy with regard to R&D, where the spending might be going and how the customer is behaving these days with regard to independent R&D versus them paying for your R&D. And whether we ought to view the acquisitions that you've been making here at late as kind of an extension of R&D. You're acquiring technologies that perhaps you didn't have and where you find the growth areas and just kind of the strategy behind R&D in the acquisitions going forward holistically.
Marillyn Hewson: Sure. Thanks for the question, Jason. I get just first to talk a little bit about R&D and new technology. We have been increasing our R&D expenditures over the past three years. This year we were up -- for 2014 we were up another 8%. And we're doing that because we're not going to cut back on R&D even though that our sales are not growing at the same trajectory that they have maybe for the past decade or so. Because it's really the lifeblood of our company and we are a technology company and we have to continue to invest. From our customers' perspective, we do spend time with our customer on our R&D plans. And lot of credit to Secretary Kendall in bringing us into the Pentagon to talk about our top IRAD expenditures and areas to make sure that we're well aligned with what the priorities are for the Department of Defense. And moreover, as we look at our customers around the world, we're looking at how do we invest in research and development that will allow us to secure new business and to grow our current business. Beyond that we're a long cycle business, so we're constantly looking at how we can continue to invest for the long-term as well. So it's a balance of both of those areas to make sure that we're looking at things that would be giving our allies and our customers an advantage over their adversaries for the long-term. In terms of how we address R&D and cooperative research and development, we kind of look at both of those elements as being an important part of investment, but we also are doing things that are beyond IRAD investment. For example, we use other avenues to develop next generation products and solutions. If you look at what we're doing on the U.S. Air Force's T-X competition that's coming out in 2017, we actually had teamed with South Korea to develop the T-50 supersonic trainer for their air force under an offset program and we're able to take that investment that we made in an offset program and point it toward the T-X competition. So that's a great example of where you might not necessarily see it in the value of an R&D investment that we're making those investments. I think if you look back, years back we did a similar thing on the C-130J which is just paying dividends for us in the markets that we're operating in with the C-130J program where we made investments in our business along that line. Taking it on beyond that into acquisitions, yeah, we did more historically than we have done this year in 2014. There are areas that we're continuing to penetrate into our core, such as our Zeta Associates acquisition and that being very much aligned with our core. Some areas such as the healthcare IT arena and Systems Made Simple is an area that is part of our IT work with the U.S. government where we've been frankly for the past 20 years, the top supplier of IT support, and this is an opportunity for us to bring more to markets like the VA medical, DoD medical, etcetera. The Astrotech acquisition we made in space launch is very much aligned with our core with services there. But then we're also looking at areas to bring in additional capability to the corporation in places where we want to take our core into new markets like [indiscernible] with the IT work we're doing in airports and things along that line. What I will say is that as we've said, we have a very strong cash deployment plan that we're going to follow, but we also are generating cash and we also have a lot of financing capability as a company. That debt capacity allows us to have the flexibility as we see additional opportunities for acquisition that make sense for us that allow us to continue to invest in M&A. So we'll be looking at acquisition that are, as you said, able to add capability, but also ones that open up new markets for us that are closely aligned to our core capabilities.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. You may begin.
Ron Epstein: Yeah. Good morning. Sorry if my connection is a little weak, just working remotely here. Maybe just a follow-up on Jason's question. By my calculations you guys will -- you spent something like 1.5% of sales on R&D, is that enough? When you look at other technology companies, they'll spend multiples of that. I mean how do you think about that, Marillyn?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, I don't think you can look at the absolute dollars, honestly, because I think when you look at our portfolio and when you look at what we've done over the years, it's not a matter of percent of sales so much as it is the efficient expenditure of R&D dollars. So we've made choices in things such as JLTV, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which is a large opportunity that we're pursuing, that hopefully the award later this year will bring to us an opportunity that is a significant new growth market for us. And that started with an acquisition some years ago that brought some technology in and then we built on that technology. So it's not just the dollar level on a percent of sales. And the other thing is, if you look at things that if you look backward -- I mean I don't think we missed anything in terms of our portfolio and things that we have won because we have and invested in research and development for the long-term.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. You may begin.
Pete Skibitski: Good morning, guys.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning, Pete.
Pete Skibitski: Maybe one for Bruce. Bruce, I was wondering if you could help us again, maybe update us like you did in the last quarter on the cash from ops and bridge from '14 to '15. Just because it looks like maybe cash taxes were a little higher than expected in '14. You've got obviously zero pension cash needs in '15. It seems like maybe $5 billion is good as it is, might even be conservative. Can you help us understand why that could be what you do?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. So, Pete, let me try that. I tried to give some of this in the October call, but I think it's probably worth repeating just to make sure everyone is on the same page. So, I think the simple math would say you did $3.9 billion in 2014; you did $2 billion of pension contribution. It seems like you should be around $5.9 billion versus the $5 billion. I think there’s kind of two or three pieces, probably two that drive most of that. One is we have additional -- because of the $1 billion contribution made at the end of the year '14, we're going to get actually tax deductions worth about $350 million in '14 that won't carry over into 2015. We also had in '14 a tax refund of about $0.25 billion, so $250-ish million or so I think was the number. So that's what $600 million or so, a sort of bridge from just a cash taxes, if you will, either refunds or cash out for taxes. And then the last thing, if you just look at our -- at the level of income that we're projecting from 2014 and 2015, we're down a couple hundred million dollars, so if you just translate those earnings into cash that pretty much makes up the difference about $900 million. And again, I'll remind you, Pete, we keep saying we're expecting to be a little greater than $5 billion and I think that potential is still there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Safran of Buckingham Research. You may begin.
Bruce Tanner: Rich, you there?
Operator: Rich, your line is open. Please check your mute button.
Jerry Kircher: Shannon, let's move to the next one.
Operator: Our next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin.
Carter Copeland: Hi. Good morning, all.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Carter Copeland: Marillyn, I really appreciate the comments on international post your visit, but I wondered if you might give us a little bit more color about how you think about how much of your business is those sort of core strategic capabilities that you're delivering to those customers versus the stuff that is perhaps more support oriented or perhaps commoditized in some way. Is there a way to kind of rack and stack your international business and say this portion applies to the key capabilities like THAAD and PAC-3 and the like? And how should we think about that?
Marillyn Hewson: So, I'd say first off that the key areas of growth for us internationally are certainly in the missile defense area in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Just as you mentioned, it's THAAD, its Aegis, Aegis Ashore, Patriot, potentially MEADS we hope to sell in addition to that F-35. I mean those are core and that's the majority of our growth in the international. It's our core business that we're growing. Now we are having some additional areas of growth and things like cyber, which is an expansion of work that we've been doing for years for the U.S. government that we're able to grow into other areas; our IT work. But the big dollar items within our growth in international are core business that we have, C-130Js, continue to sell F-16, the air and missile defense, the U.K. turret for the scout vehicle and for warrior, things of that nature. Hopefully that answers your question, Carter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Noah Poponak: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Noah.
Noah Poponak: I wanted to ask about two bigger programs, new programs on mature computing and just kind of get a broad update from you. Maybe on LRSP, I was specifically wondering if you could talk about work with theoretic will be done and if capacity were need to be added. And then, if there's anywhere as well update on JLTV and on that one if you could potentially size what that could ultimately be for the company if there as a win. Thanks.
Marillyn Hewson: Well, first of all, LRSP I can tell you that we're teamed with Boeing. We think we have a very strong position on that program and pursing it, and there'll be a word sometime this year and that's all about I can tell you about them. I'm sorry, but that's that all I can say. In regard to JLTV, it’s a very significant opportunity for us. The RFP is out; our proposals are due early in February. And the award for that is projected again this year, we think mid-year, we don't know. Our guess is as good as yours as which quarter because as we know a lot of times protest immerge and things of that nature. But in terms of the program itself, it’s a big opportunity for us. Bruce, in terms of size I think you go ahead.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. I think, Noah, the -- I think the RFP came out and there's they're asking for various production quantities over various years, sort of the stated number of vehicles is somewhere around 17,000 vehicles and you can probably do the math as well as anyone as far as what that total production program would be for. But it’s -- we should think about it as a multi-billion dollar sort of award for the initial proposal which is the development program in the first few LRIP contracts. And then it's got potential obviously well beyond that for both additional domestic vehicles as well as the international market place. So this is although the initial award that we're expecting to have happened this year hopefully without protest pushing it out is not all that sizable. The strategic opportunity is very great.
Marillyn Hewson: I could add on that one where we're going to produce it going to you talk about that. So it's in Camden Arkansas we have facility there where just this past year we went through the production readiness review with the U.S. Government and it was very successful and so we're excited about the opportunity on the JLTV.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. You may begin.
Doug Harned.: Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Hi Doug. Good morning.
Doug Harned.: I am interested in your thoughts around how you work with the changing budget, by that I mean if you look forward, we're at a point where their prospects for arising budget, arising base budget certainly, but at the same time, we're seeing the end of a lot of operational activity in theater that's been going on for many years. So when you look at this how do you think about your exposure to some of the con ops that have been going on? Is there much left and where is it and then at the same time, how do you think about investing where there is going to be growth and not just R&D, but BMT, potentially facilities. How do you manage this transition?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question Doug. I would say that we spent a lot of time on our strategic planning as a company and keep a beat on what’s happening in the environment that we're operating in and we look both and where the opportunity are relative to growth in the DoD budget as well as you know our focus on the international market place. And we look at you know the -- sure there is a draw down in regions where we're bringing our war fighters home and that has some impact on things like our services business and things of that nature. But where the real opportunities for ours are is to not only continue to grow with the F-35 program, which today represents 17% of our sales and will continue to grow to a larger percentage in 2015 and beyond. As we just talked about, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, JLTV is the big opportunity for us. We're looking forward to C-130J multiyear opportunity really to our combat ship and as the U.S. Navy moves forward with their 52 ship buy on the small surface combatant, so going beyond the current Littoral combat ship, those are all areas for growth. And as we -- we believe that we do have the strongest portfolio. So we're constantly looking at as the U.S. Government determines where they have to recapitalize, then can't sit still either even though in this current timeframe may be the situation in terms of a war environment is not as high. Will they use up a lot of aircraft and a lot of systems and vehicles in those wars and they've got to recapitalize and when we believe we're well positioned to take advantage of that because we are continuing to focus on providing greater capability and new technology and take an advantage of that advanced technology. So that’s where our R&D, our bid proposal etcetera, on facilities we have looked at how we take capacity out. We've taken out over seven million square feet of capacity since 2009, but at the same time, we've opened some new labs, we've opened up some new areas. So I think what we try to do is adjust our capacity to not only the business space, but to the areas where we need to invest to continue to grow as a business. So I think we do a good job of assessing the changes in the environment that we're operating in and we adjust our facilities, our investments and our pursuit of acquisitions and research and development funding accordingly.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Sam Pearlstein: Good morning. I wanted to actually somewhat follow-up on that last question, which is the guidance has top-lined down in 2015 a few percent at the midpoint. You did make some 900 million worth of acquisition. So I guess first part, which is what is the organic sales trend in 2015, and also given budget trends, can you see positive year-over-year sales in 2016 at this point and if not, what does it take to get there.
Bruce Tanner: Hi Sam. I’ll take that one on. So you're right, we talked about roughly $900 million in acquisitions in the year. I think the inorganic growth in the year 2014 was about a little less than $250 million. And you should think of that growing to about three quarters of a billion dollar or so, about a $0.5 billion increase in inorganic growth year-over-year from '14 to '15. So that’s sort of where we see that playing out there. I think it's important to note that in our planning of 2015 and what we've talked about up to this point is all based on the current Budget Control Act without consideration of what Marillyn was talking about in her opening remarks about the potential increase in the FY '16 budget. As we look at that, the interesting thing, and I know, I've talked to you guys about this in some of the investor conferences, I think the interesting thing is not necessarily what happens with the FY '16, it's what happens with the budget beyond FY '16 because if you just get the spike in FY '16 and then you go back down to the Budget Control Act, you really go back down to levels that cause an elaboration in '16 and then you're back square one in FY '17 and beyond and it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense from a strategic planning perspective. I'll say even with that scenario, again we don’t have either spike in FY '16 in our planning outlook, nor do we have anything in FY '17 and beyond. We do believe, we will start to see growth in FY '16 and particularly within the aeronautics business areas where we're expecting to see growth and I'll say, as I sit here today Sam, I feel pretty comfortable actually saying we're going to see some growth -- organic growth starting in FY '16 or 2016 above the 2015 level. And at least our planning, Sam, for years beyond '16 assumes that that growth continues. So we're sitting actually looking forward to that with the potential for hopefully some good news coming out of the budget -- the President's budget process in the not too distant future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. You may begin.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Good morning. Its [indiscernible] for Rob Stallard.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: Marillyn, I was wondering if I could follow up on Carter’s question and your comments about visiting the region last year. You made a lot of investments there, which very much you mentioned at Masdar as well as [indiscernible]. Is your sense in talking to your customers there that the current energy prices going to have any impact on the pace at which export contracts could be awarded in the medium term.
Marillyn Hewson: Well we're really not seeing any pull back on their expenditures on national security, because that in terms of their priority, that's very important and it's true that for a lot of our key countries, that's an important source of revenue for them. But when you look at countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and others, they have very substantial government reserves and so what they're looking at -- as long as the prices don’t stay down for a long extended time, which none of us know how that will play out, but we've not seen anything that would impact our portfolio and what we bring. So no change so far on their critical means, they still have -- they will operate in dangerous neighborhoods and they still have needs for missile defense and tactical aircraft and range of communications systems. Perhaps there may be some pressure on some of our less priority programs such as IT upgrades, or services, or things of that nature, but in terms of the big ticket items and the items that I am having the dialogue with them about it has not come up. I think they're very much focused on their highest priority requirements and those happened to be the things that we can bring to them as we move forward.
Operator: Thank you our next question from David Strauss of UBS. You may begin.
David Strauss: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning.
David Strauss: What specifically with F-35 program, it looks like last year you had about an $800 million increase in sales, but no increase in prop as it relates to the production program. Can you talk about what you got baked into your number this year some up any sort of EBITDA increase out of production program. And then second question Bruce can you talk about the advanced line, I think it was like about $500 million drag, can you just talk about the outlook for advance systems here? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: So David, I think your map is pretty accurately. We were a little bit flat. I am just looking at some numbers here in terms of the production program. We actually had a overall profit actually -- let me just take a peak here. Overall profit actually was up slightly on the F-35 program in total, the production program and that’s primarily because of the lack of the SPD write-off that we took in 2013. But the production program was fairly flat in terms of total profit dollars and actually the margin was down. I think that’s the point that you're have talking at. We had some step ups on the production early contracts in 2013. We had some planned step-ups in 2014, some of which we took, but not all of which that we had planned did we take in 2014. So that got pushed off to the right and that caused the situation that you're describing in 2014. As we look forward to 2015, I am still expecting and I know we've talked about this as recently as the Investor Conference we had in Fort Worth. I am still expecting a 100 basis points or more improvement in the F-35 production program margins between 2014 and 2015. And we're hopeful that that trend will continue at least year-over-year sequential increase in the margins on the production program in years thereafter, but the biggest spike we're expecting is between 2014 and 2015. And I think a big reason for that maybe -- we closed the year pretty strong from a production perspective on the F-35 program. We had a month -- almost a two-month delay in production activities or at least delivery of the aircraft because of the engine anomaly that occurred in 2014. Yet we made all 36 aircraft delivers. We actually had a chance to exceed that number. So I think as we closed out the year, things were looking and feeling better on the production program than say when we started the year and I am hopeful that that trend will continue into 2015 and that’s what we're banking on with that margin increase. On the customer advances, that I think the actually burn is about -- we're expecting it to go down about another couple $100 million or so. You're right, it was down about a $0.5 billion from '13 to '14. Some of that is simply the nature of -- we're actually seeing a little bit of conversion from and I think we've talked about this from some of our direct commercial sales contracts to more and more FMS contracts that tend to get negotiated concurrently with the U.S. Government buys. We're seeking that for instance on the F-35 program with aircraft and we're seeing that also on a lot of missile program be they Hellfire missile, [indiscernible] PAC-3 and the like. So a lot of the -- a lot of the historical and this is just in large part due to the customer change, but a large part because of the F-35 growth, which is all going to be FMS in the near term. We're seeing some burn down of sort of the legacy, direct commercial sales. It has not been replaced by new commercial sales down payments in part because those are in fact FMS contract. Kind of long-winded answer to that question, David. Hope that makes sense for you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. You may begin.
Joe DeNardi: Yes thanks. I guess just another one on the F-35 if you could just kind of talk about what caused some of those step up to get pushed out of 2014 and how the budget outlook for that program, which seems to be improving kind of plays into how do you think about the margin profile improving on the production side?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, so Joe, I’ll take that one as well. So we always go through at every year thinking that there is a planned level of booking rates and especially on programs that are early in their life cycle as is the F-35. And in 2014, we had planned to have some increases on the production program and again for the reasons that I described to David, some of that were simply in the early part of the year it made no sense whatsoever to have margin increases when we're actually sitting ideal because of the engine anomaly. And that did cause some disruption overall to the performance at about first half of the year leaking into the second half of the year and so that caused some of those increases to get pushed out just as I described. That's the reason I was making the point. I think where we ended the year was a good point for us on the production programs. And that does give us the confidence that 2015 you will see those step ups made. And that's the reason for the margin improvement that I talked about with David. And again, our expectation is a little bit spiky from '14 to '15 in terms of a pretty good sized jump in the margins on the production program, but thereafter we continue to expect that margin to increase year-over-year as we go through the production program.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. You may begin.
Joe Nadol: Thanks. Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Joe.
Joe Nadol: Hi. So, on Aeronautics F-35, I was wondering, Bruce, if you might give little bit of an update. Obviously, we had our meeting a couple months ago in Fort Worth, but just little update on where you stand on deliveries this year for -- specifically for F-16 and C-130. And then, key pursuits, little bit about the multi-year in particular on the C-130 side. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. Thanks, Joe. So let me give you just sort of a -- may be a long-winded answer to the question. So F-16 deliveries -- I think to keep this up in the past, we're going to drop -- I think I keep this up in the October call. We had about 17 -- not about, we had 17 aircraft deliveries for the F-16 program in 2014. We're building about one a month, you should think of it. So we're looking at about 11 or 12 deliveries probably in 2015. I think current contract schedule would consist of 11 aircraft there. On the C-130, we're at a pretty steady build rate between years. We did 24 aircrafts in 2014. We would expect to do 24 aircrafts in 2015 as well. And that's -- again that's the expectation. That's sort of a good build rate. In fact; we'd prefer to sort of build with that steady rate as oppose to having sort of spikes that would cause us to have a little bit of disruption. We'd rather build at that steady rate. And with the backlog that we have in the program, we're able to do that. C-130 multi-year, so we got I'd say some partial funding on that at the end of 2014, and we expect to close the rest of that, the balance of that in 2015, but the value is not as large as it was at the end of the year, the sort of partial funding, on a fiscal year basis towards that multi-year. Joe, maybe inherent in the question -- I'm sorry, I didn't talk about the F-35 program. So we did 36 aircraft deliveries in 2014. That number is going to increase probably in the 40, maybe a couple more than that. We're actually working with the joint program office later in the month of February to sort of finalize the production delivery plans. And we do that because it actually does require resources on both sides, both the government resources as well as company resources to do this. So we'll have a better idea and more definitive idea of the F-35 deliveries next -- probably next time we talk to you in April. But I would expect that we'll be somewhere in again the 40, may be a couple more than that as we said here today. And then the last aircraft program I guess for the Aeronautics business area, we delivered seven C5s in 2014, we expect that number to go up to nine deliveries. And I think we stayed at about that level probably until the program winds down through the last delivery of the C5 modernization program. One thing while we're talking aircrafts and deliveries and quantities, Joe, I want to make sure that everyone understands as at least we look at sort of the phasing of our revenue in 2015 it's going to be bit on an odd year. We're very, very heavily weighted in the second half. The first quarter, in particular, is very unusually low, or we expect it to be very unusually low on a compare basis because of our delivery phasing. And that's both associated with the Aeronautics aircraft that I just talked about. I think we've got two fewer F-16s in the first quarter and two fewer C-130s both in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. But combined that with the fact that Missiles and Fire Control is going to have a pretty significant drop off in the first quarter of deliveries of their missile programs, both tactile missiles, PAC-3s and the like. We could see the first quarter revenue being down as much as say 5% year-over-year compared to the first quarter of 2014. And then, obviously, it will build from that point on to the levels that we're seeing for the full year for 2015, so a little bit of an unusual pattern for us. We always have the pattern where the fourth quarter is higher than the rest, but we're starting off 2015, our least expectation probably a little lower than it ordinarily would.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
Myles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Myles Walton: First of all is a clarification. I might have missed it, but the international sales in 2014, I think the last two years have been about 17% of sales, but you can just give that number for '14. And then, Marillyn, as you look at the Middle East as kind of a customer base and you think about the threats that exist there, that's one aspect, but the foreign policy and what we choose to do there is another. Just hypothetical if the U.S. does move more towards the normalization with Iran over the nuclear activities, does that in any way impede which you see as progress not for our military sales-front there from a dealer's perspective. Thanks.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Myles. Well, first an answer to your question, we achieved 20% of our total sales of an international sales in 2014. So we're pleased with that and we have over $20 billion in our backlog at year-end of that. We've set a new goal to get 25% over the next few years. Our growing international area is an important element of our strategy and growth for the company, and we see a lot of expanding demand for international growth, expanding demand on missile defense, on aircraft programs on a range of things. To your question about foreign policy and normalization and things of that nature, in my discussion with our customers that really isn't coming up. I mean it's very clear to the Middle East region that that dialogue is going on. But, front and center for them are the needs they have today, what their critical national requirements are today. So, our discussion is that -- is around those national security needs that they have and there're certainly plenty of threat in the region. Just the volatility, even if there're maybe some kind of deal done with Iran, there is volatility all around the region. And each one of these countries believes they've got to protect their citizens and the things that we can bring to them help in that regard. So similarly, that's the Middle East and I know that's what you asked about, but you could take that same argument to the Asia-Pacific region, which is another growth area for us. A lot of volatility, a lot of instability, a lot of things that are happening both with North Korea as well as some of the tension between China and Japan and -- so in both of those regions which are growth areas for us we expect that there's going to continue to be opportunities for us to bring our capabilities to them.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. You may begin.
George Shapiro: Yeah. Bruce, I noticed that all the margins that you project for '15 in each of the sectors are down relative to '14. Now, Aero is explainable with mix, space maybe explainable with less venture income. But can you go through why they are down in all the other sectors? And if you could maybe lay out what you think would be kind of the normalized number that we'd wind up reaching in terms of these margins, because it will be the second year that we'll have seen a decline.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. George, I'll try to take a shot at. That’s a good question. So, even though you kind of gave the answer for a couple, I'll go ahead and try to hit all five business areas from my perspective, maybe from what we're seeing in 2015 and then sort of a longer term view. So, Aeronautics in '15 in part because of all the discussion we've had up to this point on the F-35 production part and the fact we expect to see some increases there. F-15 -- 2015 is really looking fairly comparable from margin perspective for Aeronautics. Longer term, we've talked about the fact that as F-35 increases, even in the scenario that I described with year-over-year margin increases, those will still be lower than the composite average margin for Aeronautics, if you will. So that will still be dilutive just because of the growth of the F-35 program. And that's what we expect to see their longer term. Missiles and Fire Control is may be slightly lower, but -- than 2015, but I'll say that's probably pretty comparable when you look at it big picture wise and we still think we have some of the same opportunities in 2015 as we had in 2014. Longer term, I would expect some reduction in higher margin business that we've got there particularly if we're successful for instance winning the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, you would expect us to have that program start off at a lower booking rate than some of our legacy long production programs, long production missile programs, out of missiles in Fire Control. And so I would expect to see again longer term some reduction in the margins in missiles and fire control from the level we experienced in '14 and probably '15 as well. Mission Systems and Training is down slightly in '15 compared to '14. You should think of that really primarily as a result of new program starts. So programs like Space Fence, like the combat rescue helicopter, like the new presidential helicopter; those are all early starts on larger programs that are actually driving a lot of the organic growth of MST there. And that's coming with lower margins than some of their heritage production programs just like I talked about on Missiles and Fire Control. There is also within MST in 2015, some of the last of the restructuring charges that remember we talked about in 2013, we took the severance charges, but there were still ongoing restructuring charges for things like facility closures and facilities rearrangements and so forth. There is about $20 million or so higher restructuring cost in MST in 2015 or 2014. So that's putting a little bit of pressure there. Longer term, I think it's going to be fairly comparable to where we end up 2015, maybe a little bit higher if some of that restructuring expense goes away and hopefully we start to have some increases on some of those early program starts that I talked about. IS&GS we teed up in the October call that we thought it would be down about 30 basis points or so from 2014 to 2015 and I describe that as about half of that just being sort of the increased level of competition, recompute, disaggregation, breaking down contracts and so forth. And the other half of that 30 basis points was we changed some of the backlog with an IS&GS to have an number of longer term international programs that extend over multiple years a little bit different than sort of the heritage IS&GS business and those were starting off just as any new program with lower overall margins of the composite and that was sort of the other half of the 30 basis points that we talked about. So if you rewind back to the end of the October call, it would have said, we should be looking at probably somewhere in the 87-88 range for margins at ISGS. We're little lower than that and all of that George is because of the transaction expenses associated with the acquisition we made at the of last year for systems made simple. So that's bringing another 30 basis points or so reduction to IS&GS' overall margin. So while that acquisition is EPS dilutive, it is actually cash accretive in year one. So that's something we're happy to take those charges and again longer term, for IS&GS is that as those transactions cost start to play out, expect to see some slight increases in the IS&GS profitability margin levels from where we are today. In Space, you talked about -- the earlier earnings we teed that up in the October call that the equity earnings associated with the United launch alliance are down pretty considerably. In 2014 versus 2015 a lot of those is just the mix of the launch vehicles we have there and that's driving the biggest single piece of that. The other piece that may not be evident again is we also made couple of acquisitions for data and the satellite processing business that we acquired last year. Those also are bringing transaction expenses in 2015 that were not in 2014. You should think of that as about a 20 basis point or so impact in the margins of space systems company in 2015. And just as I described on the systems made simple or the acquisition for IS&GS, while they are a little bit EPS dilutive in 2015, both of those acquisitions are cash accretive in 2015. So we're happy with that. Longer term, for Space Systems, I think we get back at about the 12% margin, we're a little bit like to that in 2014, but as some of these -- again transaction expenses go down and by the way some of the restructuring cost that we have in Space System start to wind down, I think you'll see the overall margins getting back to sort of a normal run rate with the ULA equity earnings at about the 12% level.
Jerry Kircher: Shannon, this is Jerry. I think we've run over the hour a little bit. So I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for final comments.
Marillyn Hewson: Sure. Thanks Jerry. I just want to wrap up the call by again saying that the corporation achieved another excellent year in 2014 and we continue to be well positioned to deliver substantial value to our customers and our stockholders as we moved strongly in 2015. So thanks again for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking to you again in our next earnings call in April. Shannon that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day. And welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you, Shannon, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. As we review our financial results and key accomplishments in the quarter, as well as provide a brief update on some of our strategic initiatives. As today’s release detailed, we continue to drive towards achievement of our full year goal with another quarter of solid operational and financial results. Although, we continue to face global economic challenges, these results reflect the execution across all of our businesses as the Corporation continues to operate a very strong level in returning value to stockholders, while providing critical solutions to our customers. The daily focus and efforts of our team are the foundation of our ability to deliver broad-base results across the Corporation and I thank them for their ongoing contributions. Turning to our financials, while, Bruce, will cover the results in detail later, I want to particularly highlight our continued exceptional cash generation. This quarter we achieved approximately $1 billion in cash from operations, bringing our September year-to-date cash generation to over $4 billion. Strong cash generation is a longstanding hallmark of our Corporation and continues to be a differentiator, as we return cash to stockholder through dividends and share repurchases, while also making appropriate investments in the business. Our strong and growing cash generation enabled by our Board of directors, enabled them to approve two key cash actions this past quarter. First, we increased our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share and $6 annually. This action represents the 12th consecutive year that our dividend rate has been increased by double-digit percentages. Second, we also increased our share repurchase authority by $2 billion, bringing our total current share repurchase authority to almost $4 billion and providing additional flexibility to continue to make future share repurchases. Beyond the Board actions, we recently completed our Annual Financial Planning process and projections of future financial metrics. I’m excited about the robust cash generation that the plan projects going forward and our ability to implement strong actions to deploy cash back to stockholders. In light of our future projected cash flows, we are implementing a new cash deployment initiative in which we anticipate reducing our total outstanding share count to below 300 million shares over the next three years. Share repurchases of this magnitude, coupled with our dividend payments would results in our returning vast majority of annual free cash to stockholders over the next three years and continue our longstanding strategy of disciplined cash deployment and value creation for stockholders. Moving to operations, while numerous mission success events were achieved across the Corporation, I want to highlight two major events achieved by our Space Systems business. In September, our team successfully inserted the Maven spacecraft into orbit around Mars. Space Systems constructed the spacecraft for NASA and also provides flight operations control of the vehicle as it surveys the upper atmosphere of Mars. These surveys will provide vital data to scientist seeking to understand how the loss of atmospheric gas to space changed the Martian climate and potentially provide valuable insight into atmospherics dynamics here on earth. Another area where key accomplishments were achieved by space is on the Orion program. This quarter the inaugural spacecraft was successfully fueled at the Kennedy Space Center and its progressing towards integration with the Delta IV launch vehicle in November. The program continues to progress and it’s in the final stages of preparation for its initial unmanned test flight scheduled later this year in December. Orion remains an essential national asset in returning capability of manned access to space to our nation in the coming years. We are proud to be serving as the prime contractor on this program and progressing on this critical capability for NASA and our country. I’d like to briefly switch to our international activities and provide an update on noteworthy achievements in this strategically important area. Progress this quarter was seen both in new strategic partnerships and new business awards. In the area of new international partnerships, we opened a new Space Technology Office in the United Kingdom. This office will expand our in-country relationships with U.K. companies, government agencies and universities. We are looking forward to applying our 50-year heritage of Space Systems expertise to develop opportunities in environmental monitoring, space exploration, global security and secure space communications. And we also opened a new space object tracking site in Australia to construct a more detailed picture of space debris for both government and commercial customers. This site will use electro optical technologies and will compliment radar tracking systems such as the U.S. Air Force’s Space Fence program that we were awarded last quarter. Beyond our footprint expansion initiatives, new business awards from international customers this quarter included receipt of an $800 million contract from the Australian Department of Defense to develop a centralized information processing environment. This program will significantly improve the efficiency of data delivery by consolidating the department’s 280 data centers into 14. Additionally, we were very pleased that the Republic of Korea finalized its formal selection of the F-35 for their fighter replacement program and have announced their intent to sign a Letter of Offer and Acceptance between the United States and Korean governments for 40 F-35 aircraft. This program is valued at nearly $7 billion for aircraft and associated support activities. These recent actions and awards are representative of the growing level of activity that our international strategic initiatives are generating. I’m pleased to report that we are projecting achievement of 20% of international sales content by the end of this year, achieving a goal we outlined to you a few years ago. Growth in international business content is an essential element in our ability to generate future sales for the Corporation. Projected international sales growth will help offset the impact of U.S. government budget pressures on domestic sales levels. With growing international demand expected for our products, such as the F-35 fighter and missile defense systems, I’m increasingly confident that our annual international sales content could increase to 25% or higher in the next few years. Before turning the call over to Bruce, I wish to note that we are very proud to have recently been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and to two carbon disclosure project Climate Change Management Indices. We are the only U.S. aerospace and defense company to earn a spot on the world index. And our CDP awards mark the fourth consecutive year our Corporation has been recognized for exceptional performance. These prestigious awards reflect our continuing pursuit of sustainable practices through innovation, transparency and sound governance. They also reflect the broad commitment of our workforce that help engineer a better tomorrow. I’ll now ask Bruce to go through the details of third quarter and full year financial performance and our 2015 financial trend preview. And then we’ll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce Tanner: Thank you, Marilyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included in our earnings release today. Let's start with chart three, an overview of the quarter. As I’m sure, you’re aware, shortly after the second quarter earnings call, The Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 or HATFA was enacted. And because this legislation extended the methodology for determining discount rates used for pension contributions established by the MAP-21 Legislation in 2012, it will have a significant impact on our results for the quarter, the year and longer term as well. We’ll describe the impact this had in the quarter below. I will also spend quite a bit of time in upcoming charts describing these future impacts to you. Sales in the quarter were $11.1 billion in line with our expectations, though down slightly from last year. Segment operating profit was also as expected at $1.3 billion with our segment operating margin remaining strong at 12.1%. Our net earnings from continuing operations increased 5% to $888 million. And this is where we first see the impacts of the HATFA legislation. The effect of the legislation lowers our FAS/CAS income for the year by slightly more than $70 million and requires a retroactive adjustment in the third quarter amounting to $55 million or $35 million in net earnings. Without this adjustment, net earnings would have increased by 10% to $923 million. We’ll see the remainder of the $70 million adjustment in the fourth quarter. Our earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7% to $2.76 in the quarter. And again these results were dampened by the impacts of the HATFA legislation in the quarter, which amounted to $0.11 of earnings per share. Without this retroactive adjustment, our EPS in the quarter would have been $2.87, up 12% in the quarter. Our cash from operations continues to be very strong with just under $1 billion generated in the quarter stronger than we’d expected. So I think we had another solid quarter results and we’re well positioned to finish the year consistent with our guidance. If you’ll turn to chart four, we’ll highlight just how strong our cash from operations has been this year. Our cash generated in the quarter was almost a $1 billion and this represents a 10% increase over our level from a year ago. And on a year-to-date basis, our results were even stronger with $4.1 billion generated in the first three quarters, up 13% over the comparable time period last year. Chart five shows our cash deployment actions through the third quarter with dividends to-date of almost $1.3 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.7 billion. We’ve returned nearly $3 billion to shareholders through the first three quarters, representing 82% of our free cash flow for the same timeframe. And as Marillyn said in her remarks, we also increased our dividend in the quarter at 13%, the 12th consecutive year, we have increased our dividend level by 10% or greater. This payout level begins with our fourth quarter dividend. On chart six, we’ll explain the impacts of the HATFA legislation enactment in more detail. As I mentioned earlier, the legislation was enacted after the July earnings release and in simple terms, it impacts us by extending the methodology used to determine discount rates for ERISA contributions that was put in place with the MAP-21 legislation. That methodology was an attempt to recognize the unprecedented low interest environment we were experiencing, which would have required making significant cash contributions to pension plans. The impact of the MAP-21 methodology decreases each year and would have phased out by 2016. Under HATFA, this methodology will now be extended so that it will begin to decrease in 2018 and phase out by 2021. It has the effect of lowering CAS cost as well as ERISA contributions from what they otherwise would have been, had MAP-21 not been extended. As you will see the impacts of these changes are somewhat mixed. They result in reduced pension funding requirements in the near term but also low recovery of pension contributions as it lowers our CAS cost in the near term. And while lowering near-term CAS cost improves our overall competitiveness and lowers the required level of customer funding, it also will lower our reported earnings per share in the near term. I’ll get into more specific detail of these impacts on the next page but overall we think these changes provide relatively neutral economic impact while having a negative impact on near-term GAAP earnings. Chart seven provides more detail into how the HATFA changes will affect our pension recovery and funding requirements over the next three years. And these projections are based on the underlying assumptions for our pension plan as shown on chart 14 in our appendix web charts. Focusing on the column labeled before HATFA, we were expecting to recover more than $7 billion through our CAS pricing between 2015 and 2017. We also would have had $3.5 billion in required contributions over that same period resulting in a net $3.8 billion in pre-tax pension cash recoveries. As you can see in the column labeled after HATFA, we now expect to have CAS pension receipts of $5.8 billion while reducing our required pension contributions to $1 billion over this time period resulting in a net $4.8 billion in pre-tax pension recoveries. As you’ll see in a couple of charts, we intend to make this required $1 billion contribution in the fourth quarter of 2014, creating a three-year pension funding holiday and allowing additional cash deployment opportunities to shareholders over the next three years. The bottom two bullets on the chart describe what these changes mean relative to approximately $10 billion of pension pre-funding amount. By 2017, we will have recovered just under $5 billion of that amount and by 2020, we will have recovered a total of just over $8 billion. With this level of pension recoveries, we would expect our cash from operations to be greater than or equal to $15 billion over the 2015 to 2017 timeframe. On chart eight, we provided our updated outlook for 2014. We’re maintaining our orders outlook for the year while we’re ahead of our orders planned for the first three quarters. We have the large C-130J multiyear order planned in the fourth quarter which could slip into 2015. We’re providing point estimates for those sales and segment operating profit as we’re increasingly comfortable with our ability to achieve these levels. And both of these are above the midpoints of our prior guidance. We also provided our usual sales and segment operating profit outlooks by business area in the appendix to our web charts today. Our FAS/CAS pension income is lower by about $70 million as previously discussed. But we now expect our other unallocated expenses to be lower by similar amount resulting in $5.6 billion of operating profit. We are now guiding our earnings per share to the high end of our previous guidance at $11.15 per share which includes the negative impact of $0.14 per HATFA. And with the additional $1 billion contribution to our pension trust this year, our cash from operations is now expected to be greater than or equal to $3.8 billion. On chart nine, we provide our preliminary look at our 2015 financial trends. We expect our 2015 sales level will decline by a low single digit rate from our expected 2014 level, a little lower than we previously expected. We had previously thought 2014 would represent the trough year of sequestration’s effect on our topline. But that has now moved out a year as we continue to see downward pressure primarily in our services businesses. We expect our segment operating margin will remain strong at between 11.5% and 12%. Our FAS/CAS pension income rose to about $650 million in 2015, after the affects of the HATFA legislation. And assuming the discount rate remains at 4.25% at year-end 2014, our return on asset is 8% in 2014 and based on the additional $1 billion in incremental pension funding in the fourth quarter of 2014. Again, that would allow for no required pension contributions from 2015 to 2017. Beyond 2015, with these same assumptions for our discount rate and return on assets, we would expect FAS/CAS income to continue to grow to about a $1 billion in 2016 and $1.5 billion by 2017. And because we are eliminating our previously plan $1 billion pension contribution in 2015, we anticipate increasing our share repurchases to at least $2 billion, about a $1 billion more than the level required to offset the amount of share creep expected during the year. This would be a good start reducing our share count level below 300 million share amount within the next three years that Marilyn mentioned earlier. Finally on chart 10, we have our summary. Our third quarter and year-to-date performance continues to be very solid. Our results leave us well-positioned to achieve the full year guidance we provided and we continue our long-standing commitment to returning cash to our shareholders. With that, we are ready for your questions? Shannon?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin.
Carter Copeland - Barclays: Hey. Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Carter Copeland - Barclays: A couple of quick ones. Just first on the sustainment weakness you called out in Aeronautics in the quarter. I wondered if you might give us some color about what that related to and whether that was tied to in-theater operations or something else.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. I will take that one, Carter. So the sustainment weakness in aero was really, I think of it is as predominantly F-16 or little bit in our Kelly business as well. The F-16, you should think of a couple of things going on there. We have a couple of large international F-16 month programs that are starting, but they started later than we had anticipated or they will start later in one case than we anticipated. And while we previously kind of expected to have some existing older mod programs, sort of feather end to these newer mod programs, we now have a bit of lowering point or a trough before we start to see the new programs pick up speed and that’s what’s driving the numbers stand a little bit in F-16. On the other hand for the F-22 program, this is a bit of good news, can also be bad news in some respects. We provide the sustainment of the F-22 aircraft in the field, and the aircraft are actually performing better than our expectation and I believe better than the customers’ expectations. And so because of that because our readiness levels and the like are higher than we expected them to be at this point in time were actually seeing a diminished level of spares requirement, another sustainment activity to support the aircraft at that level. So while that’s terrific news for our products, terrific news for our customers, does result in a little bit of lower sales for us in 2015 than we previously planned.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gursky of Citi. You may begin.
Jason Gursky - Citi: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Hey Bruce, the question for you on the cash flow outlook over the next three years. You are going to do $3.8 billion this year which includes roughly $2 billion dollars in pension contributions that won't be there in the ‘15 through ’17 period. That would suggest on average $5.8 billion and yet you are guiding on average $5 billion in cash flows, ’15 through ’18. Can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes that are going on with cash flow? Where might we really come on to or where we might we go over?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. Let me try to take a shot at that, Jason. So, I think you are -- the back of the envelope math you did would be exactly right. $3 billion with $2 billion pension contribution why wouldn’t that equal $5.8 billion next year? So the short version answer to that is, think of that as primarily cash taxes. So the additional $1 billion that we are contributing in 2014 think about as about a $350 million swing that we won't get that tax deduction, if you will in 2015 and somewhat seems over at this point in time. But we also had a tax refund in the first quarter of this year about $250 million. So between the two of those, think of that as what $600 million-ish or so. I think we’ve -- the one thing I would add that may help little bit in discussion also is while we are saying greater than or equal to $15 billion, we do expect 2015 cash flow to start with a $5 billion obviously at this point in time. But I would expect that year-over-year our cash from operations would actually increase over that number between ’15, ’16 and ’17. So we are actually feeling good about the statement of greater than or equal to $15 billion.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Safran from Buckingham Research. You may begin.
Rich Safran - Buckingham Research: Hi. Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Rich Safran - Buckingham Research: Let me ask you a different sort of question on cash flow here. Marillyn, I heard your opening remarks, may just want to get a little specific. Previously your stated goal was to return 50% of cash to shareholders. I recognized you’ve been doing more than that but the $2 billion in share repurchases on the slide, plus the dividend indicates now you're looking closer towards 100%, assuming my math is correct here. So, I want to know if I’m thinking about this right and does it represent a change in your cash deployment strategy? Should we be thinking now that you are going to return more like 100% of free cash flow to shareholders?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, you’ve got the math exactly right, Rich. That is exactly how that totals up and so we are indicating to you that we are going to be returning more cash to the shareholders over the next few years. As Bruce just outlined, we are going to have good solid cash flow and so we intend to be -- as we look back, we have been providing more than 50% for the last few years but we intend to continue to do that. So we continue to expect, still expect to have strong dividends. We still -- as Bruce as outlined, we are progressing toward share level, outstanding shares of 300 million. Bruce, do you want to add anything to that?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, Rich, maybe just a couple of moving pieces that may not be readily apparent there. So we have about -- we are probably in the year about 316 million shares or so outstanding. And so we also have, at the end of the year or as we sit here today about $6-ish million -- excuse me, 6 million options outstanding as well then we would expect to be exercised over the three year period. Plus as you know, we provide executive compensation, RSUs, plus matching our 401(k)s and the like that will probably add another 10 million shares or so. So if you just think of it in terms of what the absolute number of shares would have to be there, it’s probably the 16 million shares to get down to 300 plus, some of the creep we just talked about so. At least as we look at, we look at our operating cash flow over the next three years, I think your math is pretty much spot on. It does pretty much require us to do about a 100% of free cash flow over the next three years and that would be our intention.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Bruce, if I assume every segment, except IS&GS, has the same topline rate of change in ’15 versus ’14, as it did in ’14 versus ’13. I would need IS&GS to be down about 10% just to get the total company down 1% and the low-single digit comment suggest, it could be more than 1%. Is that kind of the rate number for IS&GS next year? Or is there another segment that is incrementally worse than what you previously thought for ’15? And if you could just give a little detail on why IS&GS is still dragging at that kind of decline?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So let me give -- maybe just go around try to touch on all five business areas at least at the topline, Noah, because I think you are not quite right in the way you did the math to come up with that number.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Bruce Tanner: So I think IS&GS, if we look at ’15, it’ll probably be down mid-single digits, maybe slightly more than that. And that’s probably pretty evenly split between our civil and the defense and intelligence lines of business there. And what we’re seeing there is, this is a portion of our portfolio that has always been -- I should start with that, but always has been and seemingly has gotten increasingly competitive in nature to the point where we’re even seen sort of our follow-on contracts where we’re the incumbent and we won the follow-on contract. Those are being awarded at lower levels than the prior contract were being awarded at. We are also seeing the disaggregation of some contract opportunities and the sort of multiple elements of that contract that enable additional competition. So that’s a little different environment than we had expected to be in, as we’re trying to forecast what 2015 would look like a year ago, but that’s the reality of where we are today. I think the piece that you’re probably missing a little bit is, we are going to be down somewhat in Missiles and Fire Control, probably more than you’re expecting. So Missiles and Fire Control see in total is probably going to be down about a similar amount like, maybe a little bit less than IS&GS and most of that is because we do have a pretty good size services business within the Missiles and Fire Control or technical services business. And that is also experiencing the similar sort of hypercompetitive elements that we are seeing over an IS&GS and so that’s going down. We are also down slightly or expect to be down slightly in 2015 in our air missile defense volume. This is both PAC-3 and THAAD. And that’s just simply reflecting the lower quantities of missiles that were left a couple of years ago if you will kind of in the sequestration timeframe that are playing out in 2015. I think Aeronautics is probably, and I think you got this right, Aeronautics is probably pretty comparable to where we will finish 2014, although that’s probably a little lower than we had expected it to be primarily for the reasons that I described to Carter’s question. I will point out that may not be clear. We are down. We always were expecting to be down in Aeronautics for F-16 deliveries from about 17 in 2014 to about 11 or so, so think of that is like one a month of F-16 deliveries next year. And that combined with the sustainment activity I mentioned the Carter is the reason that we are actually seeing a flat, I'll try to make this simpler before my voice quivers here, that we are making a flat year-to-year situation was what sort of lost and all that as we have a pretty significant reduction in SDD on the F-35 program, but the F-35 production program is drawing a faster than a 10% rate from 2014 to 2015. Space is down slightly. Next year you should think about as sort of low-single digits, that’s primarily because we had two launch vehicles that we recognized the sales for in 2014. We will have no such launch vehicles in 2015. We also had slightly lower government -- we actually have one launch vehicle, but we also have the Orion ETF, which is yet to take place that will take place in December of this year. So that’s a higher volume for Orion as well compared to 2015. We also have lower government satellite volume expected next year, and that’s partially offset by the volume from our Zeta acquisition, but net, net Space is still down. And then lastly, the one kind of outlier in all that discussion is MST. And we are actually expecting MST to have potentially a little bit higher sales, maybe a low single digit to higher than last year and you should think of that is primarily because of the new start activity on some of our programs, such as the spacecraft program, the combat rescue helicopter and the presidential helicopter. So hope that gives you a little more added color there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. You may begin.
Joe Nadol - JPMorgan: I would like to hone in on the F-35. It looks like your margin on the LRIP contracts in aggregate was down a little bit year-on-year for the second straight quarter. I was just wondering if you could highlight kind of what your expectations are there. Is there any risk reduction activity possible in Q4 and going into next year? And maybe just more qualitatively comment on what’s happening? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Joe, I will take a shot at that. So I think the primary reason that F-35 looks that way is we actually had some risk retirements in the year before that were not replicated in 2014. And we are obviously booking those now at the higher rate that resulted from those step-ups in 2013, but we have no similar level of step-ups in 2014. Actually as we look at 2015, I think the F-35 production volume in part because we do expect to make some step-ups next year that we didn’t have in 2014. We would expect to see the production volume or production return on sales actually increase next year as opposed to decrease. So we are slowly getting there and it’s a bit of a slog to kind of go, take a program as large as F-35 from a development to a low rate initial production to a full rate production program, but we’re getting there. And those step-ups depend on risk retirement events and the phasing of those things changes practically with every single lot. I am happy that we just finished all the F-35 LRIP-5 deliveries and we are going to start delivering LRIP-6 aircraft this quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. You may begin.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: On Missiles and Fire Control, when you look at the next year and backlogs were down in this quarter. You talked about the service part of this, but if you look at the sort of the broader business, both not service, but both the US and international since that’s a big part of it. Can you talk about how the backlogs look for those pieces? And if you’re seeing the order flow come in and the timeframes that you would have expected to, are we going to see those parts of the business up some in 2015?
Bruce Tanner: Just to be clear Doug, are you talking Missiles and Fire Control by itself and sort of the international content there?
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Yes. Missiles and Fire Control, if you considered the services portion of it, the US equipment portion of it, and then the international part, how are those moving in terms of orders and when we should see the revenues from those orders?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So Doug, as I said previously, the technical services piece is definitely going down and accordingly the backlog associated with business going down, that’s almost all US dominated services, if you will. The international business is expecting to increase both backlog and sales going forward. We have already got. In fact, hopefully you saw there is -- today’s announcement we had the turret contract for the UK Scout vehicle. This is a subcontract arrangement to actually our facility in the UK was awarded today, that’s worth about a $1 billion, that will be recognized as an order in the fourth quarter. We also had the PAC-3 order for the Government of Qatar that occurred in the quarter. It’s already happened. And that’s about a $0.5 billion. And as we look forward, there is slight a few international Air missile, defense activities. Those -- as you can well appreciate, those tend to be lumpy and little bit hard to predict, but we would expect backlog in Missiles and Fire Control to grow in ’15 compared to ’14 and we would continue to expect the international content both in terms of sales as well as backlog to grow from ’14 to ’15 as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. You may begin.
Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research:  Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Bruce, I think if you could dive in a little bit about talking about the components of some of the margin erosion you’re expecting to see next year at the segment level. Is this may be parse it out for us between how much of it is a sort of pricing issue with regard to sort of mix shift? Maybe the customers are renegotiating some fixed price contracts that are rolling off? Are you just going to take some more development work? Or is it more just sort of a volume driven through the efficiency issue?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. I don’t think it’s a simple deal to one of those, Hunter. So let me -- I probably should have done this but no one asked this question. But let me try to address that here with you. So we’re guiding towards at least, the trend information that we provided, we said, we prior come between 11.5% and 12% next year. The biggest reason for that, the biggest single reason for that is we’re expecting cost of about a $100 million of lower equity earnings from our United Launch Alliance joint venture. And you should think of that as being probably about three or so fewer launch vehicles in 2015 compared to what was launched or what’s expected to be launched in 2014. And it’s also the mix of those vehicles, not every launch vehicle that gets launched by United Launch Alliance shares the same level of profitability. It depends on which vehicle and when that vehicle is actually contracted for. So again, because of quantities of mix changes, think of that has been about $90 million lower. We’re also seeing lower margin expectations back on the IS&GS from the competitive pressures that we talked about early on the sales discussion. So I would expect to see IS&GS margins down, probably 20, 30 basis point, somewhere in that range. About half a bit sort of due to competitive pressures that we see that are affecting the sales as well as the bottom line there. And probably the other half is -- this is probably a little bit of good new story. The other half of margin pressure comes because we’ve won quite a few large international multiyear contract. So think of this as programs like for the Australian Department of Defense we’re providing the IT services for them. Think of it as a number of command-and-control programs for international customers. And whereas, the vast majority of IS&GS business tends to be very short cycled in nature, these are a little bit more longer term contracts. And as you might expect, we’ll start booking those contracts at lower profit rates in part because our new customers and they are longer duration contracts as well. I’ll also mention that we had about $50 million of higher expenses next year 2015 because of intangible amortization and transaction expenses associated with the deals that we’re closing this year. And we also have within that $50 million, about $20 million or so of research and development expenses that are hitting the bottom line for Sun Catalytix R&D efforts. This is -- you may have read about this. This is sort of our energy storage pre-revenue kind of business that we acquired. It does require some continuing R&D expenditures and this is non-far, non DOD business for the R&D hits the bottom line. So collectively again, between transaction expenses in Sun Catalytix about $50 million higher next year than last year. Despite that, I actually went back and looked at what we provided last year at this time. In last year for 2014, at this time we were guiding towards about 11.5%. I’ll say the same thing this year that I said last year, which as I look forward, I think we have similar levels of opportunity to do better as we did in 2014 as we said here looking at 2015. But we have to make those happen and that’s the reason we have made those happen yet and we’ll see how that progresses throughout the rest of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Godyn of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley: Taking my question, Marillyn and Bruce. There is no doubt that Lockheed has a differentiated core competence in aerospace. And particularly if you assume that you win the Long-Range Strike Bomber like we do. But when you look out a few years, at certain point you have effectively tapped out of the organic growth opportunities that the air force so to speak has to offer. And I wonder if you could talk a bit about how you see the shape of the company evolving in the longer term? Where do we find the growth from there? Do we start looking more closely at M&A, or do we evolve more into sort of a pure cash return vehicle? What’s next?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, I think, as you talk about the outlook for aircraft and aerospace in general, it’s still very positive for us. We’re going to continue to see F-35 growth well into the future. I mean, we often talk about how it’s very similar to the F-16 program. Today, we have a program of a record of over 3,000 aircraft and the F-16, we sold something like 4,600 of them and we still have continued demand for the F-16 and that’s how we expect the F-35 to go. So, well, there is a program of record with the U.S. government on the number of aircraft that they’re going to buy. We have a lot of interested countries internationally that have yet to come online in that procurement process. A lot of partners as you know, eight partners around the world, now three SMSS customers with Israel, Japan and now South Korea and we expect additional customers. Plus some of those customers are early on and what their needs are and I expect that they will look at additional trenches of aircraft over time much that as they do with the F-16 program. So we’ll continue to be a strong aerospace company going forward into the future. They would be a major element of our business. Likewise, the missile defense arena is going to be a continued demand, that’s a very important element of our business and there is strong demand internationally. Even as we look at our needs domestically, we expect there to be additional opportunities to use domestically but if you look at FAD, PAC-3, Aegis, Aegis Ashore, even MEADS we expect going forward. Another area that we are moving into and have invested significantly and have a tremendous product for is the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, that’s a big opportunity as we look forward. Littoral combat ship and the work that we’re doing in that arena, there is interested international customers for that. In fact, we just launched the latest LCS at Marinette Marine this past week and we had international customers that attended that ceremony, so they’re interested in our products. We think there will be a demand for that as we go forward to C-130J. That aircraft continues to be in demand. We’ve got a solid backlog of aircraft and we expect that they’ll continue to be others. And now as we’ve rolled out our commercial version, we expect those commercial customers that today are flying L-100s, to fly the LM-100J in the future. So that will -- we'll continue to look at variance of the C-130J, just as we have for many, many years going forward. So, I kind of walk through on some of the top products in our portfolio. But as Bruce mentioned earlier, big opportunities in mission systems and components on various other platforms such as the combat rescue helicopter or the Presidential Helicopter, the MH-60 Romeo that we are selling around the world, that we do the mission systems for, out of our mission systems. Simulation and training continues to be a strong demand for that and overtime they will continue to be. And as you mentioned, our tuning with Boeing on the Long Range Strike-Bomber, we expect -- we are very well positioned to win that opportunity.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question from Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets:  Thanks so much. Marillyn, a question for you. There have been some comments out of DC that maybe the U.S defense industry is not investing enough its own money in R&D and perhaps returning too much money to shareholders. I’m wondering if this is a comment that you have heard from your customer and how they might respond to your latest announcement today on the buyback.
Marillyn Hewson: Well. Yes, we have heard that from our customers that, a concern by our customer that we lose our technological superiority in this period of time when there are budget pesters and it’s a down market. I would tell you from the Lockheed Martin standpoint, we have increased our R&D from last year to this year by 13%. We are going to increase another 5% this year or so and we will continue to. So we are at the highest percent of sales that we’ve ever been in terms of our research and development and we will be hiring in 2015. We will continue to invest. But I do think an open communication with our customer, especially in the Department of Defense is really important. And we are in constant dialog with them on what areas that we want to invest and how that aligns with what that they see as their priorities in the future. A lot of our products as you know require a lot of development on the front end such as F-35, or of course we look forward to JLTV that we talked about and a variety of them. So as we come out with products, we are constantly investing but we are investing in new technologies. We are looking at how do we help our customer get an advantage of our adversaries, we have things going on that we can’t talk about on this call. But certainly there is a lot of investment in new materials and new capabilities that we think our customers will need. So, yes, we are hearing it. And I think from the Department of Defense standpoint because they recognized that, I think they will in turn be looking at making sure that they invest in new technology and we expect to participate in that opportunity. We do cooperative research and development with universities and with other government labs as well. So when you look at our percent of IRAD, you have to add to that the things that we are doing there and collaborative CRAD type of things. We are -- we are major provider to DARPA. So the work that we do with DARPA is another example. So when you total it all up, you can’t just look at one number on the balance sheet. You have to take into account the type of work we do, the complexity of the products that we produce and how much research and development that takes on the front end in the development days as well as our independent research development and our work with DARPA and our CRAD.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping Bruce maybe you could touch on the profit adjustments, not related to volume and kind of what’s baked into ‘15. It looks like maybe for this year, you will be running some where 32% to 33%. And then also if you can just clarify on the sustainability of unallocated expense being at this level? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. So, I think you are about right, Myles, I don’t quite have the number on my head. But we were a little bit lower in the fourth quarter in terms of our profit adjustments. I would expect that we probably rebound a little bit at least as we look at the planning for the fourth quarter. I mean obviously those can move out if we don’t sort of accomplish all the events that we hold to that result in those risk retirements. But as we look here today, we would expect to bounce back up a little bit and that was in the year at about the level you said I mean somewhere probably in the 33%, 34% of total profitability. I would think next year is probably fairly comfortable. We kind of tossed out the 30% to 35% as sort of where we expect that we were a little bit higher than last year. But that’s about what we expect to be going forward. And then as far as the other unallocated, I would not expect it to be quite at the level we are forecasting for this year in part because, I mean, there is a lot of moving pieces in that as you can well appreciate. Though we had some -- we had some question corporate costs that got resolved in our favor during the quarter. There was fairly the largest piece of those moving pieces and I would not expect that to replicate in future quarter so this is a bit of an outlier.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Ross Cowley - Credit Suisse: Good morning everybody. This is actually Ross on for Rob. I was just hoping to get a quick update on the expected timing for the signing of our patent F-35 and any other details you could provide regarding that contract?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, I’ll update, we are progressing well in the negotiations. So I think that we expect to see a closure on that in the near term. It’s for 43 aircraft is what, it’s the number of aircraft in that lot. So we’ll see larger number of aircraft in our update. We have -- its progressing very well and we had good discussion with the customer and we expect to conclude the negotiations in the near term.
Operator: Thank you our next question is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. You may begin.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company:  Yes. Thanks so much. So, Bruce if you could comment on aeronautical with respect to, I think you took a contract reserve in the third quarter and also may be update us on the C-130 deliveries this year and next year given there was a slip on the F-16 and the implications of that F-16 slip on profitability next year? Thanks so much.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. So actually we had two. We said there are contract reserves that I probably better stated as sort of legal reserves. One was to resolve a legal matter and other was a sort of to create a provision for a legal matter. Two different -- two different items about the same quantity of each of them. So it totaled up $30 million in the quarter. I think we released that in the earnings release. C-130 deliveries, we do expect to end the year about 24. We are going to run about 24 aircrafts build rates. And you could possibly have one slip here and there between years. But I don’t expect that to happen in 2014. We are tracking well to that schedule. And I would 2015 would be a similar level at the 24 aircraft. And then I think your last question was on F-16 and most for the profitability of that because we are losing volume of aircraft quantities obviously the profit dollars associated with those aircraft quantities will go down. I wouldn’t expect to see a huge drop-off from margin perspective year-over-year because of that, I mean, the aircraft quantities that are being delivered, I still think we’ll have comparable margins and the sustainment activity including the modern work that we do is also fairly comparable to the aircraft business that we have there. So it may not be as self evident as when the quantity drops, the profitability also drops or the profit and the margins also drops. I don’t think that’s the case there.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. You may begin.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research:  Hi, good morning.
Bruce Tanner:  Good morning.
George Shapiro - Shapiro: Little one’s, I’ll patch together, C-5 deliveries next year and do we get any chance of getting above the zero margin. And then on the F-35, if you could breakout revenues by the different LRIPs and if there is any international revenue starting to pick up next year?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes. George, I’ll take that one. So C-5, we’re expecting to increase the rate, you should -- I think we will do probably six, maybe seven C-5s this year. We’re actually performing well in that program. I think we grow that number to about nine, expected deliveries next year, so we’ll see some volume increases associated with them. I think there is a chance that we’ll see some profitability increases, George, on that. We’re performing much better as we performed throughout 2014 towards the end of the year than we were even at the start of the year. And assuming that trend sort of continues into 2015, I think that creates the possibility for that. I think we talked on a pervious call about there is definitely some what we call over and above work that we think we’ve entitlement to that we do believe we can get reimbursed at some point time, that is not yet played out. But we continue to believe we have that entitlement, which would allow more than what I’m talking about just through I’d say ordinary program performance improvements year-over-year. So I’m feeling better about the program going into ‘15 than I was into 2014. The international revenue on the F-35, it’s -- the quantities are going and just roughly I think we kind of pulled out the number, it’s a little bit out of off the top of my head, but we’re probably somewhere between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in international revenue this year and we’d probably expect to grow that number above $2 billion of the total F-35 revenue for next year. So it’s growing at a fairly fast clip by itself. Again the program in total, the production program is growing more than 10% year-over-year from '14 to '15, so internationally we would expect to do that as well.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin.
Gary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Securities:  Good morning, guys. It’s Gary Liebowitz for Sam. 
Bruce Tanner: Hey, Gary 
Gary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Securities:  Couple of quick ones. Bruce, for your three-year cash flow outlook, how should we think of capital expenditures over that period?
Bruce Tanner:  Yeah. So you should think of those as being fairly similar to the level we had in 2014. Gary, we are right at around $1 billion between PP&E, capital expenditures and our capitalized software. And that’s about the level we see in the future. It could be a little less than that, maybe a little more than that, but for planning purposes, think right at about $1 billion a year.
Gary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Securities: Great. And my second question and I apologize if you addressed it already. The sales outlook in Space that you took up to $7.9 billion this year, what was behind that increase?
Bruce Tanner:  Yeah. so we’re getting -- again I think at the beginning of the year, we had probably little more conservatism for some of the later in the year delivery events that would have going to occur, including the Orion ETF launch which should be pretty spectacular by the way on December, in the early part of December this year. So that now we feel highly confident that that’s going to occur. That was one of the reasons we’re probably little more conservative with our guidance early in the year. We had also made two acquisitions in the year, Zeta Associates which is the larger of two and Astrotech, which is little smaller, but we are getting additional revenue from both of those as well.
Jerry Kircher: Shannon, this is Jerry. I think we are coming up on the end, maybe one more question.
Operator: Our next question is from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. You may begin.
Joe DeNardi - Stifel:  Hey, good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Joe.
Joe DeNardi - Stifel: Bruce, I’m wondering if you could talk about, given some of the budget uncertainty obviously we’ve had over the past couple of years is, I think there is more confidence that that’s bottoms out in '15. Does that change the way that you think from a cash deployment perspective kind of balancing the dividend, buyback and M&A, and clearly the M&A side hasn’t been a big piece of it the past couple of years? Do you see that changing at all over the next few years?
Bruce Tanner:  Yeah. I sure help, Joe, that we do see the bottom out in 2015. We kind of teed up we thought that was going to occur in 2014 and we were at least a year off there. So as we look today, I think that we do expect that to sort of bottom out for us in 2015 and we get back to accretive growth in 2016. That’s kind of what the budget would indicate. I’m watching in particular the FY’16 budget request and whether or not they sort of stick within the sequestration levels or actually potentially based it more on the actual threats than the strategic direction that the DOD needs to go into. I think that’s going to be an interesting one to watch. As far how that plays relative to our cash deployment, I don’t see that having any necessarily large impact on how we would think of cash deployment activities. I think we’ve given a little more insight into that by what we talked about today with the higher share repurchases that we plan over the next three years at least. And as I always say with the dividends, I think our track record on dividends is the best indicator of what we’ll do going forward. So I’ll probably leave it at that and turn the call back over to Marillyn at this point.
Marillyn Hewson:  Thanks, Bruce. We will just wrap up now. I want to thank you all for joining us on the call today and just conclude by reiterating that the Corporation had another solid quarter. And we continue to be well-positioned to deliver substantial value to our customers and shareholders, as we progress towards a successful closure of 2014. So thanks again for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you again on our next earnings call in January. Shannon, that concludes our call today. 
Operator:  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher:  Thank you, Shannon, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results.

Please access our Web site at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson:  Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to have the opportunity to review our second quarter results with you. As today's release detailed, we had a strong quarter operationally and financially. All reported results exceeded our expectations, and we're progressing on achievement of our full year financial objectives. These results reflect the execution being achieved across our businesses as the corporation operated at a very strong level in providing critical solutions to our customers while returning value to our stockholders. Our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, and I thank them for all that they do on a daily basis. Our strong year-to-date financial performance also enabled us to again increase full year 2014 guidance for segment and consolidated operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations. Bruce will cover the financial results in detail later. First, I want to congratulate our Mission Systems and Training team on their successful capture of three key new business awards this past quarter as well as recognize our Space Systems group for their capture of a multibillion extension on an essential National Security program. One of the highlights of the quarter was Mission Systems and Training's competitive win of the Space Fence program. This contract will enable our corporation to provide a critical capability to our nation for tracking more than 200,000 orbiting space objects and increase the ability to prevent collisions with space-based debris. MST was also notified of two significant helicopter new business events this quarter. With announcements from the U.S. Air Force on the Combat Search-and-Rescue Helicopter program award and from the Naval Air Systems Command with the award of the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement program. These awards will utilize our systems engineering expertise as we provide significant capabilities on these important helicopter recapitalization programs. Our role will be just to support Sikorsky, who is the prime contractor on both these programs. Turning to Space Systems, our team was able to expand a key franchise program with a receipt of additional production lots for spacecraft 5 and 6 on the Space-Based Infrared System, SBIRS. SBIRS spacecraft provide essential missile defense and warning capability to our nation and allies to counter the growing proliferation of offensive ballistic missiles around the world. These two awards expand our backlog at work and help position our corporation for long-term growth in core markets. In addition to the notable new business awards, we also announced two strategic acquisitions in closely aligned core business areas. To expand our portfolio satellite launch preparation services, we acquired Astrotech Space Operations. Their addition compliments our existing capabilities in satellite design, production and integration.
 : I'd like to move to F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and provide a summary status of the program. New business support of the program continues to grow with announcements in this quarter from two of our cooperative partner countries to procure the F-35 for their future fighter needs. Australia announced their decision to purchase 58 additional F-35 aircraft, bringing their total current procurement level to 72 aircraft. Additionally, Turkey finalized their commitment to procure their initial buy of F-35 fighters, reflecting their confidence in the program to provide fifth generation fighter capability to their nation. It's exciting to see expanding levels of international and domestic procurement of the aircraft as we work to deliver these revolutionary assets to our nation and allies. But we had numerous accomplishments on the development program this past quarter, we were obviously disappointed with the necessary grounding of the aircraft fleet in response to an engine fire and damage to an Air Force jet at Eglin Air Force Base on June 23rd. Subsequent engineering and safety analysis, including an inspection of the entire F-35 aircraft fleet have been completed. Flight operations were allowed to resume last week, but there were some limitations until final root cause of the engine failure and identification of any corrective actions is completed. I'd like to turn to some of the accomplishment achieved this quarter on the development program. That included achieving over 17,000 cumulative flight hours on program, demonstrating air-to-air combat capability and completing the first flight test with Version 3I software. Another significant accomplishment was the successful landing of a carrier variant aircraft at the maximum test speed and drop rate. This success further paved us the way to conducting carrier landings at sea later this year. In the software arena, we're conducting final checkout in testing of the Version 2B software, and are confident of being ready for initial operating capability of this turbo aircraft in 2015 for the U.S. Marine Corps. We're also progressing well on Version 3I software that will achieve the planned IOC for the Air Force variant aircraft in 2016. Before leaving the F-35, I'd like to briefly outline our recently announced Blueprint for Affordability agreement with the Department of Defense on the Joint Strike Fighter program. This agreement is designed to reduce the price of a new F-35 to under $80 million and then-year dollars by 2019 at a level at or below the price of the fourth generation fighters. Achievement of cost reductions will enable domestic and international customers to buy a fifth generation fighter with its far more advanced technology and capabilities as they capitalize their fighter fleets. The need to replace fourth generation fighters is becoming even more acute due to the aging of the current fleet and increased strategic thrust to the aircraft. The agreement calls for our corporation and key subcontractors, Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to make total combined investments of up to $170 million in affordability initiatives from 2014 to 2016. Recoupment of our investments with an accessible return is included in the agreement after achievement of reduced cost of F-35 aircraft in future years. Our focus on cost reductions and affordability will be aided by this agreement as we strive to produce the F-35 for our customers at the lowest possible price. Beyond the F-35, I was in the United Kingdom last week at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford and also the Farnborough International Air Show where I had the opportunity to meet with many current and potential customers. My impression from those meetings is that the demand for our portfolio of products is strong and growing. We see broad-based customer interest in areas ranging from fighter and cargo aircraft to missile defense systems, tactical missiles, C4ISR and IT solutions. Customers are very interested in our evolving technologies, focus areas, where we're working to extend and expand the value and capabilities of our core programs. One item that I'd highlight is the demonstration of our focus on providing innovative and different capabilities to an existing program. We're seeing on our LM-100J commercial airlifter program. The LM-100J is the civil version of our proven and cost-effective C-130J Super Hercules aircraft, and build upon the legacy of the airlifter for its new commercial customers. We were particularly pleased to announce that we secured a letter of intent for our new LM-100J commercial airlifter. This customer has the opportunity to purchase up to 10 aircrafts, and we believe the potential demand for this airlifter will only grow in the future. The final topic I'd like to speak briefly about is the decision we made this past quarter outlining revisions in our defined-benefit pension plan for salaried employees. We took actions to freeze certain of our qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans in a two-phased approach and transition the effected employees to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan. Taking these actions will allow us to better manage our financial obligations at a more predictable weight, while still providing valuable retirement savings to employees. Our goal is to offer competitive benefits that align with our global security and aerospace peers, while also attracting and retaining the talent that is so vital to our success. These changes will provide current and future employees with an employee retirement savings plan that is very competitive in the marketplace, while positioning our pension expenses on a more affordable and sustainable level for the corporation. I'll now ask Bruce to go through the details of second quarter financial performance and our increased 2014 guidance. And then we'll open up the line for your questions. Bruce?
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's start with Chart three, an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $11.3 billion, down slightly from last year, but actually a little ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was strong at $1.4 billion, and this performance along with the improvement in our FAS/CAS pension adjustment increased net earnings by 3%, and increased earnings per share to $2.76. We had a stronger cash quarter than expected generating $977 million in cash from operations. And we increased our full year outlook for operating profit, EPS and cash from operations. So I think we had a strong quarter and first half of the year. Turning to chart four, and then comparing our sales and segment operating profit results for the second quarter this year versus last year, sales were down slightly compared with last year, but as I just noted this was ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was about $100 million lower than the same period last year. The last year we had the benefits of contractual resolutions that were not repeated this year. Adjusting for these favorable items, our segment operating performance was comparable to last, and again was broad based across our business areas. Chart five shows that earnings per share increased by $0.12 or 5% over last year. EPS grew despite the lower segment operating profit due to the change in the FAS/CAS pension adjustment from an expense last year to income this year. On chart six, we will compare our cash from operations for the second quarter of last year. Cash generated was just under $1 billion in the quarter or 57% higher than the second quarter last year. The strong performance in the second quarter led to an increase in our outlook for the year as we will discuss on the next chart. Chart seven, provided our current outlook compared with what we've provided in the first quarter. We are maintaining our orders outlook at between $41.50 billion and $43 billion, but we are actually ahead of our planned order level through the first six months. We have the large C-130 multiyear order planned for late in the fourth quarter. And with the size of that order we believe it's prudent to leave the order outlook unchanged. Similarly for sales we are tracking nicely to our current guidance. We are increasing outlook for segment operating profit by $125 million reflecting the strong performance to the first half of the year. With the changes we announced this quarter to freeze our pension plan, we were required to re-measure our pension plan assets and benefit obligations. In addition to the freeze, the re-measurement incorporated a new longevity estimate along with a lower discount rate and the net effect of these changes was $100 million increase in our FAS/CAS pension income for the next six months. We increased our operating profit outlook by $225 million to recognize both the segment operating profit and FAS/CAS pension income increases. We also increased our earnings per share guidance by $0.35 and we will discuss this in more detail in a couple of charts. Finally, we increased cash from operations by $100 million to greater than or equal to $4.8 billion. On chart eight, we have our sales outlook for the year by business area which remains unchanged. Chart nine shows our updated guidance for segment operating profit. We increased outlook for operating profit by $105 million for space system and by $20 million for aeronautics. For Space Systems this reflects strong performance to-date along with growing confidence that two large delivery events planned for the second half of the year will both happen this year. The increase in profit for aeronautics recognizes the performance to the first half of the year being ahead of our expectations. Moving on to chart 10, we will discuss the increase on our earnings per share guidance. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit raised our outlook by $0.25 per share while the $100 million increase in FAS/CAS pension income raised the outlook by another $.20 per share. In addition, we reevaluated certain tax reserve positions resulting in an increase in tax expense in the second quarter. Netting all of these changes our new earnings per share guidance increased a total of $0.35 for the year to a new range of between $10.85 and $11.15 per share. On chart 11, we thought it will be helpful to describe how the pension changes we made will affect our expectations for FAS/CAS income and pension funding and recovery over the next few years. As with all these projections it's important to remember that they are all based on current regulations and include our June 2014 assumptions for discount rate at 4.25% which is 50 basis points lower than what we used at the end of last year. The projections also incorporate new longevity assumptions, our long-term asset return of 8% and demographics holding constant or as I'd like to say current course and speed. We expect lower FAS expense in the future and that would make our FAS/CAS income in 2015 about twice the 2014 level and increasing the 2016 level about a half a billion dollars above the 2015 level. For pension funding and recovery, we'd expect our contributions to the pension trust over the next few years to be similar to are lower than the 2014 level, and the future benefits associated with the roughly $10 billion we have funded but not yet recovered would remain in tact. Recoveries in 2015 and 2016 are expected to be sequentially higher than 2014 and essentially keeping pace with the increases in FAS/CAS income over the next two years. Finally, chart 12 provides our summary for the quarter. We are pleased with the performance with the first half of the year as it results from continued strong program execution along with taking proactive measures and the benefits of a portfolio of programs that is second to none. We expect to resume discretionary share repurchases in the third quarter and this leaves us well positioned to achieve the higher outlooks that we provided today. With that, we are ready for your questions. Shannon?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Sam Pearlstein at Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Sam.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the investments you're making in terms of the F-35 to reduce the cost. I guess I'm wondering does it impact your booking margin on the program, and how much is it shared amongst your partners, because it would seem like near-term it should have a downward effect even if you can then recover it on the backend? So I'm just trying to understand how the mechanics of that work.
Marillyn Hewson: Bruce, why don't you take that?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. Sam, I'll jump in there. So, we're calling this the Blueprint for Affordability. As Marillyn said, the overall objective is to put our money where our mouth is, quite frankly, because we think there are investments that could be made that will reduce the cost of the aircrafts over the next few years below what it could otherwise track to. So the thought is, as Marillyn said, about $170 million up to $170 million spread over a couple of years. You could think of that, Sam, as sort of proportional in terms of the investment contributions to the work share of our partners. So, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and BAE would be expected -- although it's not required because not all the investments frankly will fall along that line, but for planning purposes you should expect just kind of proportional to the work share that we each have there. The recovery of that is tied to achieving those cost reductions. And as Marillyn said, we would expect to recover that investment plus an appropriate return on that investment. So, Sam, to your question on booking rate impact, I don't expect this to have any negative impact on the booking rates for those lots affected unless we are unable to achieve the cost reductions that we are projecting in the basis for those investments. So if we do what we say we can do then you would see no impact on booking rates as a result of that.
Marillyn Hewson: I just want to add to it. This really is an exciting acquisition reform type of an initiative. We think it's groundbreaking in terms of bringing this F-35 program. We've been working closely with the Department of Defense for the past year to come up with this agreement, and it lines right up with Frank Kendall's blueprint. He has a better eye power of 2.0. And where they have asked us to come up with innovative ways to drive down cost has boosted, just volume will bring the cost down. We expect that probably 75% to 80% of the cost reduction comes through just ramping up production. So the numbers that I started around bringing the cost of the aircraft down will depend first and foremost on that volume reduction, but at the same time we will remake these investments and cost reduction initiatives. That will be the balance of it to bring it down to a fourth generation priced aircraft by 2019 in then-year dollars. So we're very excited about -- and we've already got projects underway.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Bruce, could you walk through some of the puts and takes in the pension numbers, headwinds and tailwinds, obviously the discount rate we have that from the K, but the mortality and then the upside from the freeze?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. So you're talking about sort of FAS/CAS income change for the next six months?
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Yeah. All the details, you have netted the number to a positive 100 billion.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. Let me give you the pieces, and I should point out, Rob, what I'm going to talk to you today is also going to be in the Q that you will see, the 10-Q that you will see filed tomorrow. So we started off with an expectation of FAS/CAS pension income of about $345 million for the year. You should think of the design change that we are incorporating, so that comes in sort of two stages. We have freezing of the salary benefits effective 01-01-2016, and then we have the services benefit will freeze at 01-01 of 2020. That will be essentially a full freeze of the pension plan at that point in time. The results of those amendment changes, if you will, is an improvement of about $435 million compared to what we otherwise would have had without that. We actually had a positive through the first six months of the year that we recognized when we were required to re-measure assets and benefit obligations. We did better -- our long-term assumption for the rate of return on assets is 8%. So if we just break that into two six months chinks, you would have said, the first six months should have been about 4% return, we actually did better than that. And that better return resulted in $85 million net improvement. The increased longevity impact for the year is about $265 million negative impact to the income that would otherwise have occurred this year. And then the discount rate reduction again about 50 bips as I said earlier is about $155 million. So hopefully if my math is right that locks us from the $345 million to the $445 million pension income and that's the net $100 million benefit there.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Does that work with that?
Bruce Tanner: I'll say yes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. You may begin.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen: Yes. Thank you. I think you've just answered my question. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Cai.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. You may begin.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies: Thank you very much. Marillyn, your focus on affordability is notable, I think, because of the Pentagon I guess and the navy called out two of your business units forgetting Top Chairman Awards. How important is that and what does that say about how are you going to push the rest of the business units to capture those achievements?
Marillyn Hewson: Howard, thank you for your question and thanks for the recognition for the folks that are doing the right thing that the navy and others have focused on our performance. So we are excited about that. Frankly, affordability is a daily focus for us across the entire corporation. Every one of our business areas is tracking to drive cost out of the business and look at how they can bring innovation forward into to some of their products in order to make them more affordable for the customer. So it isn't just those that happened to get the recognition from our customers which we highly value and appreciate. But it is across the business that we are doing this. I know if you look back at what we've done in terms of reducing our footprint with our square footage reductions, shutting down some of our facilities, things that we are doing across our overhead structure and our expenditures. And at the same time, how we are looking at making sure that we are performing on a daily basis, so that if you look at our operational execution this quarter and for the past several quarters, I've never seen our programs performing better by putting off quality products on time, under budget and meeting the commitments of our customers. The recognition that you highlighted was from the navy and not all other business areas work with the navy. So we would seek similar recognition from other services whereas warranted because we are across the board working on affordability. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. You may begin.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, George.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: Bruce, I wondered if there is still a little bit more in aeronautics. I mean you basically have a lot of puts and takes there like you get 40 million more F-22 sales and pick up 35 million profits. The R&D programs explained by -- you took the charge last year; F-35 sales were up 210 million, but no change in the profit. So is that an issue of where you are in the LRIP program. So kind of you just explained some of those comments.
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So maybe I'll just hit all the moving pieces in aeronautics, George. And hopefully I'll capture the intent of your question there. So collectively, I think, let's see we were up about 135 sales in aeronautics, almost $450 million about in line with what our expectations were. We said all along that we expect to have aeronautics be really the only business area that has any significant growth to speak of. That of course was led by the F-35 program. You mentioned about $210 million of that came from the production program. The total F-35 program was just under $300 million with the difference coming on SDD contract. Most of that increase on the SDD coming because we don't have the negative profit adjustment that was taken in the same quarter of last year. C-130s were up about $75 million or so, really it was just one additional aircraft this year versus last. C-5 a similar story, one additional aircraft and a partial -- was up about $45 million. That is attributable to one additional aircraft that was partially offset because of a little bit of lower support in spares this year compared to last. As you said, the F-22 is about $40 million, almost all of that F-22 sales volume resulted from the higher risk retirements on a number of programs within the F-35 program that we are about $35 million of that 40 in total. You talked about the, I think, your question was the F-35 production program up about $210 million while the profit level was flat, and what that really results from, George, is just as you speculated, we did have a number of higher risk retirements in the second quarter of last year that were not repeated this year. I think that's just a facing of when those events occurred. It's not something that's causing a long-term concern on my part. And I think we are performing actually very well and the production programs, we are at large as we sit here today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gursky of Citi. You may begin.
Jason Gursky – Citi: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask a question on missile defense and MEADS versus Patriot. Can you just describe a little bit on where we are today with MEADS from a revenue perspective? And if we don't get any additional fuel sign there when does that revenue stream trail off? And then maybe just talk a little bit about the competitive environment, the MEADS versus Patriot and how much you care either way, which direction this all goes?
Marillyn Hewson: Well, you take the revenue question and I'll talk about the competitive environment.
Bruce Tanner: Good. I get the same thoughts on there, Marillyn. So I was trying to write those down as you were talking, Jason. So revenue stream and what's the current … 
Jason Gursky – Citi: Yeah … 
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, current revenue level; you should think of it as fairly minimal right now. And that primarily because the development program that has been undergoing for the better part is, I don't know, five, six, seven years or so that is now sort of wound down to the end. The actual sales or revenue that is being generated by the program is not all that consequential. When that would falloff is sort of when the development program finishes which is -- it's not close to the end of this year, maybe a little bit into early next year. But that's sort of the profile you should think in terms of the revenue profile that we are looking at. What we are always trying to do is now convert this from this program that is sort of finished at the end of this development into a production contract. That's what we are trying to do. That's what we are trying to do in Poland. I think the next opportunity is probably going to come up in Germany. I'll let Marillyn maybe discuss the more strategic views of Meads versus Patriot.
Marillyn Hewson: Sure. Thanks, Bruce. We are continuing MEADS, frankly, I will just say right upfront we are disappointed the Polish government announced that they are down selected to two offerings and MEADS didn't make that down select. Because we really believe that offers the best capability is the most modern mobile unit that's 360 degree capability open architecture. It has got all of the things that we think was a very good offering for the Polish government. At the same time as you know iterating Germany have invested a significant amount of their funds into the program collectively reviewed as government. The next opportunity for us is to continue to work with Germany and Italy on developing their future here in missile defense system. Germany will be making the decision later in this year. We feel very good about how MEADS will stack up in that competition. As I said they have made a significant investment, they understand the capabilities. So we expect that to be strong. The program itself, as Bruce said, we are going to continue through the development phase on it and we also expect that the U.S. army will continue to review it and figure out how they can harvest some of the technology from MEADS. Also just to highlight for you, we still benefit as well from the Patriot system, because there as you saw the recent opportunity with Cutter being announced and others, we are on the Patriot system with our missile with the PAC-3. So both systems will have an opportunity for that we are front and center in the marketplace with MEADS and expect that Germany and Italy will look seriously in, there are other countries as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. You may begin.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Yes, good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Doug.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Staying on this area, missiles and fire control, all of these were lighter than normal during the quarter. I wonder if you could give us a sense of how you're looking at the outlook for that group in terms of order flow. Obviously PAC-3, those are important parts of that, so maybe you could give us a sense of where the international opportunities are and how do you see that unit moving over time?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, I will take that one on, Doug. So I think the biggest near-term international order for missile and fire control is probably the PAC-3 for Cutter. Marillyn mentioned that as well just a second ago. That's probably one that we are looking for. Hopefully, I think we had a signing ceremony in the Pentagon here in the last couple of weeks that will lead to a contract award to us hopefully some time in the third quarter. One that may not be on your scope, Doug, that's a big sized order for us, and it's one that's worth discussing is potentially about a 1 billion order for the scout fighting vehicle in the U.K., this is basically putting a new churn and new capabilities on an existing fighting vehicle, combat fighting vehicle in the U.K., and that's being operated -- are performed by our LMUK operation. So that's a fairly sizable opportunity that we are very excited about. We think that actually has some export potential even beyond the U.K. for that vehicle. Those are two, the bigger ones that we are looking at in terms of international orders. But I'll just say looking at the rest of the year expectation for missile and fire controls, we are trying to get back to about the similar level of backlog is where we ended the year at 2013. And of course we always have the fourth quarter of our calendar year being the first quarter of the new fiscal year and we tend to get a lot of our domestic orders in that quarter and I would expect that will happen again this year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer. You may begin.
Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: Okay, thank you. For Space Systems you mentioned that the EBIT upside relative to prior guidance is going to come from two deliveries now happening at the back half. Why didn't that impact the sales guidance as well?
Bruce Tanner: It's a good question, Yair. And let me just say there is probably -- I'll say, maybe like three moving pieces that are going out in the space guidance, and I'll address the sales as well here. So first and foremost, we've had better performance year-to-date. Some of that has come on the back on the United Launch Alliance. That sort of hired to-date performance is going to carryout for the rest of the year. So that's part of the increase there. Secondly, recall probably both the fourth quarter call of last and the first quarter call this year. I talked about some continuing restructuring charges particularly as we are shutting down some facilities and relocating operations from those facilities elsewhere within the space system's portfolio. So those charges have actually turned out to be a little lighter than we expected that they would be when we set the guidance for this year. Importantly to note they are still back half loaded in the year, but the total year is expected to be lower than what we initially envisioned in the -- when we gave the guidance for 2014. Then specifically to your point on the two launch vehicles, we probably had a little more contingency or conservatism in our profit guidance associated with those items only because our profit guidance range is pretty narrow frankly for Space Systems Company. I think it was at $30 million or so from the low end to the high end. These are items that are probably event sized at least collectively. Whereas the sales are probably contained within the $300 million range that we give already for the sales guidance. So while I recognize why that could seem like a disconnect I think it's because of the size of the ranges per sales versus the size of ranges for earnings.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Bruce, I wanted to get a capital deployment update from you. On M&A you guys have been kind of doing smaller things in areas of growth. Others in the space have suggested M&A could pick up. I wonder if you think that's possible. What's the probability that that annual number for LOCKHEED moves into the billions rather than hundreds of millions. Then on the share repurchase any color you could give on the anticipated pace at which that picks back up since you mentioned that's going to happen?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. I'll jump in a little bit on the M&A question. I'll see that if Marillyn has any maybe overarching thoughts than I provide. I think the short answer that your question, if I could repeat, it was sort of you have done some smaller acquisitions and what's the potential that we could end up with maybe more than $1 billion in a year instead of spend a several hundred millions of dollars in a year. I think the short answer to that is that it's opportunistic. It's what we see with -- we've always at least since I've been in this job, we look heck of a lot more opportunities for M&A than we ever execute on. That's because we don't think all that makes sense obviously. So if we find more deals that makes sense for us both strategically, financially and operationally, then we'll close that. There is not a certain number if you go that we are trying to stay below or trying to exceed and getting that number. I think historically -- if you take a look at our capital deployment and our share repurchase plan, we ended the year last year at about $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We've grown that. I think we are at about $3.4 billion or so today. I think I said on the last call that we would probably try to get to a share repurchase that will bring us about in line with where we ended last year with cash on the balance sheet, and you can probably solve for that number better than I can, frankly. But that's probably my best indication of what the remaining expectation at least on our part is for share repurchases to the rest of the year. I'll ask and see if Marillyn has any different thoughts on the M&A question.
Marillyn Hewson: Not different, Bruce. I think you covered it well. I mean we will continue to look at selective acquisitions that really makes sense for us. We were looking at things that give us new access to end markets or some unique technology or capability or things that did with our core or that are very near to our core, just as the ones that we've done in the past quarter line up very well with our core business. We recently -- in the previous quarter we bought industrial defender, which is a leading provider for cyber security solutions. So you can look at the things that we're buying and if they create value and they're strategically and operationally lineup with what we want to do, then we're going to continue to look for those opportunities. As you can tell from what Bruce has described, I mean we have a lot of capability on our balance sheet to do what we think makes sense. We're just going to go along our normal process of assessing and determining if it's a good bid for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
Rob Stallard - RBC: Hi, thanks very much. Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Rob.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Rob Stallard - RBC: First, just a couple of quick guidance questions; what do you expect the full year tax rate to be? And also, what are the factors that you see weighing on the aeronautic margin in the second half? Thank you.
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Thanks, Rob. So, I think it will be somewhere in the -- I think of it probably in the 32% range, maybe a little bit lower than that as we sit here today. So, one wildcard obviously is whether or not we have the R&D tax credit between now and the end of the year and/or I believe will ultimately get R&D tax credit at some point in the future whether it happens this year, but we had the retroactive event like happened last year. I hate to predict that. But that's not included in the tax numbers that I just gave to you, Rob. And the second question was on the aeronautic, sort of the second half of the year. So, as we sit here today we've actually had very good performance in the first six months for aeronautics as I said probably repeatedly in the opening remarks better than our expectations. As we look today at the guidance that we're providing that would suggest that we're going to have lower margins in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. Not hugely lower, but that's the result of our lower planned risk retirements as we sit here today, and I think of how we're planning for those risk retirements in the future. The first half had the benefit of some of those exceeding our expectations, and I think there is some potential upside that we could exceed our expectations of what we have planned for those second half risk retirements today. The other piece that has a negative push on margins in the second half is obviously the rising volume of the F-35 program at the lower margins on the overall aeronautics margin. That will continue to happen in the second half of the year as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, good morning. First, just a clarification where you gave us ton of moving parts in the pension, but can you give us what the FAS and the CAS components were, but the actual question is more on space, where this is the fourth year in a row where you put up or you're going to put up 13%, maybe better margins, it looks like there are even some conservatism up in the second half. Is this 13% margin business on a go-forward basis?
Bruce Tanner: Myles, it surprised me a little bit. So, space has the benefit obviously -- I'm going to answer your second question first, I guess, and I'll come back to the FAS/CAS. So, space has the benefit of getting quite a significant portion of equity earnings associated with our 50-50 joint venture in United Launch Alliance. So, the actual margins on the rest of space is business, because we're recognizing the profit, but not recognizing the sales, has a boost in the profit that's not inherent in the rest of the portfolio. We also have a joint venture in the U.K., where we're also accounting for it with equity earnings with the atomic weapons establishment, although it's a much lower piece of it. You think of the two of those as adding a pretty good boost, the margins of space. And those have increased over the past few years over what they were, say, three, four, five years ago. We also had the transition in space of having a number of programs in concurrent development. And almost every single one of those programs is now in full rate production as much as I can say full rate production for space which is usually small quantities of spacecraft. So, programs like SBIRS, Advanced EHF, even to a certain extent the GPS III were on the tail end or hopefully completed with the development of a lot of those satellites and we're now in production. And you'd expect to see higher margins during that performance. Also, I'll just say the performance on other special programs activities within space has been outstanding, both from a capabilities perspective as well as the financial performance there. So, whether or not we can continue that, Myles, I think we've got a little bit of actually negative as I talked about earlier in terms of the restructuring costs that eventually will go away. You should also think though that we have about $40 million a year I think associated with the formation of ULA that is a recurring benefit, that I think expires in 2016 or 2017, I've lost track with. So, that's associated with the game we had on the contribution to form United Launch Alliance, I guess spread over 10 years. So, will those offset the restructuring charges going away in the end of that recurring benefit at the end of the 10 years, that's the challenge for us and to see whether or not we can maintain that streak?
 :
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JP Morgan. You may begin.
Joe Nadol - JP Morgan: Good morning. Why don't you drill a little bit into the Mission Systems and Training segment? First of all, just if you could give a little color on the reserves you recorded on the programs in the quarter. And then just secondly, maybe higher level, I think this was the first quarter where you had a negative profit adjustment since you started giving all that level of detail over the last three years. And I know you had a tough compare with the settlement of presidential helicopter from last year, but higher level -- what's the momentum in terms of performance in this segment that it's been so good over the last couple of years? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. So, I'll try just the moving pieces there, Joe. Thanks for the question. So, most of the reserve -- I guess all the reserve that we took in the quarter is really associated with the training and logistic solutions part of the business. This is a part of business that really serves the variety of customers including the U.S. government international customers as well as commercial customers. And you should think of this business at least in large part, you have to have products developed and ready for the market in order to be able to be competitive in this marketplace, which means to me that you have to sometimes make best in terms of sort of the configurations, the capabilities and the quantities of these new products. We probably didn't make all the right bets here, and so we established some reserves in the case that some of the risk associated with some of the inventory that's on the balance sheet today simply doesn't find a home in the long-term. You talk about this being the first quarter of sort of the negative hit there, and you're right. What I'm pleased with is, is essentially even with that reserve that we established for the training logistic solutions business, there were offsetting step ups or risk retirements that mitigated essentially to the full extent that reserve that was established, such that the net change for the quarter-over-quarter was really just the change in the contractual resolutions that happened last year that didn't happened this year. So, that's the way I think of it. Well, the big reserve that was established, we also have big risk retirements that were planned in the quarter that helped to mitigate that. I'll say that the second half step ups that are planned at least from a risk retirement perspective in the second half of the year are probably going to be comparable to what we saw on the second half of 2013, and always say that's sort of the current planning, the current thinking as we sit here today. So, that's your question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Godyn of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley: Hey, thank you for taking my question. Bruce, just two clarifications a little bit separate; first, on international revenue as a percentage, it looks like you're going to hit your 20% target this year. I'm curious if there is another target that we should be thinking about years in the future and then separately on pensions. You presented some very good detail on FAS/CAS and prepayments. One of the areas of pushback that I sometimes hear is that you do have a lot of contributions coming that will eat into what the cash windfall might look like. I was hoping that you could perhaps offer some detail on that point. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Thank you. So, first question, John, on the international revenue and where we're going, I think when I look around, I think we did right at or just under 20% in the quarter. So, you're right. We're hitting our number. The goal is clearly to be higher. One thing frame of reference-wise is if we do what we believe we'll do from an order perspective this year and we end up at the backlog level that we're hoping for, probably 30% of that backlog could be international business.
 : Probably the best time for us to describe that is in October when we give you trend information for next year. And frankly we're kind of smacked in the middle of our planning process right now. So, I probably hesitate to pick the number directly until we've had a chance to take a look at that planning information and get back to you in the October timeframe. I think your second question was on the contributions coming, is that ahead. So, I'll try to give you some visibility into that as far as the future contributions that we have planned in '15 and '16 at least, where I said they'd either be equal to or lower than the 2014 level. That's probably about as much insight as I want to give right now. I think the important part is the net cash, at least as I like to think about that. And net cash is going to be increasing pretty substantially. I may have spoken a little bit of code when I gave you that information, but hopefully you follow the information that we were providing there. And that is expecting to continue, and the flipside that I like to always remind people is -- and I've talked about this in the earlier March. We have this $10 billion or so of advanced funding, but it's yet to be recovered just a year ago or so, that was $9 billion. Those assets are sitting in our pension trust today and they're accruing interests at the same rate as our asset return is making. And so, one different way to think about possibly is we're doing a whole lot better with those assets invested in our pension trust, and if they were doing nothing, but sitting on the balance sheet. And so, I don't think it's a bad use of that cash. And as long as we can continue to satisfy the constituents in terms of dividends repurchases to our shareholders, doing the investments we need to make with our customers, I think that's a good use of our overall cash deployment as we sit here today.
Marillyn Hewson: I'd just like to add to Bruce's comments on the international side, well, we're not going to give you a specific number today. I mean aspirationally we're going to continue to grow in our international area. We're very much focused on that expansion of our business. It is where the growth opportunities are for us. We think we're extraordinarily well positioned with our portfolio for growth. F-35 certainly is one area, because we see in the next five years almost 50% of the orders are going to come from the international arena, but in addition to that as we talked about, missile defense, there was outstanding demand for that around the world. We see a lot of opportunities and a full range of our capabilities. And we're going to continue to grow. We even realigned our organization such that we have more leadership and focus and resources from an enterprise standpoint so that we can win in that marketplace, and I think that's a good thought, Bruce, that we come back in the fall and given that a new target, but believe me, it will be about 20%.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin.
Carter Copeland - Barclays: Hi, good morning, almost good afternoon. Just -- I wondered if you could expand a little bit on this pension piece, the delta in the FAS number would most likely relate to the actuarial amortization, not service and interest cost I'd assume since those aren't changing and the benefits until 2016 and 2020, where does that bring the plan now that you've re-measured from a funded status on a PBO basis, and then when you look out longer term, is that substantially lower? Does that have a materials impact on the longer term cash reimbursements you'd expect to see as these prepayment credits are then collected and then you look beyond that?
Bruce Tanner: You got your money's worth for the question, Carter. So … 
Carter Copeland - Barclays: I'm trying my glass … 
Bruce Tanner: I think I'll answer your second question first. So, on a FAS basis, amazingly enough, our funded level ends up about the same point as end of the year last year about 78% with all the moving pieces on an Arista reserve basis, which is obviously more important one, because that actually determines our funding level. We stayed about the 90% level just as again as where we ended the year last year. I'm not sure I follow frankly the first part of your question, Carter, but I'll say that -- I'll just go back to the details that I gave. I can't remember who I provided that to, frankly, but the pieces of the $100 million and the various components of that in terms of pension change. So there were -- the real estimates that we took are affecting both service costs and actuarial losses to use the, speak of the FASB and the 10-K and the 10-Q disclosure. So, those did affect both the service cost and the actuarial losses this year. And they affected it just for the last six months of the year. So, you should think of those as increasing in future years only because there will be a full year worth of cost versus our service benefits versus half years for the same items there. And I think your last question had to do with how does this affect recovery? What I'll try to convey is that I think our recovery remain strong. And I think I gave some insight as to what that will look like, and clearly relative to this $10 billion that we keep talking about in terms of pre-funding or funding advance of the requirements, that is going to continue to drive our overall cash collections for the next decade or so, and you're starting to see that materialize now and in the not too distant future. Shannon, I think that's getting us on top of the hour here, maybe, Marillyn, some final thoughts or … 
Marillyn Hewson: Sure. Let me wrap up. I just want to conclude today's call by reiterating that we had another excellent quarter, and we, in my view, continue to be very well positioned to deliver even higher value to our customers and our stockholders in 2014. So, we want to thank you again for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to speaking to you at our next earnings call in October. Shannon, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day. And welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to welcome you to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today’s press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. We are pleased to have you with us to review our first quarter results. As today’s release details we had an exceptionally strong quarter, financially and operationally. The Corporation continued to operate at a very high level and returning value to stockholders while delivering critical solutions to our customers. Our Lockheed Martin team delivered broad-based results across the Corporation and I am extraordinarily proud of their focus and efforts. I want to highlight a few key achievements in the quarter and then Bruce will follow my remarks and cover the balance of the financial metrics in more detail. Financial results for the first quarter of 2014 were higher in almost every metric than the first quarter last year, other than a slight decline in sales. While sales decreased in the quarter, they were better than our plan and we remain on track to achieve our full year sales guidance. Noteworthy financial accomplishments were securing new order bookings significantly above last year's level and a direct reflection of our portfolio alignment with customer requirements. This strong program alignment is essential, as customers allocate resources in today’s constrained budget environment. Beyond our solid order bookings, net earnings and earnings per share each increased over 20%, while segment operating margin matched the high point in our corporate history at 13.4%. Through our continues focus on cash generation, we delivered over $2 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, strong and growing cash generation is a hallmark of our Corporation and a key differentiator in returning value to stockholders, while enabling continued investments in the future of our business. I’m very pleased that strong year-to-date financial performance enabled us to increase full year 2014 guidance for segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. In addition to the increased guidance we were also able to reaffirm our full year orders and sales guidance based on bookings to-date and existing backlog composition. This level of financial performance is a direct reflection of our world-class team as they deliver results on a daily basis to our customers and stockholders and I thank everyone for their efforts. In addition to the strong financial results, we continue to deploy our robust cash flow in the areas of share repurchases and dividend payments returning value to our stockholders. In the quarter, we repurchased over $1 billion of our shares, more than double the amount we expended in the same period last year. These repurchases combined with our industry leading per share dividend payment returned approximately $1.6 billion in cash to stockholders. Turning briefly to DoD budgets. In early March, the President released his formal fiscal year 2015 base defense budget at just below $500 billion. This budget is flat with FY 2014 and it’s consistent with the two-year Bipartisan Budget Act caps established last December. The President also proposed adding an additional $26 billion to the 2015 DoD base budget for opportunity, growth and security initiatives. If approved, these additional funds will be used primarily to increase budget for procurement and operations and maintenance activities. The initial outline of base budget allocation signals solid support for our portfolio of programs. And we look forward to finalization of Congressional budget deliberations which are expected to be completed later this year. Moving outside DoD budget, momentum continues to build in effort supporting our newly launched Lockheed Martin International organization and international expansion strategy. This past quarter, I had the opportunity to travel to multiple countries in both Europe and the Middle East to participate in wide-ranging discussions on our spectrum of products and services and the increasingly complex geopolitical environment, which requires agile and adaptive solutions for potential overseas customers. While in the Middle East, I was able to tour our future Center for Innovation and Security Solutions in the UAE. This center will expand our collaboration with UAE government, academia and local business partners in helping bring forward new technologies. Future technology applications are expected to be in area such as cyber security, integrated air and missile defense and other security-related areas. This center will be another link in our long-standing partnership with the people and government of the UAE. My time in Israel enabled me to meet with the Prime Minister, participate in the opening of the new Lockheed Martin office in Be’er Sheva, expanding our Information Systems & Global Solutions presence and lastly, celebrate the arrival of the first Super Hercules C-130J to the Israeli fleet with its unmatched airlift capabilities. We continue to see strong and expanding International interest in our air and missile defense products, air mobility, tactical aircraft, and cyber security. These areas are already showing growth in our financials as we were able to expand the international content of total corporate revenues this past quarter. We remain solidly on track towards our goal of achieving at least 20% of international sales in the next year or so. I’d like to move to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and provide some color on the favorable progress the program is achieving in securing domestic and international customer support and reaching key technical milestones. New business support of the program continues to grow, both domestically and internationally, with increased levels of annual aircraft order quantities. While the current DoD budget cap agreements for FY ‘14 and FY ‘15 resulted in some near term reductions and deferrals of planned F-35 aircraft quantities, the revised order profile still shows significant annual growth. Fiscal year ‘14 order quantities for new aircraft are projected to increase by over 20% above prior fiscal year’s levels. And fiscal year ‘15 budget projections reflect an additional expansion of over 30% in new aircraft orders. These increases in projected annual aircraft order quantities are indicative of increasing aircraft maturity and growing customer demand for this revolutionary fifth generation fighter. International support of the program is also expanding and helping mitigate domestic pressures from constrained budgets. Another key new business milestone achieved this past quarter was the formal announcement by the Republic of Korea to procure the F-35 for its F-X fighter acquisition program. Their decision involved the comprehensive evaluation process of competitive aircraft and makes Korea the third foreign military sales country and 12th country overall to select the F-35. We look forward to supporting the discussions between this valued ally and the U.S. government to formalize an agreement and add a multibillion-dollar order to our backlog of future F-35 work. Turning to the development program, while new technical accomplishments were achieved on a daily basis, this quarter included the key completion of all flight test objectives of the carrier variant aircraft using the redesigned tailhook system. Success of the newly certified arresting hook clears the way for the aircraft to conduct sea trials for the U.S. Navy in October and move the carrier variant another step closer to joining the fleet. In the area of software, we are making good progress on the Version 2B software that will enable initial operating capability of the STOVL aircraft in 2015. And we are progressing on Version 3I software that will enable the planned IOC for the Air Force variant aircraft in 2016. Finally, we look forward to showcasing the F-35, which head overseas in July to fly at the Royal International Air Tattoo and the Farnborough Air Show in the United Kingdom. This will mark the aircraft’s first appearance outside the U.S. and enable world audience to see some of the revolutionary capabilities of this next generation fighter. Overall, the F-35 program is retiring development risk and increasing production tempo while reducing program costs. Shifting the focus on my remarks to portfolio shaping, we recently completed our acquisition of industrial defender, a leading provider of Cyber Security Solutions for industrial control systems to monitor, manage and protect critical infrastructures in such areas as electric power grids, chemical facilities and oil and gas pipelines. Industrial Defender’s offerings provide cyber security for automation system and operational environments in our national extension and strengthening of our existing IT cyber security business suite of solutions for domestic and international customers. This addition will enable us to offer an even more comprehensive spectrum of technology and services designed to face modern-day threats to those operational and information security. Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to say that we are enormously proud to receive the 2014 Catalyst Award this past quarter as recognition of our initiatives to expand opportunities for women in business. We’re pleased to be the first aerospace and defense company to receive this award as recognition of the progress we’ve made in ensuring women’s voices are contributing to the diverse perspective so essential in today’s competitive landscape. Embracing diversity is a business imperative of our corporation. It drives innovation and performance and it helps create and utilize the full potential of our team’s human capital. I’ll now ask Bruce to go through the details of the first quarter financial performance and our increased 2014 guidance. And then we’ll open up the line for questions.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks Marillyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with web charts that we included with our earnings release today. So let’s start with Chart 3, an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $10.7 billion, down slightly from last year but in line with our expectations for the start of this year. Segment operating margin was very strong at 13.4% and this performance along with the improvement in our FAS/CAS Pension adjustment increased earnings per share by 23% to $2.87. We generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations, the same amount as in the first quarter of last year and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders. And we increased our outlook for operating profit, EPS and cash from operations. So we’re off to a good start in 2014 extending upon our strong performance from 2013. Turning to Chart 4 and comparing our sales and segment operating margin results for the first quarter of this year versus last year, overall sales were down 4% compared with last year. But as I just noted, this was in line with our expectations and we expect to have sequential top line growth for the remainder of 2014. Segment operating margin matched our highest level ever at 13.4% and was broad based across our business areas as we’ll outline on the next chart. Chart 5 shows the segment operating margins improve significantly over our results from a year ago. Four business areas had higher margins this quarter compared with last year with the increases for missiles and fire control and mission systems and training leading to our increased segment operating profit outlook for the year. As expected, aeronautics margin was slightly lower than last year due to a change in the program mix. On Chart 6, we’ll reconcile our earnings per share compared with the first quarter of last year. EPS in the quarter was 23% higher than a year ago driven primarily by the FAS/CAS adjustment improvement from an expense last year to income this year along with improved segment operating margin results we just discussed. Partially offsetting this increase was the lower volume this quarter and a substantial R&D tax credit in 2013 that was not repeated this year. If you’ll turn to Chart 7, we’ll discuss our cash generation and deployment in the quarter. Cash generated in the quarter was very strong at $2.1 billion. This was similar to our cash generated in the first quarter of last year. The last year had nearly $350 million more in tax refunds associated with pension contributions than we had this year. And with free cash flow of $2 billion in cash return to shareholders of just under $1.6 billion, we returned 78% of free cash flow in the quarter. Also similar to last year, we expect that cash generated in the first quarter will be the highest for the year as we have both pension contributions and tax payments planned in future quarters that did not occur in the first quarter. On Chart 8, we’ll look at our share repurchases in more detail. We repurchased 7 million shares in the quarter significantly more than what we did in the first quarter of 2013. This more than offset shares added from option exercises. The stock match on our 401(k) plans and shares issued for the vesting of restricted stock as our net share count was reduced by about 4 million shares. Since we began our repurchase program at the end of 2002, we have reduced our share count by a net of approximately 31% to our current level of just over 315 million shares. Moving onto Chart 9. We’ll discuss our updated view of the guidance for the year. We are reaffirming our guidance for both orders and sales as our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. As I mentioned earlier, sales are expected to grow sequentially throughout the year. Our orders are heavily weighted towards the second half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter similar to what we experienced last year. We increased our segment operating profit guidance by $75 million driven by the strong performance of missiles and fire control and mission systems and training in the first quarter. We increased our outlook for earnings per share by $0.25 and we’ll describe that in more detail on the next chart. And we increased our cash from operations outlook by $100 million to greater than or equal to $4.7 billion recognizing our strong start to the year. Chart 10 provides the reconciliation of our prior outlook for EPS compared with our new outlook. Our $75 million increase in segment operating profit results in $0.15 increase in earnings per share while our significant repurchase activity results in a lower average share count for the year that improves earnings per share by another $0.10. As a result, our EPS guidance is now $10.50 to $10.80 per share. Moving to Chart 11. Our first quarter sales performance and nearly $80 billion in backlog enabled us to reaffirm our sales outlook for each of the business areas and in total. On Chart 12, we show our new segment operating profit outlook by business area and in total. We increased our outlook for mission systems and training by $45 million and missiles and fire control by $30 million resulting in the overall increase of $75 million for the corporation. And finally Chart 13 summarizes or provides a summary for the quarter. The first quarter represents another strong performance by the company with broad-based results operationally and financially. We had very good program execution and continue to take proactive measures that benefits our customers, our employees and our stockholders. With that, we’re ready for questions. Stephanie?
Operator: (Operator Instruction) Our first question comes from Robert Stallard with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Robert Stallard - Bank of America: Thanks so much. Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Robert Stallard - Bank of America: Bruce, I hate to kickoff with pension but I will. I was wondering if you could give us an update on what you expect to see from the CAS side over the next say two to three years and also what’s your expectations for pension contributions? Thanks very much.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. So, Rob, there is a couple of moving pieces going on with the pension discussion; I’ll try to capture in my response to your question there. So CAS is going to increase fairly significantly over the next couple of years. And I would expect that our cash contributions to our pension trust will probably be at a level close to what we’re experiencing this year and maybe drop off a little bit in the year what’s that 2016, the year after next. But importantly, within the discussion of pension in the near term is we do expect to see, we just had released a new mortality table that we’ve kind of teed up I think a few quarters back. And we would expect to incorporate that at the next re-measurement of our pension plans. And as at least as I think about the effects of that mortality table change sort of with current assumptions for the discount rate and asset returns, if those were held constant, sort of current course and speed as we usually do. We’d expect to see both FAS expense and CAS to be higher in 2015 than it would have been without the mortality change and FAS will actually increase by a greater amount than will CAS. So that alone would result in a slight reduction of FAS/CAS income than what it otherwise would have been. But you should think of this as still being significantly greater at the end of the day in 2015 than what we experienced in 2015 on the order of magnitude of maybe 2x what we are seeing in 2014. Cash on the other hand is likely to see some near-term benefit because we have been accelerating our pension contribution as required under ERISA. And so we are actually sitting pretty nicely even with the effects of the mortality table required cash contributions, those will come in sort of later years for us. But the CAS impact, the Cost Accounting Standards impact, will be updated prior to those required ERISA contributions, so we will actually get, as I said a bit of a near-term cash, net cash benefit. I’ve said a lot there, hopefully that all made sense to you there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. Good morning. 
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan: My question is on the share repurchase plan that you guys have been offsetting for two plus years, the options issuance, et cetera. In this quarter for the first time in over two years, you broke below that 319 level. I was just wondering if you could comment on I guess the strategy with share repurchase now, are you looking at reducing the share count going forward or is this just a quarterly timing issue? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: I will try that one as well, Joe. So good question. As I think about share repurchase, I will give you kind of a winding answer here. We’ve always said we are committed to offsetting share count creep by offsetting the dilutive effects, in particular by option exercises. But I’d remind you that we also, especially in the first part of the year, we also increased share count for the vesting of our restricted stock units. And all throughout the year, we make additional contributions to our 401(k) match in the form of stock as well. So those numbers tend to creep up throughout the year and what we’ve said historically as well as this year is that we intend to offset that dilutive effect as I said. We also try to be opportunistic. We will do the same this year. And at least as I think, of the next three quarters or so, Joe, we’ve offset most of the effect of both, well, clearly of the option exercise that took place in the first quarter as well as the RSU vesting. We will continue to offset those option exercises and the 401(k) matches as they occur over the next three quarters. There is some variability that might play into how much we buyback associate with any potential acquisitions if any, that we would make in the rest of the year. So sort of depending on all of the things I just described, the level of option exercises, potential acquisitions if any, we could see repos at a level that would bring cash on the balance sheet about back to the level we started the year with and we started the year with about $2.6 billion. I recognize that’s not what we have reflected in our current guidance but that’s kind of the way I’m thinking about it right now. And maybe just one final point. I think we started the year a little under 10 million options available to be exercised. We had about 2.3 million exercised in the first quarter, so if you sort of annualize that and that’s an assumption on my part that will be spread equally there over the next few quarters. We will be at about the same level of option exercise as we were last year, 9 million plus and that would leave us literally at the end of this year with less than 1 million options left to be vested. So clearly, our rate of dilution, if you will, will start to diminish pretty significantly at the end of this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good morning. Actually two questions, slide one as a clarification. MST, the implied margins for the remaining nine months, can you give us some color on why the step down, obviously outsized performance here in the first quarter, but even that looks like the step down the last nine months you can help with. And the other is the C-130 margins, I think they are pretty impressive in terms of the margin expansion in C-130. In ’13, it looks like you had more margin expansion here in the first quarter. When you transition to that next multi-year, is that something we have to think about a step down with? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: I'll give a shot at that, Myles, and see if Marillyn has any color she wants to add to it. So MST might look a little unusual for a couple of reasons. We did have a very strong first quarter of the year from an EBIT perspective and that kind of came in two flavors, one was we had some accelerated risk retirements that were actually planned for later in the year that simply because of good performance were accelerated into the first quarter, that obviously won't be a change to the year. But on the other hand, we actually had some just outright stronger performance than we had expected in the plan. And that's the amount if you will that we increased the full year outlook by for MST. The piece that might be missing a little bit in your thinking is, recall in the January call, we talked about the restructure cost and the phasing of some of the expenses. These are expenses for a number of things, accelerated depreciation, some of the facility's movement, personnel movements and so forth, personnel relocation I should say. And we talked about that being about $80 million for the year. MST was about $25 million of that and Space Systems was at about $55 million of that and we expected to hit EBIT. I think I described that as about $0.16 hit to EPS overall had it not been for that restructure charge. And nearly all of that $25 million is going to fall in the last three quarters of the year for MST. So, the same thing with Space by the way, well you didn't ask about Space. The vast majority, so I think probably of the $80 million, $75 million or so of that remaining restructure expense that we expect to incur in 2014 will hit the next three quarters, and just about equally spread about $25 million a quarter. So that's contributing to not just the MST scenario, but the lower going forward scenario for Space Systems as well. Now having said all that, as I look at the business areas and where we sit today versus where we expect to be at the end of the year, I do think we have some potential upside pressure, especially at MST and maybe a couple of the other business areas as well. But it's just a little too early in the quarter -- excuse me, a little too early in the year to recognize that goodness at this time. I'm sorry, C-130. Yeah, I forgot you'd asked about C-130. So they were stronger to your point in the first quarter, Myles than they were last year. We had some step-ups associated with a couple of either completions or near completions of some contracts that to your point also are in advance of the multi-year. As usual, whenever we kind of get to the end of a contract is when you'll see the majority of those risk retirements take place. I think the multi-year as with all sort of DoD contracts, we started -- sort of started with a new sheet of paper in terms of starting with the cost at the lower level than maybe where we had on the previous contract. So, risk retirements theoretically should be tougher from that lower number to begin with. So, I think your question is the right one and we'll just have to continue to see the sign of performance that we've had in the past. I'd like to think that we have with the international mix going forward and the international interest and not all of those FMS sale variety that we have some potential to keep the C-130 program close to where we are today. But you are absolutely right that there is some pressure going into the multi-year side of things.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
David Strauss - UBS: Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, David.
David Strauss - UBS: On F-35, it looks like most of the growth that you're anticipating over the next couple years is on the international side. And Marillyn, you did address Korea coming into the fold, but how do you feel about overall the stability on the international side? It sounds like Italy's a little wobbly, Canada is obviously reevaluating things, just how confident are you that this backlog is pretty secure? Thanks.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question, David. And I would say, we're pretty confident. I mean, we look at the next five years, close to half of our orders in the next five years will come from international customers on the F-35 program. Each one of these customers, partners, they go to their process, they periodically look at their security and their defense needs and they have to go through a decision process that, we are confident when you look at South Koreans making their formal announcement. Israel, we could potentially see additional for Israel. Australia is they moved through their procurement plan. At some time in the future, we think Singapore will revisit the F-35 and determine when they want to buy. Canada is in their procurement process and working through that. So we feel confident that the unique capabilities of the F-35 is going to make it remain the best choice for these customers and expect it to see that go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Marillyn Hewson: Hi, Rich.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research: I just wanted to ask a relatively simple question here about your outlook and your bookings guidance. So I noted that you didn't change it, I understand. But I thought maybe you could give us a bit of an update here on your booking guidance overall that you reported, when you reported 4Q. Can you tell us maybe for example, what has to happen to achieve or exceed the high end of the range and just how you're looking at it now?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So I'll fill it out, Rich. There is a lot of moving pieces. It's a simple question, but may not be the simple answer. There is a lot of moving pieces as you would expect at this point in the year from sort of on orders or booking outlook as you described it. So I think we’re actually pleased. I know the book-to-bill might have seemed a little light to some, but we’re actually pleased. We actually exceeded our estimate of what we are expecting to receive from an orders perspective in the first quarter, and a lot of that frankly was international content. So we are pleased with that as well. As I look forward in the next few quarters, I would think we should probably see a similar pattern to last year. I think if I was a betting person, I would say the next two quarters will probably receive about $10 billion plus or minus each in the next few quarters. The biggest single order in the second quarter we are expecting is closing on the Lot 8 F-35 proposal, which by itself is probably worth about $3.5 billion. There is also the FY '14 buy for the C-5 program, think of that as $600 million or so, and international PAC-3 for probably $0.5 billion -- $600 million, the FY '14 buy of the fleet ballistic missile, about $0.5 billion, and then several satellites, including our spacecraft 7 and 8 from the GPS III program and a commercial satellite that collectively is about $0.5 billion in total. So all of that collectively again as we say, I think it's about $10 billion a quarter, both in the second and third. And then somewhere until summer, we would expect to see a pretty good sized spike in the fourth quarter. If you just sort of back into the numbers from where we are today, that's probably about -- the numbers that I just gave you, that's probably about $16 billion or so in the fourth quarter. The biggest single item there is the C-130J multi-year, that's close to $5 billion, but that's really when we get all of our sort of new government fiscal year orders. So that's not an unusual pattern that we would expect to see there. We ended the first quarter, like I said a little higher than we thought maybe at just below $80 billion and we still think we've got a chance to be above $80 billion as we get towards the end of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi. Your line is open.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Jason.
Jason Gursky - Citi: Bruce, I’ve got a quick follow-up question for you and then just one quick one. On the follow-up, you talked about the impacts of the mortality tables, and there being higher FAS relative to CAS as a result of the change in the mortality table. Is there a way for you to quantify in some sort of range how much higher the FAS might be when the CAS is a result of the change of the mortality table? Then my question is, on CapEx, you came in at a run rate of only $400 million for the year, which would be down significantly year-on-year. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trajectory of CapEx to the rest of this year, the rate they will exit the year and what that production tied to the CapEx is in the '15 and '16?
Bruce Tanner: Jason, I'll try that one. So I should have said on the -- actually the first question, we probably shouldn't refer to it as the mortality table. We actually like the term longevity table. It just somehow sounds more appealing to us than we talk about mortality. So we'll start from now on calling it a longevity table. So I did try to tee up that we'd see an increase in both FAS and CAS as soon as that is included in our remeasurement. I did not mean to imply that FAS will be higher than CAS, simply that change in FAS will be higher than the change in CAS, if that makes sense. But even with that, and that was the point I was trying to get to, Jason, even with that, saying that our pension income, if you will, will be lower than it otherwise would have been without the mortality table, we would still expect to see our FAS/CAS adjustment more than double from where we are today. So where are we about $435 million or so today, that number is, and this again, as my usual caveat, current course and speed on the discount rate and asset return, but as we see the longevity table impact in 2015, that number is north of $800 million. So, and then beyond that, Jason, that number sort of continues to increase in the out years, at least for the next couple of years beyond 2015. So I look at CapEx in the first quarter, we're almost historically low. And I wish that were not the case frankly, but it just takes a while sometimes for us to sort of break the gears loose on the CapEx. Last year in the first quarter, I think we did just north of $100 million, like $103 million or something this year, believe it or not, we're actually a little higher, at a $106 million. So we do expect to see, just as we did last year to kind of close on the number that we included when we give our free cash flow for the year. We do have some pretty good size items, including some restructure capital for the facilities movements that we talked last year, or January of this year including the space systems consolidation that are yet to play out, but those are bigger than maybe some of the ones we would typically have in an annual year, and that is expected to happen in the next three quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: On the F-35, we saw a reduction of quantities for the C-model in the President's budget, and there is the potential for further reductions in quantities if we see sequestration in 2016. Now, I know that your pricing for the program is volume dependent, but can you describe the impact if there is any on program margins related to the 2015 cuts, and what could happen to margins if sequestration goes into effect and we would see further cuts given the way you've structured these contracts?
Bruce Tanner:  So I'll take a shot at that, Doug. So it's not inconsequential, but it's maybe not as large as you might otherwise think. So clearly, we will price the current fiscal year offering Lot 8 in this case with sort of the known quantities and run those known quantities through our overhead rates, which is where some of the variability would come in from the quantity changes so that we would capture that in sort of the instant contract that we're pricing. Where we may have a bit of pressure is prior contracts, so Lot 6 and 7, for instance, would have been priced with an assumed higher quantity of F-35s going forward in Lot 8 and beyond. So sort of the overhead absorption impact of losing those quantities of aircraft will play out and hit, if you will, some of the performance of Lot 6 and 7. Obviously, we will try to mitigate as much of that as possible, but unfortunately not all of our overhead is 100% variable. So, some portion of the fixed cost will get spread in any event. So -- and the other side of that is not so much on 6 and 7, but some of the prior aircraft and some of the other businesses with our contracts within Aeronautics are flexibly priced, cost plus in nature or fixed price incentive in nature. So there will be some sharing of those cost increases result of that base deterioration. I should remind you that all this has yet to play out completely because for instance the program of record, which is what we've tied to on the F-35 program. So while it would have had higher domestic quantities of aircraft than what we’re pricing the previous few lots on, that program of record for instance did not include the South Korean aircraft quantities in it. So there is at least hopefully somewhat of a mitigating aspect of that in the not too distant future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Noah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Bruce, going back to the margin conversation, I guess the company has realigned businesses is making changes with facilities, making changes with other costs that where the numbers are pretty large, but I guess we don't know what the starting point was. So I'm sort of curious if there is a way to categorize how much more can still change from a cost perspective to boost margins? And then forgetting about this year, forgetting about next year, just bigger picture, longer-term, is this low 13% segment operating margin in the realistic scenario analysis of what the long-term Lockheed Martin segment operating margin can be?
Bruce Tanner: Let me think about that for a second, Noah. You asked a lot of detail there. I have got to get my head around it, but how much sort of my summation and how much more cost takeout potential is left. I always believe and Marillyn has engrained this in my thinking and probably the corporation's thinking, but we try to get to as much of -- as I have said this in the past, there is much of a variable cost mentality as possible. And so a lot of that is sort of environmentally dependent and not all of our business areas are sort of created equal in that regard. So one of the more flexible businesses we have for instance is our short cycle IS and GS business, where we have a lot of facilities that are leased in nature and not owned, not all of them by the way but a lot of them are. So we've been able to flex pretty dramatically, if you just flip back to last few years at IS and GS and look at the unfortunate headcount reductions we've had to take, we've been able to maintain margins throughout that period with a pretty sizable reduction in our overall workforce. So that’s for instance one business area that has the ability to flex to match this environment. Some of our longer cycle businesses as you would expect like Space Systems, our Aeronautics they have higher capital cost content and therefore that’s harder to remove, but one of the things we've been trying to do is take a look at our total square footage and optimizing our square footage around the corporation. So the moves that we just announced in November were to take out another 2.5 million square feet on top of about 2 million square feet we’ve done in the past few years. So, well over 4 million in total. That’s just sort of sizing the operations to the environment in which we operate. I think we’re good at that. I think we are good at that across the corporation. So you never know what you have to do until you sort of hit with the predicament that the environment throws at you, but we work it very hard. I will also remind you that probably two-thirds of our cost is in the supply base, so we try to get that as well under control. That’s the big part of it as well. And while we are reducing space in some areas, we are actually growing concurrently in other areas. So for instance our Troy, Alabama facility or Camden, Arkansas where we are doing some of the THAAD production and some of the missile production, missile and fire control is actually growing. So we've got this constant increasing and decreasing. I think we've become very good at that over the years. So I don’t think that we've reached a limit as far as what we can or cannot do in the future. Then as far as the 13% long term, given that we've hit that twice and that’s the highest I would say, that’s a hard hurdle for us to maintain and especially in the near term as we talked about in the past with the significant growth coming on the F-35 program at lower than the overall margin rate, that’s clearly going to put pressure on our ability to achieve that. The flipside of that argument though is our international content is expected to grow over the near term. I think we'll hit close to 20% this year and we could do more than that in the next couple of years even. So that typically would have a mitigating function, but overall I'd say it's going to be hard to maintain the 13%, that’s just a level we've achieved infrequently and it'll be hard to maintain that going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
John Godyn - Morgan Stanley: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Bruce there is a lot of debate among investors on how to really think about these pension tailwinds and what they mean for the stock. I was hoping to focus in a little bit on the cash part of it. The cash tailwind from prepayments for CAS harmonization and better understand how the management team thinks about it for capital allocation of future. I guess at the extreme, some would argue that a temporary tailwind should be returned to investors in I guess above normal buybacks or something of that nature. That might be too simple but it also seems like too simple that a tailwind that’s not going to last forever has no impact on how you think about capital allocation going forward. So I am just curious if you could kind of focus then in on that and maybe help investors understand how they should treat it for the purposes of allies in the stock? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Well John, I appreciate the question. I think it's a very well thought out question. So let me try to address everything you described there. So in years past and not this year we've tended to whenever give the EPS performance we've given adjusted EPS try to take into account the fact that we thought our GAAP reported earnings were probably understated relative to the valuation of the company.  And that wasn’t necessarily good measure for our investors to be basing their valuation of the stock upon. And so now we've got the flip situation that were our reported earnings are actually getting a tailwind as you said because of the FAS/CAS adjustment. So what I have been trying to preach for a number of years is that the real valuation upon which the stock should be valued is the cash flow and sort of the cash flow per share to be specific with that. So at least as we look at even with the substantial conversion from expense to income this year, as I said, I think $430-ish million or so of income added to our segment operating profit that takes us to the current outlook again of about $10.55 to $10.80. I think our free cash flow per share this year is somewhere north of $11.30. And so when I think of cash deployment in particular and I look at the payout ratios from a dividend perspective or in the cash available for share purchases, I'm very much focused on our sort of free cash flow per share. And I think that number grows over the next couple of years, potentially pretty significantly as we start to finally recover some of this $9 billion or so that we've had pre-funded into our pension trust that we've yet to recover via our billings to the government. Now the mortality table that I've just described has some longer term implications that I've described. Obviously as people live longer that will require additional contributions over the longer term that should get reimbursed on our CAS contracts. But as I said earlier and I forgot who asked the question, in the near term, that actually is an upper to cash flow because we don't expect to have near term much of an incremental increase in our required contributions but our CAS to our government customers will reflect that mortality table change earlier. So this is -- that's the way I think of it. Very much looking at it from sort of a free cash per share basis and on that basis I think we still got some upside from both the dividend potential as well as share repurchase potential going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. 
Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning, Bruce and Marillyn.
Marillyn Hewson: Hi Ron.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning Ron.
Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just want to ask maybe a question on -- a broad question on capital allocation. So when you think about Lockheed's stock at current levels and buying it here. Do you think there's other places that the corporation can invest for growth? Right, arguably buying back the shares helps the earnings per share, but it's not really a strategy to fuel growth for the future, right. I mean, are there other things to do and really contemplating it. Can you talk about that?
Bruce Tanner: I'm going to give a shot and I think Marillyn -- may actually probably here as well. But so we're not -- this is not an idle conversation that we have. We don't automatically drop to the fact that we need to be buying back shares and that's the best use of capital. We actually do look at growth opportunities for the corporation. We did two small acquisitions in the first quarter as we described. We did those because we do believe that there is growth potential in both of those acquisitions. And so the other thing we try and do is invest internally. So as you think of some of our independent research and development, if you take a look over the last two years, we're up some $100 million or so and just the level of IRAD. So we're trying to do what's right from a -- supporting our shareholders as well as supporting internal growth. I mentioned we just invested in a terrific facility in Palo Alto in California to create a new lab for our -- one of our organization out of Space Systems that's sort of forward-looking piece of that business. So I think we're making those right decisions, but honestly as we look at the environment right now there's not enough of those to justify the ample cash that we are throwing off right now as a very mature business and in an environment that we're in from an overall budget perspective. And probably the last thing you would want us to do is to go chasing growth and overpaying for growth. So given those prospects, I think what we're doing is is what most investors would hope us -- for us to do and we're doing that in a very thoughtful and hopefully prudent manner.
Marillyn Hewson: I'd just add to that as well, Ron, that if you look at the things that we are investing, and as Bruce said we were up on our R&D expenditures last year. Over the past five years, we've invested more than $3 billion in the research and development, things like advanced materials, advanced manufacturing, we're doing things in autonomy and robotics, so the acquisitions remain in the unmanned space, quantum computing, cyber, energy. There is a lot of areas that we're continuing to invest in. And importantly, we're also continuing to invest in our current portfolio to keep it relevant. So making sure we're listening to our customers, extending the range, for example, on the PAC-3 and THAAD and JASSM and some of the key capability, LRASM are opportunities that we look at it offering different variants of the LCS to the international marketplace. We are definitely continuing to maintain that portfolio and look for opportunities, advanced concepts and things that we can do to stay ahead of what our customers' needs are. You saw probably the SR-72 that we rolled out, which was a capability we've been working on for a number of years and we've got a ways to go yet and demonstrate it. But having an intelligent surveillance reconnaissance capability with the potential for strike platform, which is very interesting. That's just one example, but one that I think makes the point if we're going to continue to do what we do as a corporation to be focused on being a technology leader because that is the value that we create for our customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.
Carter Copeland - Barclays: Hey good morning. Almost afternoon.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi Carter.
Carter Copeland - Barclays : Bruce just one clarification and then a question if I will on the longevity table as you stated. The dynamic for 2016 and '17, if you look out beyond '15, presumably it's the same sort of impact in terms of FAS being revised up more than CAS on a relative basis in those years similar to what you're seeing in '15. Is that correct?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, it is Carter, but I'll make the -- hopefully the same point that I tried to make on the 2015. Even after that adjustment, we would still expect to see increasing pension income even after the longevity table is implemented from '15 to '16 to '17.
Carter Copeland - Barclays : You're still expecting a pretty sizable step out to the contribution out there and I guess, its '16 or '17.
Bruce Tanner: So we've got a fairly large contribution required in '17 that we've also got a fairly large CAS recovery as we kind of get to the end of the CAS harmonization timeline there. So I would expect -- I'll say net-net cash from our pension to actually increase over those same years that you just described.
Carter Copeland - Barclays: Okay. And then with respect to the DoD or the domestic versus the non-DoD or international growth. And with respect to the 4% decline this quarter, how would that have looked on a domestic versus international basis? And if you could do the same for bookings, that would be helpful as well?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, so I think -- and I'm doing this with little at top of my head Carter, but at the discussion we had with the media earlier today, I made the point that if you just take a look at our DoD sales on a standalone basis, they dropped 4% from the year 2012 to the year 2013. And then we expect pure DoD sales to drop another 6% from the end of 2013 to the end of 2014. So a 10% drop year-over-year from '12 to '14. What's lost in some of that discussion though was we actually expected 2014 before sequestration to actually have an increase in sales amount. So arguably from a planned perspective, we're actually down more than the 6% that I talked about just now because that's sort of going actuals to the end of the year expected actuals and not recognizing what it otherwise could have been without sequestration. Hopefully, that made some sense to you. In the quarter itself, so in the non-DoD or the international content specifically, we're looking at something like a 13% increase year-over-year in our total international sales, and that's -- and as a guess, from a total perspective we're going from roughly 17% to right at or just a little bit below 20%. So but for the international growth, we would have seen a much larger impact because the DoD is again decreasing about 4% cliff. So the reason we're sort of down only the 1% or so that we're guiding towards is because of the mitigating effects of the international sales.
Jerry Kircher: Stephanie, this is Jerry, I think we're coming up on the hour, so maybe we'll just turn this over to Marillyn for closing comments.
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks Jerry. As we conclude today, I want to restate that the Corporation had another outstanding quarter and is well positioned to deliver even higher value to stockholders and customers as we progress through 2014. Our robust cash generation, strong backlog of domestic and international work, a solid balance sheet and the exceptional execution of our employees will continue to propel our corporation forward in 2014 and beyond. I'm confident in our future and because of the outstanding innovation, performance and integrity of our workforce. We will continue to support our customers in their essential missions. Thanks again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. Stephanie, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect any everyone have a great day.

Marillyn A. Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. All of us here hope that your year is off to a good start. Let me begin by saying that I’m extraordinarily proud of our Lockheed Martin team. We continue to maintain focus and achieve strong program of financial performance and a challenging environment. These efforts enable the corporation to generate exceptional operational and financial results in 2013 and have us well positioned for 2014. Bruce will cover the financial results in detail over later; I want to highlight a few noteworthy 2013 financial achievements from my perspective. Starting with new business. I was particularly pleased with our continued success in securing new order bookings from both domestic and international customers. These new contract awards enabled our year-end 2013 backlog to grow to a record level of almost $83 billion. Even more impressively 2013 marks a fourth consecutive year we’ve grown our backlog in a very challenging and competitive environment. I was also pleased that the international components of our backlog grew to approximately $20 billion, representing almost 25% of our total backlog. This has us well positioned to achieve our stated goal of expanding international revenues to over 20% of total corporate revenues in the next few years. This backlog expansion is aided by two strategic differentiators. First, we continue to believe our portfolio is the best positioned in the sector, with unique and direct alignment to many of the essential programs identified by both domestic and international customers. Second, our corporate wide focus on fostering and expanding customer relationships, directed at how we may best support their critical needs, continue to play a pivotal role in securing our new business awards for our innovated and cost effective products. Our strong and growing backlog consisting of multiple years of prior fiscal appropriation driven by our longer cycle production programs provides strategic differentiation and a financial foundation of future work. Another area of noteworthy achievement is our segment operating margin. Outstanding program performance resulted in segment operating margin expansion to a record level of 12.7%, an increase of 90 basis points of the 2012 level and marks the third consecutive year of margin expansion. Even more importantly, this performance was broad based with all five business areas exceeding or maintaining their 2012 margin levels. Margin expansion opportunities are expected to emerge in the future as our program portfolio expand the international program, plus a transition from the current 50-50 mix of development versus production programs to a higher proportion of production work. As key development program such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Littoral Combat Ship, THAAD Missile Defense System and satellite programs mature. I know our leadership team is up to the challenge of delivering on the commitments we’ve made to our customers with respect to these important and growing production programs. Another area where we’ve been successful and which remains our strategic focus is generating robust cash flow. Our ability to deliver consistently strong cash flows continues to be a differentiator for our corporation. In 2013, we generated over $4.5 billion in operating cash after making approximately $2.3 billion in pension contributions. Our strong and increasing cash flow enables us to invest prudently in the future of the corporation in areas such as research and development and capital expenditures, while simultaneously executing our cash deployment strategy of return to the shareholders in the areas of dividends and share repurchases. In 2013 we returned over $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reflecting a return of almost 90% of our annual free cash flow to stockholders. Looking forward, our future cash flows are expected to remain strong. Cash flows will be aided by higher pension recoveries plus increasing levels of customer advances from higher international work content. Our focus on cash generation and the potential for continued strong and increasing cash flows is expected to position the corporation to differentiate us from competitors in value creation and returns to shareholders. Looking outside the corporation I wanted to briefly turn to the status of government budgets. Since we last spoke in October, congressional budget deliberations were completed on full appropriations bills for fiscal year 2014. These efforts resulted in finalization of the detailed spending bills necessary to fund the government for the remainder of fiscal year 2014 and the president signed the bills into law last week. This law sets new spending targets for DoD and civil government agencies that restores a portion of the sequestration cuts for the next two fiscal years and bring the major of near-term fiscal stability that should improve the ability of our customers and our corporation to plan for the future due to more certainty and budget planning and program funding. Under this law sequestration is eliminated for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and replaced with reduced spending levels. The law also removed the across the board spending reduction methodology previously in place under sequestration and restore the ability for government agencies to move funds and discretely allocate resources to higher priority areas. A critical revision that we’ve been seeking since the Budget Control Act was established back in 2011. DoD based budgets for fiscal year 2014 and 2015 were established at approximately $500 billion per year, a level roughly flat with the fiscal year 2013. While we’ve not yet seen the specific budget allocations by program, we continue to believe that our portfolio of products will be well supported and the strategically focused allocation of budget resources. These recent budget actions are welcome first step in the creation of a more measured and strategic approach to dealing with the nations fiscal challenges. Until sequestration is eliminated, long-term uncertainty remains. Thus, we will continue to add our voice to those seeking long-term solutions to national budgetary pressures, while working to eliminate sequestration as law. Finally I want to provide some insight into the announcement this past quarter that we will close certain of our operations, principally those located in Newtown, Pennsylvania; Akron, Ohio; Goodyear, Arizona -- and Goodyear, Arizona as well as consolidate our facility footprint at our Sunnyvale, California campus. These decisions are part of our continued affordability initiative and follow a detailed review of our current facilities capacity and future workload projections. The important work being performed at these sites will transition to other Lockheed Martin facilities with closures of these sites to be complete by mid 2015. In 2013, we reduced overhead costs, cut capital expenses and removed 2.1 million square feet of facility space. These new actions will reduce further our facility footprint by nearly 2.5 million square feet and lower overhead costs. Although such decisions are extremely difficult because of their impact on our employees and the communities in which they live, we will continue to take proactive actions when required to address our customers' challenges and remain competitive in the marketplace. I'll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our 2013 financial performance and our 2014 financial guidance. And then we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner: Thank you, Marillyn. Good afternoon, everyone. As usual, we've included web charts with our earnings release today that I'll be referencing as I go through my remarks. Let's start with Chart 3 and an overview of last year's results. Sales for the year were $45.4 billion, a little higher than we had expected, benefiting from a stronger than planned fourth quarter. Segment operating margin was a record level of 12.7%, exceeding last year's record level by 90 basis points. Our earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.04 exceeded $9 for the first time and included the effects of two special charges in the fourth quarter, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few charts. Cash from operations was also stronger than we had out-looked, helped by collections late in 2013 that had been expected in 2014. This enabled us to generate $4.5 billion for the year while contributing an additional $750 million in the fourth quarter to our pension plans, bringing the total amount of contributions for the year to $2.25 billion. Finally, we ended the year with a strong quarter for orders increasing our backlog to $82.6 billion, the highest level in our history. So I'm pleased with a very strong year of operational performance. Chart 4 compares our sales and segment operating profit in 2013 versus 2012. Sales were 4% lower than last year, but were slightly higher than we had guided in the third quarter. Segment operating profit on the other hand was 3% higher than last year, despite the lower sales level and was higher than the top of the guidance we provided in the third quarter, driven by stronger performance at Missiles and Fire Control. Chart 5 shows our segment operating margins by each of the five business areas compared with last year's results. Segment margins were comparable to last year's levels in two of our business areas and higher than last year in three business areas. Missiles and Fire Control continued its strong performance in 2013 with each of its lines of business having higher margin in 2013 than in 2012. Mission Systems and Training also had a significant improvement over 2012 due to strong overall performance and a successful resolution of contractual matters including two associated with the Presidential Helicopter program in the year. Space Systems exceeded last year's record margin level with improved performance across the portfolio and higher equity earnings from the United Launch Alliance joint venture. Aeronautics margins were comparable to last year with improved performance from multiple lines of business, helping to offset the dilutive effects of additional F-35 volume. And IS&GS ended the year at the same margin as in 2012 and now has 12 consecutive quarters of 9% or higher margin. Chart 6 is where we'll discuss the special charges that impacted the fourth quarter. As is our practice, in the fourth quarter, we evaluated the goodwill on the balance sheet for any impairment; and this quarter, our technical services business from Missiles and Fire Control is found to have a lower fair value than its book value, resulting in $195 million non-cash charge to earnings or $0.54 per share. This impairment reflects an ongoing reduction in the level of sales that technical services has generated in the past few years as well as lowered expectations for the future. We're experiencing a heightened level of competitive bidding and awards which seem to place less relevance on past performance and discriminating attributes and more on simply lower costs. This charge reflects our belief that this behavior will continue into the future. We performed similar impairment tests for the remaining goodwill on the books and have no other reporting units that we believe are at risk of the goodwill charge at this time. Our other special charge in the quarter was for client headcount reductions that affected several business areas. In November of last year, we filed an 8-K which announced restructuring activities at Space Systems, MST and IS&GS that included $171 million in severance charges or about $0.34 per share. This amount does not include facility and other related charges of about $200 million that will occur in future periods. In our guidance charts coming up, I'll explain how the financial impact of the restructure is reflected in our 2014 guidance and how we expect to recover the vast majority of these costs in the future. Moving to Chart 7, we'll review our 2013 earnings per share. We increased earnings per share by 8% on a GAAP basis and nearly 15% excluding the impact of the goodwill charge in the fourth quarter. On pension adjusted basis and also excluding the goodwill charge, our EPS grew to $10.49 for the year. On Chart 8, we'll discuss our cash return to shareholders in the year. Our free cash flow for the year was $3.7 billion, reflecting $4.5 billion in cash from operations and about $800 million in capital expenditures. And with dividends of $1.5 billion and share repurchases of $1.8 billion, we returned 89% of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the year. Chart 9 shows our backlog performance for the past five years. We've increased backlog each year since 2009 to the current record level of $82.6 billion. While we said throughout the year that we bought backlog at the end of 2013 will be close to where we started the year, there were a number of large moving pieces that enabled us to reach this level, the most significant being a large order for NASA's Orion program that provides several years of funding rather than the recent trend of funding annual spend plans. Our orders in the quarter were slightly more than $15 billion; meaning over $30 billion of our $45 billion or so of 2013 orders came in the second half of the year. On Chart 10, we provide some of the key assumptions embedded in our 2014 guidance. First, our FAS/CAS pension adjustment provides nearly $350 million of income in 2014 compared with $150 million we discussed during the last call. The adjustment is higher as our asset return was higher than we anticipated in October, and we also contributed an additional $750 million to the pension trust in the fourth quarter. 2014 represents the first time since the financial crisis of 2008 that we expect to have both FAS/CAS income and positive cash from pension as recoveries are expected to exceed contributions. Next, we've not assumed the benefits from any extension of the R&D tax credit. This is obviously a change from 2013 when we had the benefits of two years of credits worth over $0.20 per share. Finally, we assumed a flat share count for the year with share repurchases offsetting the effects of new issuances and option exercises. Inherent within that assumption is over $1 billion in repurchases and as usual will continue to be opportunistic repurchase activity. Chart 11 provides our outlook for 2014. We're providing orders in our outlook this year for the first time. We always discuss our expectation for backlog during this fall and thought it would be helpful to give you our expectation for the order side of the backlog equation. This year we're expecting orders between $41.5 billion and $43 billion which when compared with our sales outlook would indicate that backlog should remain above the $80 billion level this year. Similar to last year, we had several large orders which depending on when they closed, could impact remaining backlog level for the year. In particular, we expect to finalize a C-130J multiyear order for 79 U.S. aircraft worth more than $5 billion in the fourth quarter of this year, but should it slip to the right, it'd be difficult to achieve that $80 billion backlog amount. Sales are expected to be slightly better than we indicated in October as a result of the higher orders received in 2013 and the recent budget agreement. Segment profit and operating profit are expected to be the same this year with the FAS/CAS adjustment and our other allocated expenses offsetting each other. Margin at the midpoint of our sales and segment profit guidance is 11.7%, slightly higher than we indicated in October, and this includes the 2014 impacts of our restructuring activities which were not included in our October trend information. Earnings per share are expected to be in the $10.25 to $10.55 range and cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $4.6 billion higher than what we generated in 2013, even with the cash received that moved into 2013 from 2014 and the restructure impacts in 2014. And we had planned contributions of $1 billion into our pension plans for the year. Chart 4 provides our sales and segment profit guidance ranges for each of the business areas. Aeronautics is expected to grow sales to up to the mid single digits over the 2013 amount as a result of their 35 production growth. At 2014 the F-35 program is expected to be as large or larger than any of our other four business areas. Mission Systems and Training, and Missiles and Fire Control are expected to be fairly comparable to their sales level in 2013 although IS&GS and Space Systems are expected to have lower sales in 2014 than 2013. For segment operating profit, Aeronautics profit is expected to be higher than 2014 with slightly lower margins than in 2013. IS&GS’s profit will follow the lower sales volume and Missile and Fire Controls profit is expect to be slightly lower in 2014 as some of the performance improvements that were achieved in the fourth quarter of last year had been expected to occur in 2014. Mission Systems and Training and Space Systems both deserve a little more discussion. MST is expected to have lower margin on essentially comparable sales for two reasons. First the significant benefit from the contract revolutions associated with the Presidential Helicopter Program in 2013 will not repeat in 2014, and the 2014 impacts of the restructuring charges announced in November will also cause the margin to be lower. For Space Systems we expect lower equity earnings this year compared with last year and will also experience the effects of the 2014 facility and other charges related to the restructuring announced in November. Without these charges in 2014 we project that margins for MSP and Space Systems would be around 11% and 12% respectively in line with what we said in October. On the next chart we’ll describe these restructuring impacts in more detail. So turning to Chart 13, in addition to the $171 million severance charge taken last year we expect around $200 million of facilities related charges to be recorded in segment operating results throughout 2014 and 2015 as we complete the consolidation activities and these impacts to profit and cash flow are included in the guidance we’re providing today. These charges reduce Space Systems and MSP’s 2014 segment operating profit by $55 million and $25 million respectively net of recoveries or about $0.16 of earnings per share and reduces operating cash flow by around $150 million mostly as a result of severance payments to be made this year. We would expect a significantly lower impact to segment operating profit and operating cash flow in 2015 as we began to see additional recovery of the restructuring charges in our contract pricing and we would expect to recover the vast majority of both the severance and facility related charges in 2016 and beyond. We’ll now turn to our summary on Chart 14. 2013 was a terrific year of operational performance by the company led to outstanding value increases for our share holders and gives us the solid foundation as we begin 2014. We like where we have positioned our portfolio of products and services and we’re hopeful that we’ll see the benefits of greater budget stability going forward. I think with that Shannon, we’re ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. You may begin.
Doug Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you, good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Doug.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Hello.
Doug Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I’m interested in your discussion of the international orders and if you could give a description of what the regional mix of your bookings has been in 2013? And then in particular there’s been a lot of strong rhetoric coming out of the Middle East and some has been critical of U.S. policies in the region. I’m interested in understanding, are you seeing a slowing in the completion of contracts there; certainly there’s been approvals for a lot of potential sales to that region, but it appears you haven't really seen the commensurate amount of orders, and I’d say across the industry. So perhaps you could comment on that.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Doug, I’ll take the first part, and I think Marillyn is probably better for the second half of the equation. So, I’m trying to think like off the top of my head I’m not sure I’ve got the numbers committed to memory frankly for what it is by region. So I’ll give kind of a broad brush answer there. I would say, I did take a look at this. I think 2013 we had the highest order of concept for international activity we had in the history of the corporation. And as Marillyn said in her opening remarks, I think our backlog right now in terms of international versus domestic is somewhere between 23% to 25% of our total backlog. So, one of the reasons we’ve tried to tee up the notion that we could grow our international sales from 17% to 20% is because we expected to see that backlog materialize in the form of those orders are they were received and we’ll start to see. We ended the year 2013 with 17% of our sales internationally, you’ll see that number grow is our expectation in 2014. Probably not quite to the 20%, but a little bit below that is our expectation. If I was to give sort of the regional split in 2014; yeah, I think it's heavily weighted towards Asia and the Middle East Doug, although I don’t have the splits there. I know we’ve got a number of orders that took place in our airlines business including some C-130 for Saudi Arabia. We had a couple of 18 aircrafts for Iraq for F-16. So, while I don’t have again the numbers committed to memory, I am pretty certain Doug it would be heavily weighted towards Asia and the Middle East.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Doug, I’ll add on to that about your question relative to U.S. policies and if that’s pulling down the completion of contracts and how it's affecting our ability in sales around the world. Over the past year, I mean I’ve literally flown around the world to a lot of different locations and spent a lot of time meeting with customers and listening to them. And frankly what they’re looking for is for our help. They face a lot of serious challenges relative to their national security and they also have a lot of citizen services that they need to conduct and, so they are talking to us about specific areas of concern and things that we can help them with. So, I don’t see an impact of U.S. policies on the dialogue that I’m having with them from the standpoint of our portfolio and what we can provide to them. And our priority for me and for the leadership team is that we get out and we listen and we meet with them and we understand what it is that they want and need. And frankly we’re very confident that we’re well positioned from growth because of the items that Bruce talked about, but just in general our portfolio, the Tactical Aircraft that we have, the Airlift Mobility Aircraft, our Integrated Air Missile Defense, IT, Cyber Security, Space Situational Awareness, I mean I could walk you around on portfolio. These are the types of things that they need in their countries.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Sam.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Hi.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Bruce, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the cash flow. I know you mentioned receivable collections in the fourth quarter. But, I’m sure trying to look at ’13 to ’14 if you have $600 million more in CAS reimbursement than the contributions, and you’re going to make less contribution in general. Why wouldn’t cash from ops be higher than the $4.6 billion? I’m trying to think about what is actually going against you, whether its taxes, receivables et cetera in ’14 versus ’13?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes. No, a very perceptive question, and so I think we had nearly $800 million use of cash if you will for pensions in 2013, and with $1.6 billion in recoveries and $1 billion of contributions we’re looking at about $600 million of positive cash in 2014. So, roughly a $1.4 billion swing, I think that’s at the heart of your question; why isn’t that showing up in terms of cash differential between 2013 and 2014? So, there’s a lot of moving pieces to that question. Recall in the fourth quarter of 2012 we made $2.5 billion pension contribution. The tax benefits of that pension contribution showed up in the first quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2013 we made $750 million pension contribution, the tax benefits of that show up in the first quarter of 2014, and some of the 600 plus I think million dollar swing from just a taxes paid perspective for just the pension contributions made in ’12 and ’13 that affected tax paid in ’13 and ’14 if you follow that. Secondly we had and if you ever heard about this, we disclosed this in our 10-Q and 10-Ks, we had some withholds associated with the business systems rules for systems like Earned Value Management and some others, and almost all of the withholds associated with those activities were recovered in the year 2013 and those won't be replicated obviously in 2014. We had the LRIP 5 and LRIP 6 contract definitizations for F-35 that occurred in 2013 and brought with it sort of some cash, up cash for the definitization associated with those two contracts that again will not occur in 2014. We had lower joint venture cash or are expecting lower joint venture cash in 2014 than just 2013 in part because of just lower volume but there was also some reimbursement items that the JV contributed to the parents [ph] in '13 that we'll replicate in '14. And finally we got roughly $150 million or so restructured cash that's associated with the severance payments that we're making in 2014 that were higher than obviously mid 2013. So, I know there was a mouthful. There was a lot of moving pieces there, but that's sort of the lion's share, if you will, of why that pension cash swing doesn't translate necessary to even higher cash in 2014.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Loomis of Stifel. You may begin.
William Loomis - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi. Thank you. Just going back to the goodwill write-down in technical services, can you tell us what acquisition in the past that was related to or the type of work? And are you starting – I know you didn't have any goodwill write-downs in other areas, but are these trends impacting any other businesses? And then just a follow-on question on the 30 million charge for lower of costs or market considerations if you can explain that a little more? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner: Sure. Bill, I'll take those as well. So the goodwill – once you start moving some of the businesses associated with the goodwill into different reporting units in the corporation, unfortunately you kind of loose the track of the original business area in terms of where that goodwill resided. And those businesses have been reorganized over the past few years, so it's very difficult to kind of pinpoint sort of the original origin of the goodwill itself. The type of businesses that this was acquired for are services businesses, as the name implies, technical services. Think of that as a lot of in-country support of the troops, so aircraft maintenance, actually some aircraft piloting vehicle maintenance, that sort of thing, mostly Army in nature. I think about three-quarters of this business or so is probably U.S. Army base and as we've seen the reductions in troop drawdown in particular in Iraq and most recently in Afghanistan that the revenue volume of this business has dropped off fairly dramatically. And again that's sort of what our expectations are going forward as well. So let's see, I think the other question was on the – well, I should back up. You asked the question about how does this translate – my words now, how does this translate to other businesses? As I said in the prepared remarks we do, do an annual impairment assessment at the end of every year. And the types of contracts that are in tech services, some of those types of contracts are in other parts the business. I think as we sit here today, as I said in my remarks, we have clearance right now and we're not at this time concerned about another or being at risk of a goodwill impairment going forward and that's with the plans and expectations that we have in the long range planning that we put together here today. So, if that turns out to be different we'll revisit that next year. And finally the $30 million as far as the cost to market, we took a look at some inventory that we had on some of our contracts and just assessed that it's being worked – not worked as much as we had anticipated in some of our training and logistics businesses, and I think that's a little bit reflected of just the way the market is playing out for us right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gursky of Citi. You may begin.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Jason.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Just a quick clarification from you, Bruce, on the cash. I was wondering – you went through all the puts and take, I was wondering if you could just briefly talk about potential opportunities that you see would lead to upside in cash? And then, Marillyn, the rest of the question for me is on the portfolio and whether you feel that you've got the right mix of portfolio companies and businesses than what your view is on portfolio shaping given the current demand environment as you see it over the next couple of years?
Bruce L. Tanner: So, Jason, I'm assuming you're asking upsize for cash in 2014 versus say over time. I think we have probably typical planning convention. The special we do with some of our international contracts, we tend to have assumptions of maybe less advances, less positive cash flows in our planning than perhaps we actually end up negotiating. I hope that's the case again this year. We obviously have some contracts – some fairly large contracts that we hope to de-finitize. I'd like to think we could get some of the billing arrangement with some of those contracts with slightly better terms than we have in our planning. And that's been our history frankly. I think we've been doing that and sort of improving our cash flow throughout the year. I think the whole organization from sort of the business side to the program management side, all has that as an objective and that's something that we strive for very hard. So while not obviously embedded in the numbers, I think that's something that we look at very earnestly at every opportunity to improve the cash terms we have going forward, and I assure you we'll do that throughout the rest of the year and we'll keep you apprised of our progress for the next three quarters.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Let me just speak to portfolio, Jason. Your question around we have the right mix and what are we looking at over the next few years, I would say if we just look at how we've built the backlog over the last 40 years, that demonstrates the strength of our portfolio in recent years. And as you look at the situation with the domestic budget, with the U.S. budget and our portfolio and the ability for our customers now to be able to focus on their priorities, I think we're well aligned. I'm very happy with our portfolio. It looks like it will be well supported in the budget and we know that we have strong demand internationally for our missile defense, for tactical aircraft, air mobility, the whole range of our primary platforms that we offer. Even we're looking at opportunities for the Littoral Combat Ship variant and as well as the range of services businesses within IT and cyber security and the communication series. So I'm very happy with the portfolio. I think we're in very good shape for the next few years and we'll continue as we always do to assess it and adjust it as we need to. But at this point, I think it looks very good.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Safran of Buckingham Research. You may begin.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research Group: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good afternoon.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research Group: I wanted to ask the capital deployment question. Look, at one point I think you were looking at possible mix shift, maybe between dividends and share buybacks. For 2014, are you still remaining committed to the dividend increases? Any thought here on consideration on M&A? Just looking for any update on how you're thinking and what is – really what I'm interested in here?
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, Rich. I'm not quite ready obviously to declare a dividend increase. We meet as a matter of course every September with the Board of Directors, so that's when we discuss potential dividend increases and that will be the pattern we do this year. So we've been – obviously it's pretty heavy on the dividend increase capacity here. I'd like to think that we have the fire power to kind of continue to do that going forward. When you look at the cash flow that we generated last year and the cash flow this year, that our expectations of recovery of pension contributions in particular in addition to the normal operating cash flow in years to come, I think that gives us the opportunity at least to do that. So we gave guidance and/or embedded in our guidance this year was a little over $1 billion, more than $1 billion of share repurchases. That's just to offset dilution of share count. And you should think of that – I may get these numbers slightly wrong but I know I'm pretty close here, so we've got roughly 9 million to 10 million of shares outstanding at the end of – I should say options outstanding at the end of 2013. We had roughly 10 million options exercised in the year 2013. We kind of assumed a lower level than that in 2014. Think about maybe half of that or little less. And combined with, I will say, normal matching in our 401(k) which we do through share count matching and our executive compensation is probably another 3 million shares or so. So it's probably about 8 million. I may have the numbers slightly wrong, but I think I’m pretty close. 8 million shares, $150 million bucks a share, it’s probably about $1.2 billion or so of share repurchases. We will offset any share count dilution that’s caused by any additional options that are exercised above that level and then as I said in my opening remarks we will try to be opportunistic throughout the year for additional share repurchases beyond that. On the M&A side, we’re constantly looking at that. We don’t -- obviously we’re not going to comment on anything until we’ve actually close on a deal, but that’s always a possibility. I think we’ve been successful with the strategy we have used in the past. I don’t see any state of body [ph] lists that would change that strategy going forward and that’s probably about as much as I can say on that right now Rich.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.
Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Hey, good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Ronald.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good afternoon.
Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Bruce, just wanted to try to better understand the estimates at completion, the EAC whatever you want to call it, balance that you guys get, right. So just kind of looking historically, last year it was almost half of your EBIT. And when I look at your peer companies, General Dynamics, Raytheon, Northrop, how sustainable is that? How do we think about the EACs over time? And just if you can give us some more color on that -- I mean, I guess what I worry about is if that gap were to start to close, what’s that mean? Why is it so high now, that kind of thing?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes. Well, thanks Ron, good question. So I think if you look at our historical -- first off let me comment, I think you’re higher at the level of profit adjustments as a percentage of the total earnings than what we really experienced. So last year I just looked at this not too longer, we were around 36% or so, I believe the total earnings of segment EBIT. Excuse me, not total earnings, but segment EBIT was in the form of the profit adjustments. That’s not sort of out of family with what we experienced on sort of a steady-state basis. I mean if I look -- as I look forward to the planned level of 2014 adjustments, it’s not far off of that number. I will tell you almost every year when we have a good year, obviously that number grows from our initial plan and I sure hope the best what happens this year as well. So I don’t know exactly how to compare us with everyone else Ron. I suspect we have different sort of philosophies as far as starting positions, on booking profit, on contracts. Everyone has got a different lifecycle in their own portfolio as far as whether they’re way down the learning curve and have any new development or concurrent development going on with production that would suggest maybe starting a little lighter booking rate. Some folks are further down selling only international activities where you’re at a pretty good idea what’s your products costs by that point of time, you can probably start up booking at a higher profit level, which would make you have lower step-ups, lower profit adjustments. I think ours is more comparable to us as opposed to anyone else and I don’t see an issue at the levels we’re talking about for that diminishing going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Arment of Sterne, Agee. You may begin.
Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Yes. Good afternoon Marillyn and Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi Peter.
Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Bruce, could you give us an update on kind of the skyline of how the F-16 and the C-130 are looking? Looking out, obviously you mentioned the C-130 in terms of domestic order potentially coming, but what else does it look like? You’ve got two very mature platforms here that seem to be trending down in volumes and affecting the mix shift here in margins?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes. Good question, Peter. So actually I think calendar year 2014 we’re actually going to see an increase in the deliveries of F-16s compared to what we delivered last year. So in 2013, we delivered 13 F-16s. I would expect that we will be north of 15, maybe 16, 17 aircraft delivery in the year. Our C-130 program, and I should say those deliveries will probably go back, I think of it probably in the one per month level for a couple of years. But I think our backlog on the F-16 program today is through 2000 -- I’m trying to do this from memory of course, 16, 17, somewhere in that range. I will get that covered before the call, before we are off from the call. The C-130 deliveries, we did 25 last year. We kind of said that the rate will be building with C-130s going forward is 24 a month. I’m real confident, particularly when you talk about the addition of multi-year aircraft at the levels we talked about. Again, 79 aircraft is what the -- just the U.S buy is on that multi-year program. And that’s going to enable us to continue with that 24 aircraft per year level for quite a while. And I just remembered that I think the F-16 deliveries right now go up to almost the end of 2017. So -- and again you should think of that there is probably one aircraft per month for the F-16 and roughly two aircraft a month for the C-130 for sort of that period through that timeframe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. You may begin.
Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes.
Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Marillyn, congratulations on a good -- a very solid first year. My question is to you. I was wondering if you could maybe give your impressions on maybe a couple of things you learned about the company that maybe you didn’t know a year-ago or your impressions after your first year? And then perhaps more importantly going into your second year what are a couple of goals that you have that are specific to 2014 for Lockheed Martin that, more specific than just meeting our financial goals and that sort of thing. What do you really want to get done this year?
Marillyn A. Hewson: Well, thanks for the compliment there Joe. I mean, that’s a team sport in this company. So great credit goes to the entire team for what I would consider exceptional performance for the year. It has been a very strong year. And I think what we did in the past year has really positioned ourselves for continued success and a lot of work that the team has done or has been very proactive in strengthening our core business and our international business. We have rolled out what we call Lockheed Martin International, which is a leadership focus and resource focus at the enterprise level to grow our international business. We already do a lot of business internationally in over 70 countries, but we want to put a concerted focus on that from an enterprise view and bring the full depth and breadth and strength of our portfolio to the international marketplace. So that is something we initiated in the middle of ’13 and that will be one of the imperatives that we will be focused on as we move forward in 2014 and beyond. Another thing that we initiated in a great way, we’ve been on this path, but we took it to another level with our proactive steps and streamlining our operations and improving our cost structure. And as Bruce went through, we announced several things in the fourth quarter. We’ve been on that path, but we took it to another level of looking at our capacity utilization relative to what we see as our workload and making sure that we remain competitive and have that competitive position as we continue to grow in the future. And then the third element that we’ve been focusing inside and outside the corporation on is our view of being a technology leader and our innovation. We talk about innovation with purpose because it’s -- the missions that we support in our company are what attracts people to Lockheed Martin to work in this company because we do some of the most important work in the world. But its work that involve very interesting and complex solutions that we bring to customers, which means a lot of innovation and invention that our company does and we are going to stay focused on delivering those innovative solutions to what are the needs of our customers today, but also as we look at what their needs are for tomorrow. So we are continuing to invest in research and development and continuing to keep a climate for our workforce where they -- it’s an innovative culture that continues to focus on that. As I said earlier, I think we’ve got the right portfolio and the business in terms of meeting our customers’ needs. We will constantly look at keeping that portfolio relevant, continuing to invest in the things that we think our customers going to need. So being that leading technology provider of doing everything from fighting cyber criminals to the fifth generation fighter that’s addressing unique in needs around the world. So my focus as we continue forward as a company is that we’re going to continue to our strategy that has been working focused on our core and international business and deliver those innovations while at the same time maintaining a focus on affordability and streamlining our operations. The last thing I would add is that we have a strong focus on making sure that we're listening to our customers and that we are actively engaged with them on an ongoing basis, so that as their needs change and as they face additional complexities whether it's budget pressures or global security challenges that we understand what their needs are and that we're there listening to help adjust those needs with the products and capabilities that we can bring forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Hi. Good afternoon and good quarter.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thank you.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: Marillyn, I want to ask about something sort of bigger picture. I think you've mentioned now the quality of the portfolio, I think you mentioned a couple of times in your prepared remarks and in your response to several of the questions so far. Just seeing the pickup on that as sort of a theme and I wondered if you might elaborate on that and specifically and how you think the performance differentials between you and your peers might actually play out over the coming years and how you think about balancing that fine line between what has been a pretty cost focused and affordability focused strategy to perhaps one that's more revenue focused and perhaps technology focused as you just mentioned? Is there a – am I catching a sort of shift in how you're thinking about running the business relative to maybe the way your competitors are thinking? Anything to elaborate there would be helpful.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Sure. Thanks for the questions. I don't think you should sense a major shift in our strategy. We have a strategy that we've been working on relative to our core business. It's just where we are going to market as we look at what's happening in the domestic business and budget; it's going to be flat for the next couple of years. So we recognize in order for us to maintain and hopefully grow our businesses to align with where our customers are, have the budgets and have the needs for our products which is in the pivot to Asia as well as in the Middle East. So a lot of things that we offer in those regions is because that's where the demand is and actually that's where U.S. government services are focusing, and that's a good integration where we can bring our products and capabilities. Relative to the portfolio, I mean I think if you just step back and look at – let's begin with the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35, that's a very significant element of our portfolio. It is one that represents 16% of our revenue in 2013 and it's going to continue to grow. We've got the eight international partners. We have security cooperation partners with digital in Japan. We have other countries that are looking at it with South Korea, with Singapore, with others that I think will – that are interested in the Middle East that have expressed their interests. So I still see that as something that is a differentiator for us because no one else has a fifth generation fighter and it's a unique capability that is needed around the world. At the same time, the F-16, as Bruce was talking about the backlog on the F-16, there is still a strong demand for the F-16 around the world and there are opportunities for upgrades. We're doing the upgrades in Taiwan, opportunities in Singapore and we'll see other opportunities here. So that piece of our business continues. Missile defense in that arena with THAAD, PAC-3, the Aegis Systems, MEADS and our opportunities for MEADS, all affordable systems that have the full domain and very strong in terms of air and missile defense. And then the whole satellite components to come with that as well. Our targeting systems with Sniper, MTAD, Arrowhead, those also continue to be in demand around the world; cyber security, C4ISR. If you just step back and look at this portfolio and the range of capabilities we have and the depth and breadth and experience that we have, I really stand behind the fact I do believe we have the best portfolio, the best positioned portfolio for the needs today. And we're not going to rest on our laurels, we're going to continue to invest in that portfolio and continue to keep it relevant and stay abreast of where our customers are moving and invest in technologies and things that take them forward. You've probably seen similar things that we're looking at in terms of longer range opportunities, directed energy or advanced capabilities and manufacturing advance materials in the energy space. So we've got a lot of things that are more in our adjacent areas and areas that both in our core are adjacent that we're going to continue to invest in. But the basic core portfolio that we have is well positioned and I think well supported by the U.S. budget and great demand internationally.
Bruce L. Tanner: Carter, the only thing I might add as I'm listening to Marillyn there is I think we've got a really interesting sort of situation where the products that we are developing are not – and that we anticipate the ability to sell in production and particularly to sell internationally are not long-tenured products. We've got capabilities. We have some of those as well, obviously with C-130 and F-16s, but no one has sort of the current air missile defense products that we have in terms of MEADS, in terms of Littoral Combat Ships from a naval perspective, in terms of an F-35. So we're kind of uniquely positioned that a lot of our products are through the developmental cycle. There will be quite a bit of time before you see new products develop just because there's going to be a delay in new starts with the fiscal pressures that we're facing. And our portfolio is available now and has sort of got the good backing of the U.S. Military behind us. Now I think that's got us very uniquely positioned.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Company: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good afternoon.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Company: I don't know if this is for Marillyn or Bruce or both, but it feels to me like one of the bigger debates in this space right now is if a company like Lockheed Martin can forecast that revenues will be flat in 2014 despite all of the churn mostly downward in the defense budget, argument one is that that's largely everything you're talking about with the portfolio being differentiated versus the industry. Argument two is that that's almost entirely the lag effect between the decline in authority in 2012 and 2013 and that there is another shoot or drop, if you will, on the top line in 2015 and 2016. And I know you're only starting to talk about '14 today officially, but I thought perhaps now that you have a '14 budget and some discussion of the '15 request, maybe a little more insight into the Pentagon strategy moving forward, if you could shed a little bit more light on which of those you'd think it is?
Bruce L. Tanner: I'll take the first shot and Marillyn can provide some color commentary on that. But it's an interesting question. I think it's one that we've talked about ourselves internally as well. And sort of the heart of your question I think is so have we bottomed out or not? And you posed two different scenarios there. One is the value of the portfolio and then sort of the lag effect of the budget authority. I do believe as Marillyn has said quite vividly that the portfolio that we have is differentiated, I think that is what's enabled us to survive without having huge drops year-over-year. I think the part that again people are missing when we talk about the effects of sequestration, where we are right now is our portfolio pre-sequestration would have been growing in these periods of times. So we are seeing reductions, but the reductions are taking us back to sort of a flat scenario as opposed to taking us to a negative gross scenario. And I get the point, believe me, that our outlook for 2014 is below '13 and '13 was below '12, but going forward from '14, '15, I think we're going to be – hopefully, we've hit the bottom. If not, I think we're very, very close to that between '14, '15. And if you just take a look at the budget agreement that was signed this past week and a half or whatever that provided the incremental benefits over a full sequestration for fiscal year '14 and '15, that essentially makes the DoD top line kind of flat. And then if you take a look at FY '16, under sequestration today that actually shows a slight increase over the FY '15 levels as we sit here today. So I'm, I'll say cautiously optimistic. We've sort of reached bottom and that we have – at least for Lockheed Martin, we have the opportunity to see some growth in the not too distant future.
Marillyn A. Hewson: I don't have much to add to that. We have looked at it closely. Of course, the DoD budget is something we watch closely and so as we saw the bill get passed and looked at the outlook, I mean, we're basically flat for the next two years within that budget does start to increase. So, when you take that coupled with our strong portfolio and the ability for the DoD to decide where they want to spend their money as opposed to it being an across the board cut, we think we are well positioned and allowing them to make those kinds of decisions through a non-sequestration environment is what, how we're going to hold up well and we will be differentiated. So, I am of the mind that we're -- as Bruce said, we have looked at it a lot, we are at the bottom or near the bottom and we should see an increase in the next few years.
Jerry F. Kircher, III: Shannon, this is Jerry. I think we’ve cover up an hour. Maybe one more question, then we’ll turn it back to Marillyn for final thoughts.
Operator: Our next question is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. You may begin.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co. Inc.: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Marillyn, you had a chance probably to go through the '14 budget in a pretty fine detail now, and if you look to your point, you clearly have a lot of important foundation programs that do make Lockheed differentiated. Could you address a little bit where some of the shortfalls are versus what's it like? And also, flat in one sense is good, but the reality is you still have some inflation, so you have to find productivity and other measures to make up for that. So really the question is, sort of where are the holes you have to fill which are probably a couple and then what about more productivity measures beyond what you've done?
Marillyn A. Hewson: Well, first of all I mean, there is strong support for our program as we've looked at it across the entire portfolio and we've looked at every one of our major programs to see how they hold up, and I would say in large measure that we are strongly supported. The F-35 showed some cuts, but it appears that those are primarily in the government fund side. If you look at our multi-year order on Orion, the opportunities we have for multi-year on C-130J and it’s just a matter of getting through that process. I think we are in a good position. In terms of your comments about inflation and continuing to stay after managing our cost, we are absolutely going to do that. This is a team that understands that, this leadership team is well experienced of that and we work it every day and we'll continue to do so. We're not going -- we've been, I think very proactive over the last several years and we've recognized that, that is an ongoing thing to constantly stay abreast of what our cost positions are and streamline our business so that we can continue to be competitive.
Bruce L. Tanner: But I assure you Howard (audio break) Marillyn is relentless when it comes to her (technical difficulty).
Marillyn A. Hewson: No, we’re not perfect as any business is not perfect. But when we look at the breadth of our business and the ability to bring our very talented workforce to bear with the technologies and opportunities that we have to keep our business relevant, there's no program that's out there, no major one that's sun setting and we look at our production rates there either maintaining or they're growing across our major programs. So, I think I stand by my position. We got a strong portfolio and we're going to weather this flat period and then continue to grow. So let me just wrap up for the call today. I appreciate all the questions from all of you today, and I just want to conclude by saying again that, I believe that our 2013 results mark another year of continued high performance in a challenging environment, and they demonstrate that we continue to be well positioned to provide solutions to our customers and value to our shareholders. If you look at our records backlog of work, our robust cash generation, our solid balance sheet and the exceptional execution of our employees, I'm confident that it's going to continue to propel our corporation forward in 2014 and beyond. And it's really due to the integrity, the performance and the innovation of our workforce that we're going to be able to support our customers in their essential mission. So, thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you in our next earnings call in April. Shannon that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry F. Kircher, III: Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to welcome you to our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I like to remind you the statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I hope you’ve all had a chance to review our third quarter earnings release and financial results. The results directly illustrate the continuation of our strong operational and financial momentum and enabled us to increase our financial outlook for 2013. The focus and efforts of our Lockheed Martin team continued to position the Corporation for delivery of solutions to customers and value to shareholders. I offer my congratulations and appreciation to all of our employees and especially to those employees directly affected by the government shutdown, for their outstanding achievements and performance while operating in a challenging and dynamic environment. While there were numerous financial accomplishments in the quarter that Bruce will outline in his comments, I want to offer my thoughts on key strategic achievements this quarter. From my perspective, beyond the program execution and financial results that remain exceptional, other accomplishments can be seen in three key strategic areas. These areas are backlog expansion, international growth and cash generation. We have continued to describe our portfolio as the best positioned in the sector with unique and direct alignment to many of the essential programs identified by customers as they satisfy their national security requirements. Many of our programs have provided these solutions to customers over several decades, because they are proven and they are cost-effective. Addressed validation of this alignment and positioning of our programs to customers’ needs is visible with our achievement of increased – increasing levels of annual backlog for the past three years ending with over $82 billion in backlog at year-end 2012, while operating in a challenging global and domestic economic environment. This quarter, our portfolio alignment and product offerings resulted in $15 billion in new orders and expansion of our backlog to nearly $79 billion. We continue to execute on the forecast we outlined to you at the beginning of the year that our backlog expansion would resume in the third quarter. Looking forward, the new business pipeline remains robust with significant domestic and international awards expected later this year on many of our legacy programs. With the establishment of a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2014 in place through January 15, we remain on the path previously outlined to you, to further expand our backlog in the fourth quarter to a year-end estimate of at least $80 billion. Our ability to continue the expansion of our backlog is strategically important as it helps solidify our business and provide visibility into our future financial outlook. Our strong backlog consisting of multiple years of prior fiscal appropriations driven by our longer cycle production programs provides a level of financial stability and strategic differentiation in this era of potential government budget uncertainty. Another area within which we achieved significant strategic progress this quarter was in the international business arena. As you recall, we have a stated goal to expand our international sales content to at least 20% of revenues in the next few years. To achieve this goal, we have moved aggressively to build upon our long-standing in-country presence and further strengthen relationships with international countries around the world through partnerships, in-country production, and establishment of in-country joint technology offices. All of these actions are essential to enable expansion of international work for the Corporation. Financial benefits to the Corporation are increased sales, cash flow, and earnings contribution. Benefits to our customers are increased factory loading and our ability to improve cost through higher production throughput. Specific events furthering our international expansion were seen across multiple business areas this quarter and included finalization of a multibillion dollar award from the United Arab Emirates for our THAAD missile defense system. This was a significant strategic event with the UAE serving as the inaugural international customer for the THAAD system. Demand for this proven system is only growing and has been expressed by numerous countries from the Asia-Pacific region to the Middle East. Additionally, finalization of our LRIP 6 and 7 contracts on the F-35 program contained a growing component of international work with inclusion of new aircraft awards for Australia, Italy, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Looking forward into 2014, Japan and Israel are scheduled to finalize new orders, which would further expand our international backlog. Additional international award can be seen on the near horizon with the Netherlands’ announcement of its first order to procure Joint Strike Fighters for its national defense. We look forward to providing these revolutionary aircraft to one of our key strategic partner countries. Finally, we were pleased that South Korea plans to reopen the competition for their future fighter program, potentially providing us a new customer opportunity for our fifth generation F-35 Fighter and further growth in international activity. Our international work is expected to grow and help mitigate domestic pressures in 2014 with growth visible and achievable due to our backlog of existing work. Our international expansion is broad based, is happening now, and we feel increasingly confident about our achievement of our stated goal of at least 20% in the near future. Let me turn to cash flow. Our ability to deliver consistently strong cash flows continues to be a strategic differentiator for our Corporation. The importance of cash is embedded in our corporate DNA. I was pleased that we were able to – again able to increase our 2013 cash flow outlook this quarter. Our strong and increasing cash flow enables us to invest prudently in the future of the Corporation, in areas such as capital expenditures, and research and development, while also providing the ability to pursue our cash deployment strategy for returns to shareholders in the areas of increasing dividends and share repurchases. We continue to strongly believe in the return of value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As I look forward, our future cash flows are expected to be aided by increasing levels of customer advances from growing international work and recovery of our $8 billion in prior year’s pension contributions. We feel very good about our future cash and the potential for continued strong and increasing cash flows that will position the Corporation to differentiate from competitors. Before turning the call over to Bruce to cover financials, I wanted to briefly speak about Government budgets. Last week, agreement was reached to implement a continuing resolution to fund FY14 government expenditures through January 15, 2014. This action enabled federal agencies to return to work and eliminated the partial Government shutdown. The agreement also extended the nation’s debt limit authority until February 7, 2014, avoiding a default that could have occurred last week. Additionally, Congress agreed to conduct conference committee discussions on FY14 budget levels and cost elements with a goal for completion of a budget agreement by December 13, 2013. These actions are a step forward as they enable resumption of full government and contractor operations during the periods outlined. Resumption of normal work is the best path forward to eliminate disruptions to operations, enable cost affordability and savings initiative to progress and provide critical equipment and services to our customers. There is still much budget work to be done by Congress to address the debt ceiling before February 7 and determine the level of funding for the entire 2014 fiscal year before the continuing resolution expires next January. We continue to urge Congress and the administration to focus on long-term solutions to confront the difficult fiscal issues facing our country and avoid a repeat of the disruption that the nation recently experienced. As part of those solutions, we also ask that they address and revise the across the board budget reduction policy required under the current sequestration law. This non-strategic allocation of budget reductions is not good for our nation or our national security strategy. With the closure of Government fiscal year 2013, we can now determine that budget reduction action implemented under sequestration will result in a limited impact to our portfolio of programs in 2013, with impacts seen primarily on our shorter cycle business. Our original estimate of $825 million in potential reduction to revenues was significantly muted due to our large backlog of work remaining unaffected by FY13 budget cuts. This enabled us to refine our revenue outlook for calendar year 2013 to a new guidance value of approximately $45 billion, better than we projected on our July earnings call. As we look forward into 2014, clearly there is no shortage of possible government budget outcomes. These outcomes range from full implementation of sequestration cuts required under the Budget Control Act to less severe scenarios. These multiple scenarios are challenging to predict. However, with our anticipated strong year-end backlog I spoke to earlier, aided by growing international revenues unaffected by U.S. government budget actions, we are expecting to see mitigation of financial impacts on our Corporation. Accordingly, we are providing initial trend analysis for 2014 that projects our revenues to be only slightly below 2013 levels. I’ll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our 2013 financial performance and 2014 trend analysis, and then we’ll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let’s start with Chart 3 and an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $11.3 billion, down from last year, but slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating margin continued to be very strong at 12.8% and this strong performance contributed to a 16% increase in earnings per share to $2.57 from continuing operations. We generated $900 million in cash from operations after a $750 million pension contribution. We continued to reward our shareholders with almost $1 billion of cash returned to the repurchase of nearly 5 million shares along with our quarterly dividend payment. As expected, we received $15 billion in orders in the quarter, which brings our backlog to just under $79 billion, and finally due to our operating performance, we increased our 2013 outlook for segment operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations. Chart 4 shows our sales and segment operating margins for the third quarter this year versus last year. Our sales were 4% lower than last year, but ahead of our expectations after sequestration was enacted. Segment operating margin increased 70 basis points over the third quarter of last year to 12.8%, continuing the strong performance we’ve achieved thus far this year. We’ll show the breadth of the margin improvement on Chart 5, which shows our third quarter segment operating margins for each of the 5 business areas compared with last year’s results. Segment margins were higher or comparable in 4 of the 5 business areas. Improvements in Missiles and Fire Control resulted from improved performance across a number of programs, most notably in Air and Missile Defense programs such as PAC-3 and THAAD and Fire Control programs such as the LANTIRN and Sniper programs. Improvements in Mission Systems and Training were also broad based with the largest improvement coming from our radar programs. Margins in Aeronautics and IS&GS were slightly higher or comparable, while our margin in Space Systems remained strong and was 60 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year. Last year’s results were the highest level ever experienced in Space Systems and included significantly higher earnings from our United Launch Alliance and United Space Alliance joint ventures, the latter due to wind down activities in 2012. Turning to Chart 6, we’ll discuss our earnings per share. EPS from continuing operations in the quarter was 16% higher than a year ago at $2.57 per share, driven primarily by improved margins and a lower FAS/CAS adjustment this year. On a pension-adjusted basis, our EPS grew to $2.80 per share in the quarter. On Chart 7, we’ll discuss our cash from operations in the quarter. We continue to have excellent cash generation with $900 million in the quarter, although that is lower than last year’s level, we made a $750 million pension contribution this year, while no contribution was made in the third quarter of last year. We’ve completed our planned funding of our pension plans in 2013 and consistent with our historical practices, we will evaluate making additional contributions to our pension trusts at year-end, but only to the extent that these contributions will not impact our ability to generate $4.3 billion in cash from operations. Turning to Chart 8, we’ll discuss our cash return to shareholders in the quarter. We’ve returned almost $1billion to shareholders this quarter through share repurchases and dividends. The level of share repurchases was more than double what we did in the third quarter of last year and brings the total cash returned so far this year to more than $2.6 billion. Moving to Chart 9, we’ll look at our backlog and book-to-bill ratios since last year. Consistent with the quarterly backlog profile, we provided at the beginning of the year, our backlog grew to just under $79 billion this quarter, achieving a strong book-to-bill ratio of $1.3 billion. We continue to expect that backlog will increase further in the fourth quarter and end the year above the $80 billion level. On Chart 10, we provide our updated guidance. As we said on the last call, the effects of sequestration were not as great this year as we had initially modeled them to be and we now feel comfortable in saying our sales for the year are anticipated to be around the $45 billion level. Reflecting our strong operational performance throughout this year, we’re increasing our forecasted segment operating profit by $125 million. Partially offsetting improvements in our segment operating performance is an increase in our unallocated expenses for severance charges related to reduction in force announced last week in our MST business area and a net increase in expenses for our deferred compensation plans. The net increase in operating earnings resulted in an increase to our earnings per share guidance of $0.20 to –to $9.40 to $9.70 per share. And finally, we increased our expectations for cash from operations by $100 billion to equal or better than $4.3 billion. Chart 11 shows our updated outlook for both sales and segment profit by business area and ties the guidance updates from the previous chart. On Chart 12, we provide our initial view of our expectations for 2014. We believe sales next year will be only slightly below the 2013 level with growth in our Aeronautics business area offsetting reduction in our IS&GS and Space Systems business areas, while both Missiles and Fire Control and Mission Systems and Training are expected to be relatively comparable to their 2013 levels. And we expect our segment operating margins to be lower than this year’s record level, but above the 11.5% its level in total as we experience the dilutive effect of F-35 production growth in Aeronautics, as we described for several quarters along with the absence of several non-recurring benefits in the other business areas this year. We expect our FAS/CAS pension adjustment will provide income of $150 million in 2014 after several years of reducing our reported earnings. Our assumptions that led to the favorable adjustment, our 75 basis points increase from the discount rates to 4.75%, a low single-digit return on assets in 2013 and $1 billion in pension funding in 2014. Finally, we have our summary on Chart 13. We’ve had outstanding performance all during 2013 and we expect that to continue and result in a very solid year, particularly in this dynamic environment. With our current portfolio as well as our enhanced focus on international expansion, we like our strategic positioning heading into the next few years. We’ve provided outstanding value to shareholders this year from both a total shareholder return perspective as well as with cash return to shareholders and while we’re providing high-level trend information today, we’ll provide our usual detailed guidance during the January call. With that, we’re ready for your questions. Stephanie?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.
Jason M. Gursky – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hey, Jason. Good Morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
Jason M. Gursky – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Marillyn and Bruce, so I was wondering if you could just walk us through the assumptions on your – with your major programs that are embedded in your outlook for 2014, just so some of the building blocks and kind of track progress as we go along?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Jason, I’ll give you a high-level view. Marillyn has something to add, I’ll throw on a couple of other or she could throw on a couple topics as well. So maybe just starting with the biggest business area Aeronautics, probably the topic that you’d be curious about is the aircraft quantity changes say from this year to next year. So think of the F-35 quantities, we’re going to finish the year probably around the 36 aircraft deliveries or so, we expect that to grow somewhat next year to maybe 38, maybe a couple more than that, but somewhere in that range. Our F-16 deliveries this year are 13 aircrafts. That is expected to grow perhaps about 15 aircraft next year. C-130Js, I think, we’re going to do about 24 to 25. There is one that’s kind of on the bubble of delivering this year and next year, but if it happens this year, it will be 25. Even if that happens this year, we still think we’ll stay steady at about the 24 aircraft level next year. In C-5, this one is ramping up between 2013 and 2014. We’re going to deliver somewhere between, I’ll say, 5 to as many as 8 this year, but in any event, we think we’ll grow that number to 10 aircraft next year, and the reason we are a little hesitant on giving the numbers for 2013 is because of some of the activities that led to the de-book this quarter relative to some of the over and above works that we’re experiencing in those aircraft that could cause delay in some of those deliveries this year. If I think around the other business areas, you should think, we are seeing a slight reduction in quantities of some of our Air and Missile products associated with the PAC-3 program, but that’s more than offset at Missiles and Fire Control by increases in the THAAD production quantities, think about both domestically as well as with the recently completed UAE international order. We have no commercial satellites or commercial launches next year in our Space Systems business. We expect to have obviously no large programs that jump out on our IS&GS business area, but we expect to see a continued downward trend within IS&GS probably somewhere in the -- I think of that as the high single-digit range level between 2013 and 2014, so that probably covers a bunch of program Jason, there may be others you want to hear about, and if so, others can ask on the call when we go down to further questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Richard T. Safran – The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner: Good morning Rich.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
Richard T. Safran – The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I was interested – just kind of a two-part question on your comments, Marillyn, at the opening and on the 4Q bookings chart on Chart 9. One, should we kind of infer that there’s very little risk from the Government shutdown on 4Q bookings in terms of what the Government is going to want to contract? and then as a second part, I found it interesting that you had enough confidence in your outlook to talk about 2014 trends. Could you discuss what’s driving your confidence in your outlook, just especially given where the Congress and the Administration are? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hey Rich. I’ll give a shot at both of those and we’ll see if Marillyn has some color or commentary to provide beyond that. So fourth quarter orders, we do feel very comfortable in stating what we said relative to expectations that will grow backlog between now and the end of the year. And in particular, the reason we feel that way is that there are really very few competitive awards expected to occur in the fourth quarter and we have really no reliance on sort of new start programs in the quarter either. And just as importantly, while we’re operating in a continuing resolution environment, we believe all the awards that we’re expecting to receive in the quarter can be awarded under the continuing resolution. So just to maybe name a couple of them that we expect that will lead to the year-end backlog numbers we talked, the most significant awards are occurring in our Space Systems business. So think of that as the SBIRS Spacecraft 5 and 6 contract definitization by the end of the year, the annual -- in this case, the FY14 annual installment of the Fleet Ballistic Missile award. We expect to receive a pretty significant contract extension on the Orion program within NASA, and then if I go – that’s – those are probably the most significant, all of which are in Space. If I go to other business areas, we’re expecting things like the normal sort of FY14 award of the C-5 modernization aircraft this year. We should close hopefully on the FY13 contract to finalize or definitize the C-130 deliveries for the U.S. Government, and then we’ve got just a whole slew of sorting what I would call the numerous funding from fiscal year 2014 funds becoming available for things like JASSMs, PAC-3s, sustainment contracts across multiple business areas. So again, we feel pretty good about all those happening. Again, not anything that I would say isn’t a competitive award that could be pushed out or that we could lose in the fourth quarter that would diminish those numbers. So I think it’s a really good visibility as we go into 2014 as well. I think you asked about the 2014 guidance or maybe you expressed some surprise that we were at the levels we are, so maybe at a high level, I’ll just talk about what we’re seeing in 2014. As Marillyn said, we do expect sales to be slightly lower than 2013 and you should think of that as we are going to see growth in Aeronautics, that’s primarily coming from the F-35 production program as well as the C-5M delivery growth and numbers that I’ve talked about earlier, and that’s offsetting reductions in, as I’ve said, IS&GS and Space and Missiles and Fire Control and MST again are fairly comparable. Margins, again, we expect to remain above 11.5%. and I’ve talked in quarters past about what I like to refer to as sort of the algebra effect of the F-35, where we get higher volume on the F-35 program at lower margins than the overall margins of Aeronautics and that has the effect of lowering margins in aero overall. Missiles and Fire Control and IS&GS, I would think are going to be relatively comparable to 2013, whereas Space and MST, probably a little lower than where we experienced this year, but still very strong relative to recent history on those – in both of those business areas and this is due to a number of non-recurring events, positive events that occurred in 2013. Space also has the lower equity earnings expectation in 2014 compared to 2013. So Rich, maybe just to sum up, 2014, I would say from a margin perspective, looks very similar to 2013 when we began the year just without sort of performance improvements that we have experienced throughout 2013 that we’ve yet to obviously experience in 2014. Maybe one last note on 2014, you should see the tax rate in 2014 increase a little bit over 2013. You’ll recall we actually had two tranches, if you will, of R&D tax credit in the year 2013. So, probably more than you wanted to know there, Rich, but hopefully that covers your question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
Doug Stuart Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner: Good morning.
Doug Stuart Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC:
. :
Marillyn A. Hewson: So Doug, I would just say to that point you know when we gave some insight earlier in the year about what we expected on the impact to sequestration, it really was looking across all of businesses, we did recognize that our shorter cycle business like IS&GS would have a more significant near-term impact. But that was juts modeling that Bruce and his team did just to kind of take a look at what was the outlook for the year of things that could be impacted, we have not seen the impact and so it wasn’t really just because of IS&GS. IS&GS is – because it has a large IT infrastructure work and support and the information technology area, has been impacted because that’s an area that the Government can cut back on pretty readily. We do – it is – as I said, it is a short shorter cycle business, where we see growth there, potential growth where as in the cyber security arena, but it’s fairly a new area for us or we continue to see some offset of growth there. Bruce, I don’t if you want to maybe add some other…
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes maybe just, I think you asked a question about where we’re seeing that maybe by the LOVs, the civil, defense and intelligence. And so we’re actually seeing little bit of growth in our defense business and a lot of that’s because we’ve won – going back to Marillyn’s, kind of we’ve won several sort of cyber activities from competitors sort of – no we refer to as playing offense if you will in that arena, so we’ve been successful on it. And that’s one of the reasons why the defense business is growing this year over last year. As we looked next year, there’s not as many of those sorts of competitions coming up, I believe all three lines of the business civil, defense and intelligence in next year’s numbers as we said here today though, we’re expecting to reduce compared to 2013. And I think that’s just sort of the – a combination of two things, one that is what I’ve always said when you’re the largest provider of IT Services to the Federal Government for 18 straight years now, I believe. That when the federal government’s budget goes down, you are likely to go down as well; we expect that to happen again in 2014. And the other side of that is, I’ll say we have within the numbers that I talked, within the ranges that I’ve talked in the trend information so that considered the growth [ph] and ongoing sequestration level impact this year as well. So the combination of those two events is what we see happening within IS&GS. I always like to close that by saying, at some point, IT spending has to increase. You cannot continually reduce IT spending for the Federal Government and expect to provide the services the population expects. In some point, it will turn the other way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is actually Elizabeth in for Ron today.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Elizabeth.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. We see – it’s actually seeing Boeing really emphasize recently their Partnering for Success program, where they are trying to get 15% of their suppliers. And we were just wondering, with all the cash that you’re returning to shareholders and the DoD under so much pressure, at what point do you think the DoD sort of tries to implement its own Partnering for Success and take 15% from the defense contractors?
Bruce L. Tanner: Well, I’ll let Marillyn state from her perspective, Elizabeth, I don’t think we’ve ever stopped Charles to do what we think makes sense economically and from an affordability perspective with our supply chain. And we maybe have a little different views, there has been some – and we think the real ability to have supply chain starts actually with the designs that we come up with and how we can make those more affordable to build and sustain going forward. So it’s not something that we woke up overnight and realize that we had the correct elements for our supply chain to become affordable. We are probably two-thirds of our costs to sales today are in the supply chain. If we are going to be affordable, it’s going to have to include our supply chain and always has and that’s the focus that we do today. We have, I would argue, very good relationships with our supply chain. We have annual sessions, where we meet with them. Actually Marillyn has spoken to that group in mass to show the emphasis that we place on our supply chain and expectations not just of affordability, but of quality as schedule timeliness and alike. So this is something that we put in place for quite sometime that is not a new item of course.
Marillyn A. Hewson: I would add to that, Elizabeth, I think if you are asking is our customer treating us as their supplier in a fashion that they were going to put some push on us to be more affordable, they have been. I mean, that is a – they have been very clear that is a top priority for them. They are dealing with very significant budget constraints and increasing global security demand. So they are challenged and, across our industry, they have a press for us to all to be more affordable in solutions that we provide them and how we manage our business. It’s not something that is new to us. We’ve been very proactive as leaders in the industry to drive down our cost and we have taken actions to reduce our footprint. We have had to take some painful actions in reducing our workforce at times to adjust to the business base. We are investing in technologies to provide them with a more affordable product. So we take the weight out or we make it – overall total cost lower. A lot of things that we are doing to support our customers drive for affordability, and at the same time, they offer incentive provisions to get in cost savings because it is so critically important to them. So in some of our contracts, we have those types of incentives to encourage us to continue to drive costs down. So as Bruce said, we manage our supply chain. It’s an ongoing effort on our part to make sure that we get the best value from them in terms of costs, schedule, quality and at the same time, we want to provide our customer with the most affordable solutions and the most technically capable solutions for what their needs are.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks so much, and great performance again.
Bruce L. Tanner: Thank you, Cai.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thank you.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co. LLC: So I have a two-part question. First, you talked about sales being down modestly next year. Could you talk about international, if that’s growing, what sort of growth do you see in international and what are the key drivers? And secondly, DoD as it looks at the fiscal 2015 budget, had some priority programs and some bill payer programs, potential bill payer programs, included in those are C-130, C-5 and LCS. Maybe you could comment on your thoughts as to whether those programs you think are at risk in the FY15 budget? Thanks.
Marillyn A. Hewson: So on the international growth side, we certainly continue to see growth in F-35. In fact, over the next five years, close to half of the orders will be international deliveries for the F-35 as we move forward. On C-130J, there continues to be a demand for the C-130J and we continue to sell F-16s around the world. So we see growth in those areas. Missile defense is another very important element for us in our international growth, Bruce talked about that and PAC-3 and of course, we have our operations for Aegis Ashore, and then, we do see other opportunities for us as we look forward into the – in the satellite, commercial satellite arena, and cyber security and our IT arena for growth in the sale and international growth. On the F-15 priorities, you mentioned C-130, LCS and C-5, all of those are part of our – of the strategic management review that was done by the U.S. Government. They are high priority programs and, in addition to those, I think Missile Defense continues to be a high-priority program.
Bruce L. Tanner: And the another thing I would add Cai is, I was a little surprised to hear C-130 mentioned in that comment, where one of the few problems in the DoD that’s actually is being considered for a multi-year program to buy an additional 79 aircraft for a couple of the services right now. I think that’s got strong support, it obviously has reduced – affordability aspect to it versus buying them on individual fiscal years that has I think been well received by our customers and we expect that to happen. So that’s one that caught my ear a little bit, somewhat of a surprise when you had that to discussion there.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi David are you on mute?
David E. Strauss – UBS Securities LLC: Hey good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hey there.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
David E. Strauss – UBS Securities LLC: Good morning Marillyn. I wanted to ask you about back on sequestration. So when you saying in the release that you assumed all impact known associated with sequestration, just so I’m clear that that you’re assuming inherently in that that sequestration relates to fiscal 2014 comes through as we know announced another $15 billion to $20 billion cut off of to the total DoD budgets. And then the last part of my question, maybe if you could walk us through Bruce, I think back in January, maybe within the airport [ph] you put together that side that showed that in terms of the total revenues that would be impacted by sequestration in 2013 were in like 20%. Where does that number move to in 2014, or in other words how much of your – what proportion you think of your revenues will actually be impacted by sequestration in 2014? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes. Okay thank you David. It’s a good question. So let me give you maybe a long windy answer on the sequestration impacts for next year. I think I’ll cover hopefully both of your questions in this answers. If not again maybe you can come back on and ask the question again, but. So we still think sequestration how that impacts 2014, is broken up from our business area perspective than the sort of the long cycle businesses and short cycle. We always refer to aeronautics and space for instance as long cycle businesses. But there are also large parts of Missiles and Fire Control and Mission Systems and Training that are also really considered to be long cycle businesses, as well. So you should think of those as, in my words being relatively insulated part of the effects to sequestration in FY 2014, because most of their calendar year 2014 sales are from prior fiscal year funded activities or prior fiscal year funded backlog. That also says there’s not probably as much upside as sequestration improves over what our expectations are either in those long cycle businesses. Our short cycle businesses and primary one being the IS&GS, but also has smaller parts Missiles and Fire Control, Mission Systems and Training as well. We faced some pretty good reduction into the numbers that we’re expecting relative to the guidance, assuming the trend information we provided to the slightly less than 2013 sales those reductions are planned in that outlook already. And we think that pretty much captures what we think will happen under a sequestration environment, under a lot of different scenarios that we can think of. And the reason for that is while we say they are short cycle businesses, each one of those businesses IS&GS, the service is part of MFC, the service is part of MST and backlog from prior year funding is actually greater than one time sales in each case. So, there was not as long or as not as significant in terms of the backlog as the long cycle business and there is definitely more current year award to current year sales going on in those business areas. It is more insulated than perhaps you might think, and I think we experienced that ourselves and we try to do the modeling at the start of this year that we actually have more insulation in my words that maybe we – maybe we would otherwise thought we had at the start of the year. There is also the aspect next year that we don’t want to lose track and back to I guess Cai’s question. We do expect international growth for the next year both in terms of absolute dollar as well as on a percent of sales base. So that helps to mitigate any down side we’re seeing from the sequestration impact as well, and finally at least as we’ve looked at it, we think there is minimal – if there is really any reliance on 2013 unobligated funds, balance that’s left, the outstanding at the end of the fiscal year to become 2014 sales for Lockheed Martin. So if, if those funds were to evaporate, if those funds were to be used to offset FY 2014 sequestration reductions, we think again, we’re again insulated from that aspect as well. So hopefully that covers the two questions you had there David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is opened.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning everybody.
Bruce L. Tanner: Morning Noah.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs & Co.: I guess I’m trying to figure out how the parse – to me revenue being down slightly is a positive surprise given what the budget is doing, and that you are the Bellwether in sense. And I hear you saying and I know that you have well positioned the favorite programs and I obviously hear you saying no that it’s a long cycle business. I guess, I’m trying to sort of quantify or parse out, how much of each of those two items it really is in 2014, because if it’s almost entirely just favored programs, that would suggest you could move back to actually growing sooner than later if sequestration is the last cut. Whereas if it’s long, if it’s more being long cycle than it is favored programs, that would suggest you actually have several more years of not really being able to grow the top line even if sequestration is the last cut?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, so interesting question, Noah, and I’ll see if I can parse my answers to the question the way you parsed your questions. as we look into 2014, I think one of the things that may surprise some folks as going forward is that we’re actually probably seeing more growth in the F-35 program in next year the number that we are trending towards, the slightly less than $45 billion next year, that maybe a lot of people would have expected. So just in big numbers, the F-35 is going to be 15% or 16% of the sales of the Corporation in 2013 and F-35 jointly between the development program and the production program, but all of the growth coming from the production program is probably going to grow some 15% year-over-year from 2013 to 2014. So that’s – I think that’s one of those programs, Noah that I would characterize as both long cycle and the right priority. I think the prioritization has been demonstrated continually throughout the past year, both domestically and internationally, with the support that we’re getting on the program and obviously by definition, I guess, it’s a long cycle program. I think we’ve got other programs that has same deal, the C-130, I mentioned with the multi-year, the Air and Missile Defense programs, where they’re both long cycle and high priority; LCS is another one that would fall in that category. So I’ll tell you – and I’ll let Marillyn opine here also on it, because I know she feels strongly about this, but we’ve said all along we think that we have the best portfolio in the business. We think we have the opportunity to sell that portfolio internationally, which helps to mitigate or mute the impacts of the domestic reductions. And so I don’t think that the scenario you described where we would expect to see growth depending on how sequestration plays out in 2014 is unrealistic at all.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Yes, I’d just agree with what Bruce has outlined for you. And we’ve talked, as you said yourself, we have a well positioned portfolio of programs and as Bruce outlined where we see the growth opportunities in 2014. If there is an impact with sequestration as we – there is a full impact with sequestration. We walked through where the impact will be on the shorter cycle businesses. If we don’t see that same significant level, we should expect to have some offset there and then the longer cycle business as we move on, we do see growth, continued growth in Air and Missile Defense and the F-35 and even F-16 upgrades and the number of other opportunities on C-130Js internationally as well as the multi-year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Joseph B. Nadol – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner: Good Morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
Joseph B. Nadol – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Couple of Green IT Tech questions for you, Bruce, just on the margins, maybe it would help us if you quantified a little bit the two items that you say might pressure segment margins next year. How much pressure do you see on the F-35 becoming a bigger part of the mix, because you’re 12.8% year-to-date on segment margins just seems like a 11.5%. There is a lot of room to come in ahead of 11.5% even given some of the pressures? And the second part of that is just on MST, in particular, you highlighted radar programs as being a big driver of the upside, we can see adjustments in the quarter, are you getting into a situation there, where there is – you could for a few quarters, get some upside just given that the opportunities on those contracts or is just truly do you think not sustainable? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, thanks, Joe. So let’s see the F-35, is in the reference to what’s happening with the F-35 growth and its impact on Aeronautics margin, and first off, I know you are looking at the 12.8%, but I think if you – that’s where we ended the quarter. I think that’s the highest quarter we’ve ever had in the history of the Corporation. If you go to the full year, I think, we’re looking – if you go to mid point of guidance, probably in the 12.3% to 12.4% range. So I’m not going to debate whether that’s going down or up relative to 11.5% and it obviously is, but it may not be from the 12.8% picture starting from. The only thing I tried to emphasize was on the – on a previous question was that 11.5% that we are talking about, actually looks a lot like where we started the year 2013. I forgot what we – what our guidance was in the start of the year, but it was somewhere in the 11.6% or 11.7% as I recall, it kind of feels like a similar level to me is where we started in 2013. Most years we have had positive performance improvements throughout the year that have enabled us to have benefits. We don’t count on those happening every year when we provide the initial guidance, but I think our track record for most years would say that’s been where we’ve been successful. So as I look at Aeronautics, I would expect that reduction to occur I mean from a margin perspective 2013 versus 2014, they are going to – I think if we go to the midpoint they are probably in the 11.4-ish range. And I would think that we’ll still see it somewhere in the 11% margins even with the dilutive effective of the F-35 and C-5 increases in Aeronautics. The point I’m trying to make on the – in my prepared remarks was that in particular with an MST we had I believe in the second quarter that was the highest margin in the history of MST, and we had a few contractual resolutions there that we did described in both the press release and Q which you should think of being $75-ish million or so. On top of that, we have had very good performance, you mentioned the Radar programs, those are very good. I think that’s a business that kind of stays in 11-ish range on a kind of a go-forward basis. And then you didn’t ask about it, but the one I mentioned previously, was the Space Systems Company with the joint venture in equity earnings. We had some high equity earnings this year, really associated with launch related activities. Those are expected to come down a little bit next year. Could we see the same experience with some performance out of ULA, next year as we saw this year? Yes. But are we planning on that with our guidance? Not at this point in time. So Space Systems, I’m very pleased with margins there, again this is probably the highest share in the history of space. I think that’s a business that probably stays in 12% range going into next year. So what we say here today, we are not at all just pleased with where we expect the margins to go next year and I’d say we have the same sorts of opportunities to increase those margins next year as we did this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.
Rob Stallard – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner: Good morning.
Rob Stallard – RBC Capital Markets LLC: On the F-35, on the most recent contract you signed; I was wondering if you can give us some color on how the contractual terms might have changed, and how your discussions with the customer have progressed, you could have a separate customer?
Bruce L. Tanner: Firstly. Rob, I guess, the first thing as we negotiated Lot 6 and 7 combined if you will, they are separate contracts, but we did do a – essentially, concurrently. And we did so in about six months time versus Lot 5 where we probably took about 18 months. So I think we are on a good path there. As for as contractually speaking, we do have essentially a fixed price contract and I’d say essentially, because there is a little bit of essential share on underrun there between the Government and ourselves, there is no share on the overrun. So think about fixed price in that regard and I’m trying to think Rob, I think off the top of my head, I think most other terms and conditions that we negotiated with Lot 5 carried over and so I’m looking at Marillyn here, she was very engaged in Lot 5, carried over into Lot 6 and 7. I don’t think we had much to speak of the change of anything there. So I’ll probably leave it at that.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Yes. I agree, Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Ross D. Cowley – Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning, everybody. This is actually Ross Cowley in for Rob. I just wanted to touch base on the AMDR contract, specifically find out how surprised you were when the award went to Raytheon and whether how the debriefing is going, whether this is something that you could protest?
Marillyn A. Hewson: Well, I’ll answer that. From an AMDR standpoint, we were disappointed on the decision by the Government. we did see a decrease last week and so we’re in the midst of evaluating the information. But we’ve had – we’ve been engaged on the Aegis System for the past 42 years. So we have deep understanding of that program and of the mission. So we were certainly disappointed, but we’re still on the midst of evaluation – evaluating information that came out of the debriefing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Myles A. Walton – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, hi good morning. Bruce, the cash into 2014, outside of the pension tailwind and net income, how should we think about the advances, cash taxes, any of that working capital sensitivities.
Bruce L. Tanner: And so trying to look at some paper I got in front of me, Myles, in terms of the advances. typically, what we project going forward is that our advances will come down. We don’t have a huge number of direct commercial contract plans in the 2014 timeframe that would sort of bring typical advance payments with them, most of our international growth next year comes in the form of foreign military sales contracts. So I wouldn’t expect to see the starting sorts of advances that we’ve had in the past that result in our advanced balance going on the balance sheet there. Working capital wise, I think we’re going to see some improvements there, as we kind of go through the production and we obviously have some withholds associated with the business system rule for things like Earned Value Management System that have been made pretty public that we expect to finalize and that will improve the working capital position associated with those. I think from a thinking or planning perspective, you should think of next year’s number, I think being higher than the level of cash that it’s going to generate in 2013. I know it’s been in the either in a response to question or in my prepared remarks we talked about the potential for looking in the fourth quarter additional pension contributions. Even with that, I’d say we would stay above the $4.3 billion level in 2013 and I think we’ll be north of that in 2014.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
George D. Shapiro – Shapiro Research LLC: Yes, good morning Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hey George.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
George D. Shapiro – Shapiro Research LLC: The question I have got is two parts. Last years ending funded backlog with $55 billion versus the $82 billion that you quote. Given that the funding is less assured these days, what do you figure that funded backlog will end this year? And then my second one is, I know you’ve given some color to try and mitigate why sales are only down a few percent next year. But just conceptually, I mean, you’ll be down 4% to 5% this year and next year, the budget is worse, the sequestration impact is worse. So maybe a little more clarity on why you think you’ll actually decline less next year than this year? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner: So George good questions as usual. So I’m doing this a little of the top of my head. You asked funded backlog at the end of last year, funded at the end of this year and maybe embedded in your question was, don’t you have more risk, the difference between funded and unfunded. I think the key distinct and there’s what’s obligated, versus necessarily what’s funded. The real issue from a sequestration perspective is, taking those unobligated funds and those are the ones that are really at risk S-3 as I made to comments before about, again why we think we have in 2014 a pretty good handle along what our revenue is going to be. So we don’t have a reliance on the unobligated funds turning into sales in 2014. I don’t particularly see an issue was funded backlog balance in the end of this year. I think it will be comparable, either percentage basis or an absolute basis to where we ended last year on a percentage basis relative to the ending backlog amount. So I don’t think that’s an issue that I am particularly concerned about as we sit here today. Going forward, you asked about my paraphrase, why we feel comfortable with saying we’re going to be relatively comparable to the 2013 sales, even though it appears the budget is going down more. You’re actually right with that. Going back to the question, I think, Noah asked, it is a function of our portfolio as to things that I talked about when I described the sequestration impacts. We do expect international sales to grow both on a percentage basis and on absolute dollar basis. Our single largest program, the F-35, as I said, is expected to grow 15%. We have other growth, in particular, Air and Missile Defense products have – and Missiles and Fire Control. And so for all the reasons that I went around the hone earlier by each business area, we feel pretty good about that. I mean, the things that I would think could change that dramatically, George, from what we are expecting to see now as if sort of obligated, under contract programs were terminated or partially terminated. And if that were to happen, sort of all bets are off, but that’s not a scenario that we’re counting on or guiding towards at all when we give our trend information for 2014.
Jerry F. Kircher, III: Stephanie, I think we’re maybe a minute past to the hour here. So I’m going to maybe turn it back over to Marillyn for final thoughts.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. As we conclude today, I believe our third quarter results and increased guidance, illustrate the solid position and performance of the Corporation to provide solutions to customers and value to shareholders. In an uncertain budget environment, our strong backlog of work, our solid balance sheet, our robust cash generation and the exceptional execution of our employees, will continue to propel our Corporation forward. I am confident in our future because of the outstanding performance, innovation and integrity of our workforce, as we support our customers and their essential missions. Thanks again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in January. Stephanie, that concludes our call today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day. And welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Jerry Kircher:  Thank you, Sahid and good morning. I’d like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

Marillyn Hewson:  Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I begin I want to offer my appreciation and congratulations to our Lockheed Martin team for their continuing outstanding performance and the achievement of strong second quarter financial and operational results. As we continue to operate in a dynamic and challenging environment, their efforts and focus have our Corporation poised for continued success in delivering value to shareholders and solutions to customers. While Bruce will cover the financials in more detail later, I’ll highlight some key financial achievements from the quarter that included growing earnings per share to $2.64, 11% above last year's second quarter level, expanding segment operating margin to a record level 13.4% and achieving an increase of 110 basis points above last year's level and generation of $600 million in cash from operations after making $750 million in pension contributions. Our continued strong cash flow is foundational to our cash deployment strategy to generate value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. In the second quarter, we repurchased over 4.5 million shares of our stock, more than double the 2.2 million shares we pre-purchased in the second quarter last year. We deployed $465 million for share repurchase through this quarter and paid slightly over $370 million in dividends. Through the first half of 2013, we returned over $1.6 billion or approximately 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, I would characterize the second quarter financial performance as broad based across all business areas with results exceeding our expectations. This strong performance enabled us to increase our 2013 financial guidance for operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. Bruce will cover some of the specific drivers for the improved performance in his briefing.  Before discussing other achievements this quarter, I’d like to outline the status of DOD budgets. Since we last spoke in April, not much has changed in the budget environment. FY13 DOD budget appropriations have been enacted and incorporate the $37 billion in budget reductions required under sequestration. Our sum budget reduction actions are being implemented by the government, they have to implement most of the required spending cuts. To date, we have seen minimal impact to our portfolio programs with actions taken primarily limited to our shorter cycle business. Customers are continuing to determine how they will implement the cuts mandated by sequestration, which they’re required to do before the end of the fiscal year on September 30th. And we are working closely with them as they explore host of potential scenarios. For FY ’14, Congressional deliberations on the budget are continuing. The President proposed baseline defense budget remains at $526 billion without inclusion of the $52 billion in sequestration budget reduction that went into effect in March 2013. The Department of Defense has finalized the Strategic Management Review that reexamined policy and program priorities to account for the sequestration imposed cuts. This review will be used to aide DoD and continuing to formulate decisions on post-sequestration program and budgets for 2013 and 2014. Our future budget levels remain uncertain, the strategic need and support of number of our key programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, littoral combat ship and C-130J remains intact. We will continue to work with customers and respond the changes as required when budget positions are finalized by the government. Turning to the operational performance, our five business areas continue to execute with exceptional focus and skill in providing critical products and services to customers. Of the numerous accomplishments in the quarter, I’d like to highlight our continued success in missile defense activities, provide a status of our expanding international work and finish with an update on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. First, with the growing threat of ballistic missile proliferation, the need for proven, reliable, interceptor systems is becoming more acute daily, providing defense system design to prevent the catastrophic damage that can be inflicted on civilian population centers and national infrastructure by offensive missile is essential to our nation and alliance. Our portfolio of interceptor system consisting of Aegis, Patriot, THAAD and MEADS will provide layered coverage intended to defeat missile press post by world nations. This quarter, our Patriot 3 missile conducted a ripple fire test that successfully intercepted and destroyed two different targets at White Sands Missile Range. This test was the first time a multi-target engagement was performed against both the Ballistic Missile Target and the Cruise Missile Target, and it success provide a clear demonstration of the design maturity and increasing capability of the PAC-3 configuration. In addition to the Patriot test events, our Second Generation Aegis Ballistic Missile System successfully launched and guided a missile to engage and destroy a separating short-range Ballistic Missile Target. This test validated the ability of the Aegis system to engage increasingly more challenging enemy threat. It also marked an important milestone for the phased adaptive approach to missile defense in Europe. This approach will combine a land based Aegis Ashore site in Romania with a traditional Aegis system aboard navy ships to provide unique missile defense protection on the continent. These multiple successful launch again demonstrates the accuracy, robustness and technological advances we are incorporating into our missile defense products. These advances will ensure we can provide defense system to customers that can respond to an ever evolving threat. With customers depending on these systems in their times of need, it is an honor and responsibility to provide affordable and proven systems for our nation and alliance. The next area I want to highlight is the continued expansion of our international business portfolio. This quarter we secured new awards and made deliveries to new customers as we extended our international presence. New awards were received across multiple business areas and consisted of aeronautics receipt, I mean, award for 18 additional F-16 aircraft for Iraq. This award now extends the F-16 production line in Fort Worth, Texas well into 2017. Mission systems and training secured new award for Japan to upgrade Aegis Multi-Mission Signal Processor and other equipment on their Ballistic Missile Defense Ship. Missiles and Fire Control received multiple international awards and clearly had order from Saudi Arabia to provide longbow fire control radars for attacked helicopters, an order from Finland to provide integration support of our JASSM Missile into Finnish Fighter Aircraft, an award to provide Patriot Missile Defense Equipment to Kuwait. International deliveries in the quarter consisted of delivery of the first C130J Super Hercules aircraft to both the Republic of Tunisia and to Israel. The delivery to Tunisia marks the first to an African country, an entry into a new customer set. Tunisia becomes the 15th country to select the proven, low risk and affordable C130J for its air fleet requirement. Expansion of international sales remains a key component of our corporate strategy. And we're on a path to grow international content from approximately 17 total sales last year to at least 20% in the next few years. Finally turning to the F-35 program, multiple key accomplishments were achieved in the quarter. And you can feel the momentum accelerating throughout the program. Last month I attended the F-35 CEO roundtable in Fort Worth, chaired by Frank Kendall, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Logistics and the programs status briefing by Lieutenant General Bogdan, the F-35 Program Executive Officer. Attendees included Representatives from all nine-partner nations and our teammates on the F-35 industry team. The meeting reaffirmed just how much progress the F-35 team has made. The customer expressed a renewed confidence in the future of the program and there is a strong sense of partnership across the whole team. We know a lot of work still must be done and at the same time, it’s clear that the tremendous efforts of the team are paying off.  One of the key accomplishments this quarter was the declaration by the Department of Defense of initial operating capability dates for all three F-35 variants, 2015 for the Stovall aircraft, 2016 for the CTOL aircraft and either late 2018 or early 2019 for the CD aircraft for the U.S. Navy. These dates reflect the confidence the customer has in the Lightning 2 and in our team. Our job is to execute on the program, to make sure we meet these critical dates for our customers and deliver the capabilities of this aircraft to our warfighters and allies.  Beyond the establishment of IOC dates, the program achieved a number of key milestones in the second quarter including the delivery of the first F-35C carrier variant to the U.S. Navy. This delivery was important as all three variants are now at Elgin Air Force Base, Florida, where they're training pilots and maintenance personnel for this next generation fighter; completion of high angle of attack testing by the F-35A which is a key measure of aircraft maneuverability; completion of the first vertical take-off by an F-35B Stovall aircraft and the successful first in-flight missile launch by the F-35A variant. Production activities continue to ramp up with delivery of 12 aircraft in the quarter. And we remain solidly on track to deliver at least 36 aircraft this year. The program tempo is accelerating and we currently have our 100 aircraft in final assembly.  In the area of customer relationships and contractual events, we were pleased with the Australia’s reconfirmation of its plans to procure 100 CTOL joint strike fighters for its national defense. We look forward to reviving these revolutionary aircraft to one of our key strategic partnering countries. As we continued to work to bring down the cost of the aircraft, we were pleased with reduction in acquisition and operating and support costs reflected in the 2012 Selected Acquisition Report issued by the DoD in June. This was the first year the cost reduction was noted since program inception and we will work with the F-35 Joint Program Office to implement further cost savings measures to secure additional decreases in the total program cost. The top priority of the government and the contractor team is to continue to cost effectively build and deliver the F-35’s unprecedented fifth generation capabilities to the warfighter.  I’ll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our financial performance and then we’ll open it up the line for questions. 
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning everyone. My comments will refer to the web charts that we included in our earnings release today if you would like to follow along. Let's start with Chart 3, an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $11.4 billion, 4% below our results from a year ago, but higher than our first quarter results and as with the first quarter were above our expectations. Segment operating margin was as record 13.4%, a 110 basis points improvement over the second quarter last year. Our earnings per share were also up significantly to $2.64, an 11% increase over last year’s results. We generated $623 million in cash from operations well above the outlook I provided in the first quarter. We returned over $800 million of cash to our shareholders including the repurchase of 4.5 million shares for $465 million. And as a result of our performance, we’re increasing our outlook for operating profit, EPS and cash from operations. So we’re very pleased with our results for the first half of the year. Chart four shows our sales in the second quarter this year versus last year. Aeronautic sales equaled our results last year as lower quantities of F-16, F-22 and C-130 aircraft were offset by higher volume on F-35 production contracts and C-5 deliveries. IS&GS sales were lower due to reduced volume primarily in our intelligence line of business. Missiles and Fire Control continued their strong performance with an 11% increase from sales coming primarily from air and missile defense programs. Mission Systems and Training sales were down 12% due primarily to the end of deliveries of the PTDS program last year. And finally, space systems was 13% lower than last year due primarily to the delivery of two commercial satellites from the second quarter of last year and none this year. Moving to chart five in our segment operating results, despite our sales being down 4%, operating profit was up 4% driven by the significant improvement in operating margin of 13.4%. At the end of this quarter, we had strong program execution across all of our business areas that we’ll show in the next chart. Chart six shows our segment operating margins by business area. Three of our five business areas increased operating margin compared to the second quarter of last year with MST having the largest increase due to the settlement of certain contractual matters and better performance in our training and logistics business. Missiles and Fire Control continue to have excellent results and the increase this quarter was due to improved performance in air and missile defense programs, tactical missile programs and fire control programs. Space system’s margin improved primarily due to the increased equity earnings from United Launch Alliance, reflecting the mix of launch related activities in the quarter compared with last year. IS&GS’ margin was flat relative to last year’s second quarter results and aeronautic’s margin was down this quarter due to the absence of a favorable contractual resolution on the F-22 program which occurred in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusting for the contractual resolution, aeronautic’s margin were similar to last year. Moving onto chart seven. Our EPS grew 11% over the results from the second quarter of last year to $2.64 per share due primarily to improved operational performance. And on our pension adjusted basis, our EPS was $2.87 per share. We’ll turn to chart eight. We’ll discuss our cash returned to shareholders in the quarter. We returned over $800 million to shareholders in the quarter with share repurchases in excess of dividends paid. Compared with the second quarter of last year, we repurchased more than double the amount of shares. With the increase in our stock price in the quarter, we saw higher level of option exercise and accordingly, we repurchased additional stock to mitigate share count dilution. On chart nine, we’ll look at cash return to shareholders on a year-to-date basis. We had a strong year-to-date cash -- we had strong year-to-date cash from operations of $2.7 billion and free cash flow of over $2.4 billion. Through the first half, we returned almost $1.7 billion or nearly 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders. And our share repurchases of over $900 million will exceed the level of dividends paid thus far in the year and greatly exceed to roughly $700 million have seen in our full-year guidance at the start of the year. Moving onto chart 10, we will discuss our updated view of guidance for the year. As was the case last quarter, we saw minimal impact to our sales in the second quarter as a result of sequestration actions and we are maintaining the sales guidance provided last quarter. On the other hand, we are increasing our outlook for segment operating profit by $225 million to recognize the strong performance to the first half of the year. As a result of the increase in our segment operating profit, we are also increasing our outlook for earnings per share by $0.40 to a new level of $9.20 to $9.50 per share and also reflecting strong performance thus far. We are increasing our cash from operations guidance by $200 billion to a new level of greater than or equal to $4.2 billion. Chart eleven shows our updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We’re increasing our outlook in four to five business areas. MFT’s outlook is now $75 million higher, Missiles and Fire Control’s is now $70 million higher and both Aeronautics and Space are $40 million higher than our guidance last quarter. And turning to chart twelve I’ll summarize by noting that we’re very pleased with the results for the first six months of the year and they reflect our program execution, the strength of our portfolio and the focus of our work force during these dynamic times. With that, we’re ready for your questions, Sahid.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And in the interest of time, we’re limiting each to one question. Please return to the queue for any follow up questions. Our first question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays: Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on the order outlook, obviously the book-to-bill was about 0.8 by my calculation and it looks like obviously you have a plan to have a pretty big step up there in Q3 and Q4 to hit the levels you talked about on the previous call. You said you haven’t really still seen any impact from sequester, but I wondered if you could give us an update on your expectations for orders and if anything’s changed and for last quarter and how about that will shape up for what you’re thinking about 2014? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, thanks Carter. So I’ll start up by saying, actually we’re slightly ahead of where we probably would be at this point of second quarter. I tried to key that up. I think either the first quarter or the top end of the year last year. But we’re actually tracking that of expected or slightly ahead of plan. There’s up several items and I ask, probably just kind of run down the list by business area, just give you an idea of what we’re expecting to happen over the next few quarters. So the second biggest item obviously is the closure of the last six and seven negations for F-35 and when that happens Carter, I mean think of the increase in orders as being somewhere in the $4.5 to $5 billion amount for just that one closure of contract negotiations if you will. And we’re expecting that to happen in the third quarter. Aren’t we making good progress that, Marillyn can fill-in some of the details for you if you’d like at a later point in the call? We also have a number of competitive orders. We’re watching an MST in the third quarter including Space Fence and the Air and Missile Defense Radar Program AMDR. We also have an Aegis order for the basic Aegis program, collectively those are about a billion dollars again that we’re expecting in the third quarter. Missiles and Fire Control has both domestic and an FMS order for the THAAD program that’s expected in the third quarter, so I think of this as the annual buy from the army on the domestic side and one of our international customers tagging on for that order. And that’s -- I think I said worth about a $1.5 billion in the third quarter. IS&GS is usual, is nothing -- no one program individually significant, but the third quarter is expected to be higher than either the second or the first. And then, Carter, as we look forward I would expect that the fourth quarter as usual will be our highest quarter of the year.  Now just to sort of summarize all that, I think the third quarter -- you should think of us probably being back at a level maybe slightly higher than where we are or where we were in the first quarter and if all comes as I just laid out including some of those competitions, we should end the year pretty close back about at the $80 billion like I’ve been talking about the past two quarters.
Carter Copeland, Barclays: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Just Bruce or Marillyn and this could go to both of you, but I wanted to just talk about what we learned in the interim between last call and this call from DOD on sequester. I think about $1 billion was taken from 2013 money for F-35 and it appears to cut, I think five aircrafts from the air force and about two from the navy and the marine core with the reminder of the billion being RDT&E. So to what extent if at all does this impact LRIP-6 and probably more likely LRIP-7 negotiations? And how should we think about that those Lot seven aircraft from the 29 aircraft originally funded in ’13?
Marillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question Rob. First, I’d say that, our customer really has not come out with a definitive position on how they’re going to take into account sequestration. I know there has been lot of speculation. I’m not going to speculate with you on what they’ll come out with. We’re working closely with them. They’re looking at different scenarios of how they are, if they’ll address it. One thing I will say is that they’re very supportive of the F-35 and we’ll just have to see how it comes out. We’ve seen in terms of any impact that we might see on F-35 that we backfill probably by international opportunities because as you can see that’s where we’re going to ramp up. In fact, we look over the next five years close to 50% of our orders will come from international customers. So we’ve got to just wait until they come forward with or wait until the Department of Defense comes forward with what their plans are and then we’ll adjust accordingly.
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. Rob, I’d like to just add a little bit to what Marillyn said. I think the negotiations on six and seven were clearly targeted to sort of keep the quantities sort of pre-sequestration. So think of the negotiations that we hope to close fairly quickly here as being the same quantities we have embedded within the fiscal year themselves not adjusted for sequestration. And I think Secretary Kendall has been pretty vocal in the press about trying to keep quantities and trying to prevent sort of the reopening of contracts. And so we’re optimistic if that kind of plays out well for that negotiation that were not impacted to the level that you talked about. As Marillyn said, we’re watching the FY14 budget closely but at least, as we’ve sort of done comparisons in particular the President’s budget, there seems to be more reductions to non-aircrafts elements of the program than aircraft programs, which we think from a sort of a billed rate in bringing the overall cost profile of the program down is the right move from obviously our perspective.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: So, Bruce, if I want to understand what you both just said, it’s not so much about quantities, it’s more about total dollars and these dollars don’t necessarily come off of unit price but from other areas of the program?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. I think you said it just right, Rob. In fact, I’ve said in a media that this morning and I think I’ve said in my prepared remarks that we’ve seen less impact from sequestration sort of red large than we expected to through this part of the year. I’ll say frankly from our perspective, I can’t speak obviously for all of the industry, but I think the Pentagon Secretary, all the way, up and down to Pentagon has been very prudent in the way that they’ve managed the sequestration impacts and I think they’ve done a very nice job doing that from an industry’s perspective.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citigroup.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: Good morning, everyone. Bruce …
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Jason.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: Bruce, this question is for you, in the slide deck you’ve got a line in there on chart nine that says you are on track to exceed full year cash return commitments. You’ve done that on the repurchases the $926 million versus the $700 million, but keeping in mind that the goal here was to keep the share count roughly by an offset dilution? So can you just provide a little bit more update on what exactly you mean by on track to exceed for your expectations, is that around the share count itself or is that a comment more around the $900 million versus the $700 million?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. Probably neither actually, Jason, it is more of our long standing goal is to give 50% of more free cash flow. I’ll say we pretty much get there, obviously we just did and so, in fact I was saying, did $700 million plus the dividends for the year. So we’ve exceeded that already on a year-to-date basis. And I think probably embedded your question is so what is the outlook looks like for the rest of the year and how does that expect to play out. I’ve got to believe with the stock sitting where it is today in the level of options that have been exercised to date that those will continue if the stock stays where it is today. It’s actually up a couple dollars at least last I looked at it today, which will probably continue that trend and just to give you some perspective there, we’ve had 4 million, we had 4 million options exercised in the second quarter of 2013 compared to just over 1 million in the second quarter of 2012. So, you know if that trend continues that will be obviously the motivation for us to continue to share repurchases at the level we’ve had in the past but that will be dependent upon us watching that option exercise and its effect of the dilution of the share count. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with RBC Capital Markets.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks so much. Good morning. 
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning. 
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Rob. 
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets: (Inaudible) a follow-up of Jason’s question. If you're obliged to carry on buy back stock at this sort of rate, does this jeopardize or impact on your first ability to increase the dividend debt force? 
Bruce Tanner: Well, I guess you can’t do that to infinity without impacting the ability to pay dividends back, Rob, but honestly I don’t think, you know, if you look at our track record, in terms of what we’ve done with dividend increases and you know, I think that’s probably always the best indicator of what we’ll do in the future. The one thing that’s kind of interesting about where we sit from the amount of options that are still outstanding and have yet to be exercised, I want to say there is about $15 million, 15 million, excuse me, shares of options that are outstanding, about 12.5 or so are vested and the other, the remainder unvested. But we’ve kind of weeded out, if you will, sort of the low dollar option amounts. So the options that are being exercised today come with, you know, option prices at the $80 plus per share for the most part.  So you know think of the incremental difference between sort of buying back the shares to offset the dilution and the price of the options that are being exercised is maybe less than they would have been years ago when we had some options at the $35 to $45 levels. So that’s something to mitigate. What you might think of in terms of the overall level of cash sort of required to continue to share repurchases. At this point I think we’ve got the flexibility to do that. we're still looking at, you know, with the guidance we’ve provided this year, $4.2 billion, our overall capital, you know, somewhere in the billion dollars, maybe a little less. So free cash flow of $3.2 billion we started out, I think we’ve got what, $2.8 billion on the balance sheet as we ended the quarter.  So, you know, I still think we’ve got the fire power to continue to do that going forward in part because of the reasons I’ve just said with the benefits coming from those options when they are exercised. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. 
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Hi. Good morning everybody. 
Bruce Tanner: Good morning. 
Bruce Tanner: Hey, [Tom].
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: If I move to the low end of the revenue guidance range which you’ve indicated would happened under sequestration for 2013, the back half of the year would experience something like an 8% organic revenue decline. In that, what is your assumption for the growth rate of U.S. DoD versus U.S. non-DoD versus international? And then to extend you're willing or able to, you know, can you talk about how much different we should assume those would be in 2014, if at all?
Bruce Tanner: Help me with the last part of your question, Noah, if you would. Please tell me more about what you're looking for, the comparison of ’14 to ’13, what was that?
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Yes. Basically what I’m saying is you know is there any reason why we should not take those growth rates you’ve assumed in the back half of ’13 and carry them forward into ’14 in the center or sequestration as [stepping].
Bruce Tanner: Yes. So I think the first part of your question was if we could kind of squeeze for the back half of the year, it looks like we're down, I think you said 8%. I think that’s about right. Noah, I don’t have it off the top of my head. I will say that if we, as I said, to answer a previous question, as we look at the overall year and where we sit to the first half of the year, our sales were ahead of expectations in the first quarter. Our sales were ahead of expectations in the second quarter albeit not as much as they were in the first quarter. So we are tracking better than expected for the first half. The $825 million that we kind of came up with point towards the low end of the guidance was sort of -- as we used in the past sort of a parametric or a mathematically derived number that frankly we haven't seen materialize as quickly or as much as we thought when we did that calculations. So, I’m hopeful that we actually -- our culture towards the -- maybe little bit higher than the low end of the guidance, as we said earlier -- as I said earlier we’ve got one quarter to kind of squeeze out the fiscal year ‘13 impact for sequestration. It seems like a lot has to happen that quarter for that sort of mathematical modeling to come into fruition. As far as the build rates going into 2014, I think, we’re very similar to the situation that we were going into fiscal year 2013 in the -- we haven't seen truly the impacts in ‘13 than we had expected in large part because again I think the DoD in the Pentagon has done a fairly masterful job kind of deflecting some of that. It’s some of the expensive of operations and maintenance and some readiness issues, which are not good by any means, but in terms of the industry's perspective I think it’s been helpful. And so, we are kind of going to go into ‘14 somewhat the way we went into 2013 and there I think the -- we are going to have a similar story as I said at the start of the year where our long cycle businesses will not see much impact even if the ‘14 budget is set by sequestration. And our short cycle businesses will have that impact. But I got to believe the ability to continue to differ and push the sequestration impacts on O&M, readiness and the like will be mitigated by ‘14. So I think ‘14 versus ‘13 will be similar to what we expected to kind of happen as we enter the year ‘13 if that makes sense.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.
Rich Safran - Buckingham Research: Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Good morning.
Rich Safran - Buckingham Research: This question is either for Marillyn or Bruce. Marillyn on your comments regarding at on second tranche of the F-16 and extending the backlog to ’17. Now, I want to know if you could comment on other opportunities for the F-16 and maybe also if you could make the comment here about what you are thinking about in terms of production rates? And as long as on maybe legacy programs here, maybe you could also comment on the opportunities and the outlook for the 130J in production rates?
Marillyn Hewson: Sure, thanks for the question. So, on opportunities for F-16 as I did say with the Iraq sale that gets us out into 2017. But we also have opportunities and import for the UAE. Potentially, there are other Middle East countries. We have opportunities in South America. So, our production rate today is about 13 aircrafts per year. And it should continue on out through at least to ‘17 timeframe. And then as we see additional orders come on line, we would continue to stay on whatever rate that would lend itself to. We also have F-16 upgrade work that we are doing today which is good work for us as we, with the time line upgrade of F-16. On the C-130J, our plan this year is to deliver 24 aircrafts and we’ll continue on that rate. We have a lot of international demand for this C-130J. And we are hopeful on moving through the multi-year opportunity with the U.S. government which would be up to 83 aircraft through those opportunities in Saudi Arabia, opportunities in India. So we have the C-130J also has good opportunities.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Nadol from JP Morgan.
Joe Nadol - JP Morgan: Thanks. Very nice margins. I have actually just two quick ones. One is, Bruce, you talked earlier about the backlog in what you expect to happen by the end of the year, about $80 billion. Funded backlog, does that look at a similar profile that they were due at 55. Do -- I think at the end of last year, do you expect that to be roughly the same? And then the second question is just on the F-35 SDD. You took another reduction, profit rate reduction in the quarter. Could you just give some color on how you think that tease you up going forward on that contract, what has to happen to make that the last write down? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner:  Thanks Joe. I’ll try to take both those on. The backlog, as you said and we’re looking for a total backlog of $80 billion or so by the end of the year. I think we are around $55 billion or so of funded backlog. I wouldn’t think -- I think I would think that relationship will sort of hold pretty steady, would be my guess. Maybe a little bit higher, like think about it because I would think we’d get full funding for a good portion of that lot [6 and 7] negotiation, so that on a percentage basis, it might actually be a little higher than it is today. And as far as the SDD, you’re right. We did take a [D-book] this year, essentially similar to the one we took a year ago at this timeframe. The way I would describe that Joe, is in the quarter, we finalized an agreement with the government which we’ve been working for quite some time for the plan for earning the remaining fee on SDD and you should think of that as being both for the remaining developmental milestones on the contract as low as sort of an overall measure of performance that’s an incentive based measurement that will take place at the end of the contract. And I’ll just say that both criteria, the developmental milestone, they’re linked to specific dates and accomplishments through the remainder of the SDD period. And even more so I’ll say the sort of overall performance measures at the end of the contract which you should think of as being tied to both schedule performance and cost performance between now and the end of the contract. Both of those, I would characterize as very tough criteria for us. So this is our best estimate of how we’re going to perform against that criteria. I’d like to say that this is -- obviously I think this is our best estimate of how we’d perform against that criteria and it is a little tough maybe than what we were thinking it was when we set the numbers a year ago just on …
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Loomis from Stifel.
William R. Loomis - Stifel:  Thank you. Just staying on F-35; Bruce, you talked about the productions, the quantities are still undecided. But just from a revenue standpoint of the work you’re doing, is it still running about 15%, can we expect that to continue? And then just another questions on IS&GS with the backlog showing sequential decline and you’ve got two big wins last year with GSM and [Pulver] and we’re still declining. When do you think we might see some stability in IS&GS? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Hey, Bill. I’ll answer those. So we are about 15% of total revenue for the F-35 program. I think that number continues to increase over the next few years. I think we were somewhere in the 13-ish or so range. I’ve lost track where we were last year. So we had about a 2% increase if memory serves me right in the percentage of total F-35 compared to our total sales. That number again, I think increases going forward and then how much I would say, maybe not as much as the 13% to 15%, but still increasing between 2013 and 2014.  IS&GS, the sequential decline again, kind of as expected and the reversal I think that you talked about Bill, this is still a business that’s very much sort of orders similar to or excuse me, backlogs similar to the sales level. For us to get there, we would expect to have a greater fourth quarter which is the historical trend for IS&GS. And what I would expect to have happened is that we’ll see from an orders perspective, higher orders in both the third quarter than we saw in the first two and the fourth quarter will be higher still than the third quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.
Peter Arment - Sterne Agee:  Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce.
Marillyn Hewson:  Good morning. 
Peter Arment - Sterne Agee:  Bruce, maybe this question is for you or maybe Marillyn can take it. Just in general headcount levels, you guys have been out front on reducing your overall cost base quite a bit over the last couple of years and according to my calculation looks like headcount has come down by about 8% during that period. I mean, you are still seeing a lot of opportunities for that whether it’s early retirement programs or productivity, or just in general mandated by the overall budgets? Thanks.
Marillyn Hewson: Okay. We have taken net cap down from about 146,000 employees about two or three years ago to 116,000 now, so you are right, headcount has been coming down. We’ve taken some direct activities where we took out a number of management back when we do our voluntary separation program at that time. We will continue to adjust our business to what’s happening and our business base. So that’s what you are seeing is just the budget environment and adjusting to contractual delays or reductions that come with that. So those are the types of actions we’ll take and what we don’t know is what sequestration will bring. Certainly, if we have a significant impact on program from sequestration we’ll see additional reductions to that. So we basically saw the business to the environment that we are operating in. We are also coming out of footprint. We’ve done a lot and you’ve probably seen we reduced our capacity both shutting down facilities, as well as moving out lease space into our own space and that’s something that we’ve done for past several years. But it’s just of course we take to managing our business to make sure that we get our infrastructure and our labor force aligned with business base that we have.
Operator:
.: 
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank: Quick one and then one on pension, well, the quick one is the EACs revisions not related to revenue for the year, it looks like coming roughly flat year-on-year is that currently what’s built into the guidance? And then one on pension, Bruce, if you can kind of give us little color, obviously the rates moving higher here, it’s going to help you pretty significantly if you stick around. I think on a sensitivity basis like as a potentially $300 million, $400 million help for you for next year versus what you previously told us. As well, can you comment on that if that changing your attitude towards cash contributions, the remaining $750 million, still have as discretionary for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Myles. So EAC revisions, I think, as usual Myles your math is right, we’re kind of spot on maybe a slightly different little bit down from the first half of this year compared to the first half of the last year in terms of our overall EAC revisions. Looking forward for the rest of this year, the second half, at least in the plan we kind of expected the level that will be similar to a little bit higher than where we were last year and that could obviously change as sort of risk retirements happen quicker than we plan them obviously. But as we sit here today, overall, we would expect still be, I think last year we were about 34% overall our EAC revisions versus our total earnings, so we’re going to be right at ballpark, maybe a little higher at 35-ish or just 36% is kind of what I would expect to see. So on pension you asked about the discount rates or the interest rate changes and so forth and I’ll just -- I’ll give you a little bit of perspective, obviously we won’t set this until the end of the year. But clearly there have been changes to rates in the first half of the year that want some discussion. So interest rates so far are up, probably about 75 basis points, and our asset returns are also slightly positive as we sit here this year. But as you know, our pension adjustments that we’re talking about much more sensitive to changes in the interest rates than changes in our asset return. So you did some calculations just remind everyone else on the call. I think the sensitivity that we provided in previous 10-Q and 10-K filings are still appropriate. So for discount rates every 25 basis points change is worth about a $145 million change in our FAS expense, whereas for asset returns it takes a 400 basis points change to be about an $18 million change in our FAS expense. So, overall, if we were to set the market today, we would expect to have a positive adjustment to fast cash again if those results held. I would remind that between now and the end of the year we typically do sort of accrual settings that look at the current population of employees to see what has changed and that population as we do reductions in force, you know some of the dynamics of that accrual study do actually change in terms of the acquisition of the workforce that, upon which that liability is built upon.  One of the bigger changes that and it may not happen between now and the end of the year, but we're watching it closely as we are expecting a new sort of standard mortality rate to come out which I guess from a good news perspective, since all of us are going to live longer, sort of from the bad news perspective, it says your liabilities are likely going to be increasing per pension because people are living longer. So that will have a bit of a mitigating effect on what we just described there in the numbers that she said but again we’ll set that up. We’ll try to give you the same sort of preview, if you will, in the third quarter call that we do typically every single year. And that’s when I’ll give you probably a little more detail into that.  As far as cash contributions, we’ve actually already made in the third quarter the second tranche of the $750 million for a total of $1-1/2 billion pension contribution. So, that is done for the year and we’ll, you know, as usual, we always evaluate whether or not the need arises to do anymore towards the end of the year when we sort of see our cash from operations flung out on a four year basis. We’ll try and give you some insights into that, Miles, again when we talk again in the third quarter. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies: Thank you very much. I think this is kind of a two-part question, half for Bruce and half for Marillyn. If we look at the outlook for you, Bruce, and we kind of split the revenue forecast and look at what you’ve done for segment profit increase, it would appear as if margins are going to be down almost a couple of hundred basis points in the second half versus the first half. It looks like most of the increase in the outlook was attributable to the pick up. So maybe Marillyn, you might be able to address some of the productivity incentives underway that, you know, have enabled you first to do as well as you have in the first half and then maybe also address why it wouldn’t stay at the same rate, other than that one large contract adjustment. 
Bruce Tanner: Howard, let me try to address. You asked a pretty specific question there on segment operating margins in the second half and what’s expected to happen. So we did have a couple of things happen the first half of the year, including as you saw within our MST business, a couple of contractual resolutions. They were a good size. I mean obviously if you look at the margins for that business, in particular, that’s a record level of margins and it was obviously, maybe not obviously, but it was driven by those contractual resolutions. Those are not expected to replicate in the second half of the year. So that’s one item that will bring it down first half relative to second half.  Secondly, space systems also up a little bit first half of the year. Think of that as some of the phasing and the mix of where we're seeing some of the URLA equity earnings and expect to see a little bit of a reduction in that in the second half of the year. You know so that’s, I think you did the math exactly right in the guidance we have, Howard. You know the wild card in all this is we have a certain level of planned, I’ll say, risked retirements that we expect to occur in both third quarter and fourth quarter. And just as we had some benefits beyond what we were planning in the first and second quarter, if those occur as they did in the first and second, that may be able to mitigate some of that reduction you see or you're talking about. If they don’t, then we won't see that happen. It’s kind of that simple. Now I’ll put the call back over to Marillyn for I think the second half of your question. 
Marillyn Hewson: Your question about, you know, what do we see in terms of continued cost reductions, I would just, you know, point to the fact that we’ve had, we’ve been very corrective as I said earlier, the last several years, I’m just getting ahead of the budget cuts by reducing expenses and headcount. But we have very few leaders that don’t just manage programs, they manage their business on an ongoing basis. And they have very strong cost control discipline in their business. So we look at that and monitor that on an ongoing basis. As I said earlier, we tried to keep our structure in line with the business base we have. The other thing that is driving the performance of the businesses is just consistent performance on the programs. We don’t -- we're performing well across all of the business areas with very deliberate management of the programs in making sure that we perform and meet the cost targets that those contracts drive and continue to look at ways that we can improve our margins on the programs. It’s -- I think it’s a good -- straighter good performance by our leadership and our team across the business in executing on programs that they have.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: Good morning.
Marillyn Hewson: Good morning.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: I wanted to ask something, Bruce, just your discussion about the options just triggered something which is just in terms of the incentive compensation and thinking about things on going forward basis. I know that TSR is an important metric. But if a lot of people start cashing out of options, do you need to do something to continue to incent people on a go-forward basis. This is kind of part one. And part two, the higher stock price itself. What is that going to do for the remainder of the year in terms of the Rabbi Trusts or any other sorts of, I guess, compensation programs and the shares outstanding as a result?
Bruce Tanner: So Sam, I’ll address the first part. So if you have read the proxy, what you’ve seen happen in the past two years, we’ve actually been lowering the number of options that are paid not just to the senior leadership team but to leaders -- leadership in general. And in fact, at the start of this year, we eliminated option as a component of our executive compensation program. So all of our equity compensation going forward is either in the form of RSUs or performance stock units. And so one of the things that I don’t think we necessarily had a complete understanding amongst all of our investors is that some of the dilutive aspects that have been occurring -- that have been meeting to be offset through share repurchases had been because of the level of option exercises. So if you track the number of outstanding options over the past few years, that’s come down fairly significantly. And I guess, it’s kind of a good news, bad news each. As the stock price increases, we have more option exercise which increases the dilution effect but it also gets rid of those options at a faster cliff such that going forward. I don’t have this on top of my head but I want to say on an annual basis, we were currently providing somewhere in the 5-ish -- maybe 6 million shares or so of options on an annual basis, maybe more like 7 million shares. And if you’re just providing the same amount of executive compensation, it takes a lot fewer shares to do that with RSUs and performance stock units. So on an annual run rate, we’re going to see less dilutive opportunities, if you will, from our executive compensation program than we’ve had in years passed. So that’s a direct reflection of some of the conversations we’ve had with investors who raised that point to us and we made that change accordingly. I think your second question was the higher stock prices -- higher stock price in the second half of the year and its impact on the Rabbi Trust. And really there is not an associated impact there as I think of it, but certainly Rabbi Trust, you can put it in essentially the same sorts of options that 401-k opportunities are for employees. And we try to match that from our liabilities perspective. So I think it’s more targeted to overall market performance, if you will, then directly to the Lockheed Martin stock.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Following on aeronautics, if you look forward and you had about 12% margin levels recently. When you look forward, you are going through a fairly significant mix change with F-35 growing its share of revenues but at the same time, you’ve got more and more sustainment coming from F-22, F-16, C-130J, how do you see those two things playing out going forward and should we see aeronautics margins tend to stay at the kind of levels they’re at today?
Bruce Tanner:  Yeah. So I’ll try that one. We’ve said for quite some time, I always sort of describe this as the algebra of this business when it comes to aeronautics margins. Going forward, even though the overall F-35 margins are expected to increase going forward, we have a bit of mitigation impact there because we just lowered, if you will, the go forward booking rate, if you want to think about it that way from SSD contract by virtue of what we did with the adjustment we took this quarter.

Jerry F. Kircher:  I’m sorry. I think you’re coming up on, yeah maybe one last call? Someone has questions?
Bruce Tanner:  All right. 
Operator: And our final question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research:  Hi, good morning.
Marillyn Hewson:  Good morning.
George Shapiro - Shapiro Research:  Two quick ones probably for you Bruce; following up on that F-35; in the quarter you had commented you had a $50 million increase in profit and revenues were up $175 million. So could you break out how much of that was inception to date pickups versus just maybe, say the margin improvement itself? And then in the space area, you had a $50 million increase in the ULA profit which struck me as a big number. Did you just kind of just go through what caused that and is there any way to forecast what that might be going forward? Thanks.
Bruce Tanner:
--:
 :
 :
--: I think the thing that’s stuck out and the reason it stopped so much the second quarter of this year is because actually last year due to some of officer issues, the mix issues and the phase within the year, last year's second quarter was by far the lowest quarter of the year for ULA from an equity earning's perspective. So that made this quarter, although it is higher than to move, it has been historically, it made the difference between second quarter last year and second quarter this year appears even greater.
Marillyn Hewson: So let me wrap up our call today by again highlighting that I believe our second quarter results and increased guidance illustrate the solid position and performance of the corporation to provide value to our shareholders and solutions to our customers. Even in an uncertain budget environment, our product portfolio, strong balance sheet, robust cash generation and the exceptional execution by our 116,000 employees will continue to propel our corporation forward. So, thank you again for your interest and for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in October. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Jerry F. Kircher, III: Thank you, Aly, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to welcome you to our first quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

Marillyn A. Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I begin, I want to offer congratulations to our Lockheed Martin team for their outstanding performance that enabled the achievement of strong first quarter operational and financial results while operating in a dynamic and challenging environment. Their focus and efforts have our corporation poised for continued success in delivering solutions to customers and value to shareholders. While Bruce will cover the financials in more detail later on in the call, I would highlight some noteworthy financial performance in the quarter that included: Growth and earnings per share to $2.33, 15% above last year’s first quarter level; expansion of segment operating margin to 12.1%, achieving an increase of 20 basis points above last year’s level; and generation of $2.1 billion in cash from operation. Our continued strong cash flow is key to our cash deployment strategy to generate value to shareholders for share repurchases and dividend payments. In the first quarter, we repurchased over 5 million shares of stock for approximately $460 million and paid slightly under $400 million in dividends. These combined cash deployment actions returned over $830 million to shareholders in the quarter. We continue to execute our strategy through solid performance on our corporate business and by winning key competitors and follow-on awards to extend our franchise programs. We also expanded our international business activities and continued our measured pursuit and exploration into adjacent new businesses. Let me begin with a brief summary of our key order bookings in the quarter. Noteworthy awards included Aeronautics receipt of an IDIQ award on the F-22 program for a 10 year fleet modernization and extension under the Raptor enhanced development and integration program, with the potential value of almost $7 billion, and over eight long refunds for 29 new F-35 aircraft to the U.S. government. Additionally, we were awarded funds for long-lead acquisition of four F-35 aircraft for Japan. Mission Systems and Training received $700 million for two additional Littoral Combat Ships increasing our LCS work backlog to six vessels. And our Aegis team successful won a competitive award for the Combat Systems Engineering Agent program. This award extends our multi-decade legacy and leadership on this important missile defense system. Finally, our Space Systems team win a long-lead contract to begin construction of two additional spacecraft on the Cerberus Military Satellite Program for the U.S. Air Force. This award brings our backlog to four spacecraft and on this critical national program that provides worldwide Early Warning Detection of Ballistic Missile launches. These new awards and our backlog of future work are direct indicators of the closed alignment of our portfolio of products with customer strategic priorities and requirements and serve as a foundation for the future. Turning to operational performance, our five business areas continue to execute with exceptional focus and skill in providing critical services and products to customers. While the quarter contained numerous accomplishments, I’d like to highlight two notable successes and provide a brief update on F-35 key events. First as part of the national strategy to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region, our Littoral Combat Ship, The USS Freedom began its deployment to Southeast Asia. We are extremely proud to have our ship chosen to do the inaugural deployment of LCS class vessels to Southeast Asia. It is a testament to the maturity and capabilities of our innovative multi-mission ship and we look forward to her contributions to the seventh fleet. While visiting leaders have specific command this quarter, I had the opportunity to go on board freedom, while she was docked in Pearl Harbor en route to Southeast Asia. The pride of the crew and their ship and her capabilities was inspirational and only service to reinforce our critical role to provide these revolutionary warships to the navy. The next key operational achievement was accomplished by our Space Systems business with their successful launch of the second SBIRS satellite for the U.S. Air Force. I had the privilege to be at the launch site in Florida in March with our customer to watch the event. This satellite joins the currently deployed SBIRS spacecraft and expands the constellation of Early Warning Missile Detection satellite. In this era of increasing proliferation, a Ballistic Missile threats from rogue nations SBIRS provides vital intelligence and defense warning to our country and allies. We are honored to be providing these critical national assets to our country and look forward to delivering the remaining four satellites in our backlog. Moving to F-35, key accomplishments in the quarter were deployment of C-12 Aircraft to Nellis Air Force Base for operational testing and evaluation and completion of the first operational mission conduced by Air Force pilots. The first operational short take-off vertical landing at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, successful completion of the 3-Year Wing Flutter Testing Program on the C-12 version with clean results and the first night time vertical landing of Starbow aircraft at Patuxent River Naval Air Station. These accomplishments highlight the increasing maturity of the program. We are providing increasing levels of aircraft capability and performance to the multiple service branches to enable expansion of pilot training and operational evaluation of this revolutionary platform. I’d like to now turn to the status of DoD budgets. Since we last spoke in January, the President signed into law, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013. This act extended funding for the operations of all federal agencies through September 30, 2013. It included full-year appropriations for defense, military construction and veterans’ affairs. This continued resolution will fund all other government agencies at last year’s level. With the approved FY13 DoD appropriations of $527 billion, our key programs continue to be supported and funded under the full-year appropriation. Examples of that support we’re seeing with the appropriations increasing C-130J procurement to 16 aircraft from previously planned level of seven, and spending of almost $400 million for the continuation of the Meets program. However, funding appropriated through this act remains subject to the automatic budget cuts outlined under sequestration. We are encouraged by recent alternative budget proposals offered by various members of Congress to modify or eliminate the level of DoD budget reductions required under current sequestration. One version proposes no additional budget reductions to Defense budget levels, while another version proposes approximately $250 billion of reduction from Defense over the next 9 years. Adoption of either of these competing budget versions would represent a significant improvement over the current $500 billion in budget cuts required under sequestration. Beyond FY13 actions, the President submitted his fiscal year 2014 budget proposal earlier this month. The proposed level for the baseline FY14 defense budget was outlined at $526 billion, a level essentially equal to the current FY13 appropriations level. Initial insight into program priorities contained in the President’s FY14 request showed strong alignment in budget support for a number of our key programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Littoral Combat Ship, missile defense systems and higher quantities of C-130J aircraft. It should be noted that the FY14 proposed budget does not account for the implications of sequestration that went into effect in March 2013. The impact of sequestration on our business has been minimal to date and Bruce will provide some modeling sensitivity on our 2013 financial outlook of sequestration in FY13. Turning to the global security environment, rising tensions and threats on the Korean peninsula coupled with ongoing conflict and instability in the Middle East only reinforce the complexity of maintaining global security, a need for a spectrum of flexible and effective products to help maintain global security is growing more acute each day. Lockheed Martin products are foundational assets in the preservation of global security. Recent deployment of our products by the Department of Defense into the Southeast Asia region include placing F-22 fighters in South Korea and deploying the THAAD missile defense systems on Guam, The Littoral Combat Ship with the 7th fleet, and Aegis Missile Defense System. These deployments highlight the key strategic value and determine capabilities of our unparalleled products to national defense. Our portfolio remains in direct alignment with this global security mission and we look forward to providing critical defense and security solutions to domestic and international customers. I want to turn briefly to our focus and activity with the international customers this quarter. Expansion of international revenues remains a key component of our corporate strategy and we are on a path to grow international sales from approximately 17% of total revenues last year to at least 20% in the next few years. As we’ve outlined previously, key drivers of that expected growth will be higher levels of international work on the F-35 with growing levels of aircraft deliveries to our partner countries, plus C-130J aircraft, F-16 aircraft and missile defense solutions such as THAAD and Aegis. Direct and country interaction and listening to the needs of customers are essential components to successful international relationship building. This quarter, I had the opportunity to meet with key customers in Israel, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Italy. Discussion centered on how our corporation can help them with their diverse spectrum of security needs that range from fighter aircraft to missile defense systems to cyber security. While in Saudi Arabia we inaugurated our new in-country headquarters that will enable development of partnerships to create products and enhance our offerings in technology, aerospace and security sectors. A common theme of the meetings was we universally held believe that the global security environment is only becoming more complex and there is a wide spread desire to utilize many of our products and leading edge solutions to solve their most critical requirements. Before I ask Bruce to give you some color and details on our financial performance, I want to close my comments by providing some insight into three emerging technologies and adjacent pursuits of the corporation. As we have outlined in the past, one of the new technologies we are examining is in the sustainable and alternative energy generation field through a process called ocean thermal energy conversion or OTEC. This technology uses the temperature variations of ocean depth layers to power thermal exchange equipment and generate electricity. We have created unique intellectual property and expertise in thermal exchange and recently signed a memorandum of understanding to utilize our intellectual property and begin exploration of the design feasibility of a plant to generate electricity on a commercial scale. This agreement is expected to lead a contract that will fund our development efforts for 10-megawatt pilot plant anticipated to be located of the coast of Southern China. We were excited about the potential future prospects of this technology to generate, clean, renewable electricity. The second adjacent market I’ll give you an update on is our expanding commercial aircraft pilot training activities using simulators from our Sim-Industries business, that develops and manufactures full-motion and fixed-based civil aviation flight simulators for airline customers and independent pilot training centers worldwide. As a leader in commercial simulators for Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft, Sim recently extended this product line with simulators for the Airbus A330 and Boeing 767, Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 aircraft. Sim industries broad product offering enabled us to offer a very affordable training solution to the U.S. Air Force’s next generation KC-46 Tanker Program. These growing activities and opportunities in this area demonstrate the synergies that exist between the unique low-cost commercial offerings from Sim industries and their applications to future DoD programs. The air force is currently evaluating competitive bids for pilot training on the KC-46 Tanker with the decision on the winning bidder expected later this year. The third new business opportunity area I’ll highlight has recently emerged from our advanced material studies group and is in the area of water purification. We recently received a patent for Perforene material, which is a molecular filtration solution designed to provide clean potable water. The Perforene membrane features holes that are one nanometer or less in a graphing sheet and are small enough to trap sodium, chlorine and other ions from sea water while dramatically improving the flow through of water molecules. This flow through was 100 times better than current reverse osmosis systems, making it more effective at desalination at a fraction of the cost. Access to clean drinking water is becoming more critical as the global population continues to grow. We believe that this simple and affordable solution has a potential to be a game changer for the water industry. We are also investigating other applications for Perforene such as biopharmaceutical separations and removal of chemical substances and compounds from water used oil and gas wells. The pursuits I’ve highlighted today are only a few of innovative and expanding portfolio of intellectual property and products that offer future growth prospects for this corporation. We will keep you apprised of our progress in these areas. I’ll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our financial performance and then we’ll open up the line for questions. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let’s start with chart 3, an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $11.1 billion, down slightly from last year but ahead of our expectations at the beginning of this year. Segment operating margin was strong at 12.1%, a 20 basis point improvement over the first quarter last year. Our earnings per share were $2.33, up 15% from last year. We generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations and we repurchased 5.1 million shares in the quarter. So I think we are off to a good start in 2013. Chart 4 shows our sales for the first quarter this year versus last year. Aeronautic sales decreased by about 14% compared with last year. However, this was slightly better than our expectations when we spoke in January as we had higher aircraft deliveries than planned in the quarter. Our sales in the other four business areas were also stronger than expected particularly in Missiles and Fire Control, which also benefited from additional product deliveries and volume in the quarter. I should point out that with the implementation of sequestration delayed until March 1, we saw minimal impact for the quarter but would expect that impact to grow as we move forward. I’ll discuss sequestration in greater detail in subsequent charts. Moving to chart 5 in our first quarter segment operating results, our segment operating profit was comparable to last year’s level with the increase in margin offsetting the impact of lower sales in the quarter. We continue to have strong program execution and are taking appropriate cost reduction actions as needed. Turning to chart 6 on earnings per share, EPS in the quarter was 15% higher than a year-ago driven primarily by the lower pension expense as a result of our contributions at the end of last year and the benefits of the R&D tax credit. You remember that we mentioned on the last call that the first quarter would have the benefit of the full-year 2012 credit as well as the 2013 first quarter credit and that’s what we’re seeing here. On pension adjusted basis, our EPS grew to $2.56 in the quarter. On the chart 7, we’ll discuss our cash from operations in the quarter. As expected, our cash flow in the quarter was very strong at nearly $2.1 billion, more than $1.5 billion higher than the level last year. Although last year’s level was reduced by roughly $500 million pension contribution. We not only had strong operational performance, but also had the benefit of a $540 million tax refund in the quarter, resulting from our pension contributions at the end of last year. We expect that cash generated this quarter will be the highest for the year as we have both pension contributions and tax payments plan in future quarters that did not occur on the first quarter. On chart 8, we’ll discuss our cash returned to shareholders. We returned over $800 million to shareholders this quarter through our share repurchases and industry leading dividend yield. The level of share repurchases was almost doubled what we did in the first quarter last year and dividends were higher as a result of our 15% increase last September. Moving onto chart 9, we’ll discuss our updated view of the guidance, we provided on the last call. You recall that our January guidance did not consider the impacts of sequestration. Since then, sequestration did become effective on March 1, but as I said earlier, its implementation had minimal impact on our performance this quarter. Unless revised by Congress however we would expect to see the effect of sequestration having impact throughout the rest of this year. We try to model these potential impacts by assuming a peanut butter spread of expected reductions to our U.S. government business awarded with FY13 funds. Or said differently, we do not assume any flexibility on our customers’ part to favor one programs budget over another. Using that approach, we estimate a potential $825 million impact to our sales in 2013. With the strong results of each of our five business areas in the first quarter though, we believe our current sales outlook remains within the guidance range we’ve provided in January and I’ll explain that in more detail on the next chart. Chart 10 shows the methodology we use to develop our estimate of the impact of sequestration on our 2013 sales. At the mid point of our guidance, we would expect just over a three quarters of our sales or about $35 billion to be generated from our year end 2012 backlog and we would expect sales to non-U.S. government customers from orders received this year to be around $2 billion or so, neither of these amounts is expected to be directly impacted by sequestration, however our original estimate of $8.25 billion of U.S. government sales from new orders this year is expected to be impacted by sequestration. As we modeled the estimated impacts over the next three quarters, we project the reduction of around $825 million in sales primarily impacting IS&GS and MST. On chart 11, we provide our updated guidance. Assuming the modeling from the previous chart and factoring in our better than planned results in the first quarter, we now expect sales will be near the lower end of our guidance range. Even with the lower sales expectation, we are maintaining our side with operating profit and cash guidance reflecting our growing confidence on our performance for the rest of 2013 and we are maintaining our earnings per share guidance range of $8.80 to $9.10 that will emphasize that this range does not include restructuring charges if any associated with sequestration as they are unpredictable at this time. And finally, we have our summary on chart 12. The first quarter represents the strong start to the year with better than expected sales volume and strong segment operating profit and cash from operations. These results continued for a quite strong program execution, the proactive cost reduction measures we’re taking and the strength of our portfolio. And we continue to focus on actions and create value for our customers and our shareholders. With that, we’re ready for your questions, Aly?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan Securities LLC:  Thanks, good morning and good performance.
Bruce L. Tanner:  Hey, Joe.
Joseph Nadol – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Marillyn, I actually had a question for you on the extensive comments you gave on the non-defense portion of your business, which is small. But it seems like you’re targeting quite a bit for growth, and really just from two angles, one because as you know this has been a tough thing for defense companies to doing the path to diversify during a downturn. So the two questions are, one, in your approach to the market, how are you orient in the company to really to impact commercial markets, which is really a bit of difficult thing for companies to do? And I just mean the difference in the customer base relative to the government did some I guess comments there will be good. And then secondly from a risk standpoint, what kind of capital are you putting at risk and how are you considering that going forward? Thanks.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thanks for the question, Joe. This first half I would say the things that you are seeing coming forward are things that we’ve been investing in for a number of years. As a company we are a technology leader, we often talk about saying that we do hard stuff, we do difficult things and try to work on big things that are affecting the global environment, the global security environment. So we are always investing in the future in that regard. And we have 60,000 scientists and engineers that are working on things not only on our core products and services today, but also looking at ways to give our adversaries and advantage or look at new areas that we can help in global security needs. So even as our customer budgets decline, we’re going to continue to invest in these new technology so we think that’s really important that we do that. In terms of [ordering] as to commercial markets, I would say that the things that we’re doing right now are things that – as I said we’ve been investing in for sometime and while it is a different customer base they are large projects much like we do large projects across the corporation. And so to the risk, these are not big needle movers in the near term. We are not looking at a large cash investment we’ve been investing, for example, the Perforene and the nanotechnologies for the past seven years. We’ve been investing in the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion. We’ve been working on since the 70s. We increased our investment in past five years, but it’s measured and disciplined investment that we make in R&D just as we do across the business. So from that standpoint, it’s a matter of not putting any capital at risk, but that we do expect these to be fully funded. In fact, if you look at OTEC, that final plant will be fully funded by our partner as we bring our intellectual property forward in that arena. And in terms of the Perforene, we got a patent, but we are now looking for opportunities to partner and taking that one forward. So we partnered with companies in the commercial market that’s what gives us the capability to go into those new markets and that’s how we’ll approach them.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse:  Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner:  Good morning. 
Marillyn A. Hewson:  Good morning.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Marillyn and Bruce a very nice quarter; if I could just go back to the sequester discussion for a moment, I was going to ask Bruce if you could give us a little bit more color on why we don’t see more of an earnings or margin impact from the lower sales or is it simply that’s what embedded in the range. And then more specifically, Bruce on your modelling discussion you talked about peanut buttering the GFY-13 funding that impacts this year. But what percentage of GFY funding for Lockheed is beyond 2013. I would imagine with the long cycle nature of your product lines, it could be a large percentage?
Bruce L. Tanner:  Yeah. So let me try to address both those questions, Rob. So why profit and cash are not necessarily impacted or why we didn’t change the guidance for those two elements. First is we did do for sales. You know a lot of it is because of the first quarter quite honestly and obviously we were higher in the first quarter for sales as well but we had good results, pretty much across the board. All five business areas are planned for them in terms of both sales and operating profit. I think as we look forward for the next three quarters, we do expect to see some pressures for the reasons that I described from sequestration. As I said earlier that not played out at this point. But we do expect them to happen in the next three quarters. As we look out for the planned risk retirements and what we’ve accomplished in the first quarter, we think those are stronger as we said here today but maybe we thought that be at the start of this year and that’s the reason, we didn’t change the profit guidance. Cash flow, obviously, $2.1 billion in the first quarter, very strong, stronger than we had expected honestly and that’s the other reason why we think that’s going to carry after the rest of this year as well, that’s the reason we didn’t come down off of our cash as well. I think your second question was, so how much of the FY13 carries over in for next year? I made the comment, Rob that the sales we got from our backlog at the end of 2012 was about 77%. So think of that is new, see the FY, our calendar year 2013 sales originating 77% of which come from the 2012 backlog, that’s not an unusual pattern for us at all. I’ll say next year, we would expect it to look very similar to that. So you should think of that as probably 25-ish may be a little less than that percent of our sales in 2014, will need to come from orders received in 2014 and manifested into sales in 2014. So that pattern as I look back over time has been a fairly consistent one, not at all unusual for what we’re experiencing in 2013.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
Robert Stallard – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Rob.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
Robert Stallard – RBC Capital Markets: A quick question on capital deployment, do you expect that to be more consolidation in the defense industry as we see [the year] is playing out and would you see Lockheed being participating in that? And also to follow-on from your comments Marillyn about these adjacent markets, would you potentially be interested in acquisitions in line with more diversified areas, not just defense?
Marillyn A. Hewson: In terms of consolidations on the defense industry, I think you know as the spending contracts, we would expect that there would be more consolidation, it’s just at that level and it’s been communicated to us by our customers, I think that at the prime level, it’s about right in terms of the number of companies that are prime, so we’re probably get to second and third tier or below but we will see consolidation. But I certainly expect that because the economics will dictate that with the contraction of the budgets. In terms of acquisitions and to broadening our acquisitions, we’re going to stay into the near adjacencies. We prefer to do joint ventures and teaming where it makes sense and we’ll continue to look at our acquisition strategy as String of Pearls approach and look at what will line up with the capability that we need and the markets that we want to moved into.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Doug S. Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Doug.
Doug S. Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I’d like to understand how you’re thinking about the longer-term top-line outlook, because on one hand if I look at the backlog so to say played out in this quarter, it means, as I look at it, IS and GS appear to the most worried sum in that, obviously you could get it by sequestration. When you talk about contraction, it’s in the budget. It sounds like you are looking at a shrinkage overall in your top-line and if I pair that up against the new ventures you’re talking about going into, I mean I know that OTEC and the reverse osmosis purification program, this were going on 15 years ago. Are you looking at reading those forward more as a substitute for a contraction in the defense revenues? So, if something happen technologically that’s caused us to lead forward and become a more prominent effort.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thanks for the question, Doug. Just to address, where we see our growth, we do know that our core domestic defense business will flatten, potentially decline. So what we are focused on is growing our international business that is where we expect that to offset that and continue to grow. As I’ve said in previous calls and today as well we are currently at 17% of our sales. We expect to grow that to 20% over the next few years, but we will continue to focus on where that demand is from missile defense or [attack area] or immobility, a lot of our C4ISR satellite technology. It’s a whole range of products, but it continues to be a strong demand for internationally. In terms of these adjacencies and some that I talked about today, these are not needle movers in the near term. These are really those that we believe are long-term with large application potentially in these technologies and they are not new to the horizon for us. As I said, we have been working on them for a number of years. The fact that some of them have come to fruition, we are dealing with different partners and different customers and so they are once that have come about in the last few months that have come on the screen and we thought it would be appropriate to share with you what is happening in those, but our top line growth will be on our core and near adjacencies both domestically and internationally in the business.
Bruce L. Tanner:
 : We actually had a pilot plant in Hawaii, off the Coast of Hawaii, that’s been working as much, much smaller scale than the one we’re talking about, building going forward, we’ve had that operating for probably the last five years or so. So, some of the technologies has come together, some has just been ability to scale those technologies, particularly in the OTEC side of it. And so I think that’s what we’re seeing, it’s sort of the combination have been coincidentally they’re all sort of materializing here at the same time; frankly, very opportune time for us, because that’s where we are seeing some pressure with our largest domestic customer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.
Jason Gursky – Citi Investment Research: All right, good morning everyone.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner: Good morning.
Jason Gursky – Citi Investment Research: Just a clarification question and then a more medium one, on the adjacencies, can you talk about where you are from the percentage of revenue today and what your targets are? And then, is this a question of potentially selling these intellectual property rights, which you developed here? And then on the needy question Bruce can you talk a little bit about the cadence for cash for the rest of the year giving all the moving pieces with the pension contribution, the tax payments. And then, we also like think you have got the DoD moving from net pay of 15 days and 29 days, I’m just wondering if that’s going to have any impact on the cadence of the cash for the rest of the year?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yeah, Jason, good question. Let me try, I’ll answer both and see if Marillyn wants to add anything to what I would come up with. So on the adjacencies how big, you should think of this being fairly small, may be literally as below 5% of our overall sales right now, we’re hoping to grow that some going forward, the biggest elements we’ve got right now are in our energy business as well as our cyber security business, and those are two that we’ve talked about fairly consistently on the calls. You should think of those as again being tough, I’ll say low single digits percent of the overall sales in the corporation not into growth those going forward. The products that Marillyn described in her prepared remarks, will just add to that but not significantly I’ll say over the next five-year period of time. We are just really trying to convey the message that we like to think and we do difficult in all these projects that we are talking about have difficult in their middle name if nothing else, and we think we are riding our capabilities and the innovative capabilities of our workforce with products or with problems that need to be solved on a big scale and that’s what we are trying to see it for you. As far as the cadence for the cash, I’m glad you asked that and I hoping to work that at some point of conversation anyway, so obviously we are not going to do $2 billion a quarter when we are out looking $4 billion for the year. You should think we had no pension contributions and a tax refund in the first quarter of this year. We should be – over the next three quarters we should have pension payments in the second quarter and third quarter. We’ll actually had two tax payments just the way the calendar lines up in the second quarter and then the tax payments in the third quarter and fourth quarter. So what you should see especially in the second quarter is we will have cash flow down considerably, I mean probably to the point of on a free cash flow basis slightly better than positive we’re hoping but down its pretty significantly. And then I would expect it to grow up to the $800 million, $900 million in the last two quarters or so is what the expectation as we said here. You’ve asked about the payment cycle and so forth. And I’ll tell you, we’ve and I think the industry in large are seeing actually pretty good performance out of payment officers where we get the most the bulk of our collections from our customer. They’ve been paying typically quicker than sort of the statutory rates that have been paid in the past. What I am watching for going forward in particular, Jason is the effects of workforce furloughs on the part of the U.S. government and particularly is that affects our paying officers. And so you can imagine a scenario where people will be furlough, I think the current pick in the government is one day for 14 weeks in the months ahead. And the question is so, is everyone paying contractors sufficient in four days as they are in five, I got to believe that’s not going to be the case. I will say though that’s expected to be an impact in the fiscal year and not necessary for the calendar year, because obviously the fiscal year went in September and we would expect that the next calendar not to had those sorts of furloughs of leases we said here today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Safran of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Safran – Buckingham Research: Hi, good morning.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
Richard Safran – Buckingham Research: I wanted to ask you about book-to-bill. So if I did it right, looks like a book-to-bill of roughly 0.6. And I think that’s about what you did one quarter last year? So I thought maybe you could comment on expectations for book-to-bill this year and how you feel about full-year book-to-bill being either one times or higher?
Bruce L. Tanner:  Yeah, I’ll try that one Rich. So I think your math is right. It was a 0.6 book-to-bill. Actually as we look at the first quarter orders, we actually did better than we expected to do, pretty much across the board for orders for all our business areas. And in particular, I will say, I think that is one of the reasons why some of our short cycle businesses like IS & GS and sort of the services component of MST actually faired better in sales in the first quarter because we did actually receive slightly higher orders in the quarter than we’d expected to. Going forward, I think second quarter is going to be the lowest quarter from a backlog perspective of the year and then we would expect it to rise thereafter. So we expect second half orders to be higher than first half and the fourth quarter to be the highest quarter of all the quarters if you will. And that’s our typical pattern anyway. There is a couple of things I’ll point to that you might be watching out for in the second quarter. We have a few high dollar items, mostly within our large business areas. So we would expect to get at the second order for close, the second order for 18 aircraft for S-16 aircraft I should say for Iraq, probably get in order for couple of C-130s from Saudi Arabia. There is a possibility we’ll close on the Indian C-130 a second and C1-30 by for India for six aircraft. We still have six international aircraft and launch six for F-35 that yet to be sort of fully funded via under an undefinitized contractual action or UCA that we would hope would happen in the second quarter. We should get additional funding for even greater aircraft on LRIP-8, for F-35. And then switching to MST, we should be getting finalization of the MH-60 Denmark helicopter contract and some ground radar business within MST. So those are sort of the dollar awards that you want to watch the high dollar awards. Strategically, there is a couple of big items as well, almost all of them within MST in the second quarter. So the Air Missile Defense Radar AMDR program, we expect to be awarded in the second quarter as was space side, this is the sort of the Space Debris Tracking radar if you will from earth that we expect to happen in the second quarter. And then lastly within MST, the KC-46 Training activity that Marillyn mentioned in her prepared remarks is also something that we would expect to happen. Either late in the second quarter, early third, the rest of the year, we are hopeful obviously we got some missile defense products pack reason for a number of customers within the Middle East. And then recently if you saw some of the FMS activity just came out, we are hopeful to have some weapons on F-15s and some capabilities for helicopters in Saudi Arabia as well as the potential to sell additional F-16s to the UAE. So whether that one will happen between now and end of the year, it might be a little bit sporty but we’re focused on that and hopeful that that could occur. I should mention probably that we’ve also got activities within Singapore and South Korea for the F-35; again, not sure if those will happen this year or not, but they are on the custom, ones that we’re watching very closely.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: Yes. Good morning, Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, George.
George Shapiro – Shapiro Research: One little one and then one I’ll put together. You mentioned a contractual settlement on the F-16 in the quarter. Could you kind of ballpark, how big that was? And then a macro question is if you look at historically defense outlays and track them against military contractors very rarely does the military contractors vary a heck of a lot from the numbers, and if you look at 2014, the outlays for procurement in R&D probably going to be down at least 10%. So I guess I asked the question why won’t your revenues be down similar to what you would expect…
Bruce L. Tanner: Yeah, so George, I’ll take those. So F-16 the contractual resolution you should think of that being in and nothing sure to approach 10, but think of it in the 10ish million dollar range maybe little less than that. So not a particularly huge item, but one that’s been outstanding for quite a while and we’re delighted to have and finally settle now; I literally think this is one that is probably been around. As I have quite a few of these contractual resolutions, we have had settled in the past for probably close to a decade. So it is good to get them behind us. As far as the outlays, you’re looking at the defense outlays versus the contractor, you know what, I will remind you again that 61% of our sales roughly last year were from the DoD. So there is a full almost 40% that’s non-DoD, obviously the biggest component that is the international, we do expect as Marillyn said earlier to grow the international component of our business which would help to maybe explain why we don’t get down to 10% you are talking about there. And then what I would suggest George is that, even within that reduction in the procurement R&D, you have to look at the individual programs within the DoD budget because not every partner within the DoD budget is going down 10% and it ties into the priorities of the customer and our alignment of our portfolio with those priorities. So we would expect the F-35 to grow our air and missile defense programs to grow and help to offset that on the international side obviously as we mentioned earlier, the air and missile defense components especially growing over the next few years. It helps to offset that reduction. I think you’re seeing in the – and sort of the high level map that you described.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Company, Inc.:  Thank you. I want to ask more of an operational question and for example if we look at aeronautics, Marillyn, you were able to hold the decline, for example on the C-130 to about $10 million, despite seeing a $175 million decline in revenues, which is pretty impressive sort of action. And, if we look across some of the other businesses despite, difficult revenue numbers, the margins were pretty darn good. Could you talk a little bit about with some detail on some of the things you’re doing whether it’s head count or for space and you know, because no matter what happens with the sequester. I think there is just going to be a real utmost pressure on the business for a while?
Marillyn A. Hewson:  Howard, we’re definitely focused on operational performance, so I think you characterize it well in terms of talking about it being operational because we’ve been, we not only are we driving improvement even if we reduce the rate on the C-130J, we are able to hold our position relative to profit on the program. So, I think you’re seeing the results of that and at the same time, we’re very much across our business, working on reducing cost and increasing efficiencies and productivity in the business; so a lot of activities, not just operationally with our particular program but all of that flows through to all of our programs. So the things that we’re doing in getting out of facilities and reducing our overheads and the efficiencies that come with, just having a razor focus on cost across every element of the business is helping us to bring in better performance. And then within the C-130J, I mean as it moves through its courses you have a learning curve and so continuing to have productivity improvements as we continue with the rate of that program.
Bruce L. Tanner: Howard, just a interesting little [titbits] there. And my aeronautics friends have pointed this off to me as we’ve done reviews with Marillyn and the leadership team there. We’ve actually for the past few C-130 since we’ve started building at 24 aircraft a year, the hourly rate or the hours it takes to assemble that C-130 is we’re actually performing better than we were – when we were delivering 34 aircrafts a year. So that’s no small feat when you are on number what 4500 aircraft, not 4500, 2500 aircraft through the line, and at this stage of the product development or product manufacturing cycle that we’ve been able to make that those are real live reductions and it’s one of several instances that we can point to there, we’re taking the right actions particularly on a manufacturing side of bringing down the product cost in line with the shrinking volume that we’re seeing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank Securities: Thanks, good morning. First one is a classification, Bruce I think you had previously talked about $8 billion in backlog and in the year and can’t recall that was with sequestration without and if that number had changed?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, so Myles, I think what I have tried to key up is that we always expect that we take a downturn in the first quarter, probably get further down a second quarter, I think at the start of the year, I said we hope to get back around the $80 billion mark that still obviously a goal that we have, but I think it’s going to be tougher assuming that the next three quarters are hit by sequestration. So those numbers, you remember them right, it was $80 billion. But I’ll say that’s probably a tougher – as we said here today because that did not compare the effects of sequestration. And of course we would think that orders in the fiscal year since we had more of our orders obviously coming from that fiscal year 2013 funds would be more significantly impacted them with sales in calendar year 2013, because less of those come from fiscal year 2013 fund. So it would be a bigger number than the $825 million of sales impact is what I would expect from an orders perspective. But we’re not yet at this point giving up on that and hopefully as quarter’s go by, I also have a better idea what that looks like and we’ll be able to update that for you as we go through the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Yes, thank you and great performance.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thank you.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company: Bruce, one of the things you highlighted was that EACs were better than expected. It was 470, 35% of sales, that’s substantially higher than it’s been in any of the last couple of years. Where do you expect it to be for the year? And two questions, give us some color on the quarterly pattern as you did with the cash flow? And then where notionally can this number go in the future as it likely to come down than more normal levels or is it still sustainable? Thanks so much.
Bruce L. Tanner:  (inaudible). So EACs at least as I look at Cai, we actually we’re a little bit lower in terms of profit adjustments in the first quarter of this year as compared to what we did last year. So think of it, still in the sort of mid 30-ish range, but slightly less I think about $15 million bucks or $20 million bucks less this year versus last year. U.S. for sort of the pattern going forward, we would expect to be within probably the 30% to 35% range each and every quarter going forward probably down a little bit from last year overall, but of course the sales and the segment profit are expected to be down this year compared to last year, so that’s probably following suite for the lower volumes that you see there. Nothing really jumps out as I look at it as far as spikiness as we sit here today in terms of the pattern going forward, that obviously changes as we do risk retirements, we do them when we retire the risk not when we necessarily plan to do the risk. So when I describe the pattern going forward, it’s when we plan to do but we can obviously do better or worse than that. We really don’t have a reason to believe to the future necessarily going to look any differently in the past. I know that’s been the subject of a lot of riding but it is the same methodology we’ve used consistently for a long, long time and that has been our pattern. We’ve got to describe that over time, I think last year was the best odd in a couple of quarters because we had some large contractual resolutions that sort of jumped up that were are not in our historical levels. But going forward what we see is still sort of in that 30% to 35% range and not much change for that, Cai von.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company:  And then you mentioned that it was better than you expected, how much has that changed? You mentioned that was a plus for the full year to offset the lower sales. Is that how much better does it look now approximately?
Bruce L. Tanner: I don’t know I have got the numbers at the top of my head, Cai. But I would say we were not expecting. We got the benefit of both volume obviously. I mean I think on the last call I teed up that we are probably going to be down a billion dollars year-over-year in the first quarter. We ended up being down what about $800 million. We again across the board, all five business areas were better in sales, better in profit. The sales obviously brought volume in terms of profit on those sales. If I had to get some number out, probably offset maybe about 50-ish plus million dollars is probably what I would guess that happened earlier and somewhat higher than we had expected kind and that’s a little bit off the top of my head and we’ll see what that looks like going forward. But again I don’t see a huge pattern shipped as we go forward in the next three quarters from what we did in the first quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS. Please go ahead.
David Strauss – UBS: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, David.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Good morning.
David Strauss – UBS: Bruce, going through your sequestration map as it relates to 2014, is there anything besides international that would offset overall revenues potentially being down in the high single digit range? And then Marillyn, a question for you in terms of sizing the business for sequestration, you obviously highlighted here further restructuring of IS&GS. Can you just talk about maybe broadly how you view the business size wise, from a head count perspective if sequestration does go through in full effect? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes. So David, you asked me the first part of that question. So again what I try to key up and I won’t just simply repeat myself but we do tend to have a very similar pattern as far as the amount of sales that we derived from backlog year-over-year. So as we’ve talked in the past, our long cycle businesses, Aeronautics and Space in particular get 90% plus of their in the following year from the backlog from prior years, that goes down. Probably IS and GS is our lowest business that gets in terms of the percentage of sales that are derived from previous years backlog. I think about, that’s probably 65-ish percent or so, 35% comes from new orders turning into new sales in the year. The thing about 2014 that I think we all have to remember is, 2013 is the peanut butter or across the board cuts. 2014 with the new President’s budget, there is no peanut butter cut, so they can actually cut whatever – I’ll say aligned with the strategy starting in government fiscal year 2014, that’s different then what we saw or what we will see in fiscal year 2013 and where I would offer up, this is sort of the proof of the putting or whether or not your portfolio aligns to the government’s strategic interest or not in terms of the DoD’s priorities. We think ours does – we think ours has more staying power in that environment than in a peanut butter environment, and that’s what I think, David I think is maybe all that will understood that I think it does make a difference as we look into FY14 versus FY13.
David Strauss – UBS:  Hi, Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson:  So, you address the sizing of the business for sequestration. Now we’re going to size the businesses as we get more clarity from our customer. Frankly it’s difficult to forecast, I know Bruce talked a lot about modeling, but it really was – the best we could do to model what that impact would be until we get better insight on their planning for sequestration will be difficult to say which programs get hit and therefore which program what kind of head count might be modified accordingly. So, there is a lot of uncertainty here. As Bruce said though, we look at the budget request for FY2014, it does certainly support not only the national security strategy but it also very much aligns with our portfolio. We’ll continue to invest in new technology, we’ll continue to drive down our cost and I think we remain well positioned to succeed in this environment going forward.
David Strauss – UBS:  Aly, if I could, maybe one last question please.
Operator:  Our final question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo Securities:  Thank you. I said I want to go one in. Hey Bruce, can you discuss a little bit about the sales, before you had said sales for the quarter would be about a $1 billion below and then you came in a little bit better on aircraft deliveries but it looks like almost across the board, MST and MFC, IS & GS space all running ahead of what you said you would be doing in the 10-K in terms of the full-year. So is there a reason why there was so much front ended and what is that mean for the progression of the different quarters?
Bruce L. Tanner:  Yes, good question, Sam. So I try to tee that up, I think what Cai von asked the earlier question that they maybe more higher in the first quarter as expected. I teed up being about a $1 billion down, we actually have been $200 million down, so there is $800 million of goodness there. I think if it is a couple hundred million within Aeronautics probably for a couple of C-130s earlier delivered than planned. The rest of those volumes, Missile & Fire Control was up on just a percentage basis like 13% year-over-year in the first quarter. Most of that was the facing or timing of deliveries of products there. So think of it is in particular tactical missiles JASSM, missiles the Multiple Launch Rocket System activities there. That’s earlier than planned but not necessarily upper for the year as we look at this at the end of the first quarter.
 : So not sure if that was last throughout the year, that’s one of the reasons we put the guidance out that we did, but we’re pleased to have that in fact in the first quarter, I think some of that is because we frankly saw, I’ll say a sense of urgency to get things under contract prior to the end of last year when we thought sequestration was going to start in early January, I think we experienced a similar phenomenon at the end of February when the customer thought that sequestration was going to get in effect on March 1, a number of customers thought that obligated funds would that be subject to sequestration if obligated prior to that. I think we got bit of a rush to kind of get those under contract, I think we’re seeing the benefits of that on our short cycle businesses. So maybe just to finish off my long dialogue here, but going forward the next few quarters, I think our sales levels are going to be similar in the second quarter and third quarter to what we experienced in the first quarter maybe down slightly, because sequestrations largest impacts at least as we look for the rest of the year going to occur in the second quarter and third quarters, because you’re kind of squeezing the full government’s fiscal year with sequestration cuts into the last two quarters of the fiscal year. So for us that the second quarter and third quarter of the calendar year, I think we’ll see bigger reductions there, I do think fourth quarter will be the largest quarter of the year going forward even with the potential reductions that have yet to be announced in fiscal year 2014 from sequestration. So that’s sort of how I think of the – again the next three quarters similar, may be a little bit down, because the sequestration to the first quarter and then a pop up in the fourth quarter.

I would remind you that statements made in today’s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today’s press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause the actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And I hope you’ve all had a good start to the New Year. Before I begin, I want to say that it’s a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call and I look forward to working with you going forward. I hope you got a chance to review our press release outlining fourth quarter and full-year results. I am extraordinarily pleased and proud of our Lockheed Martin team. We have continued to achieve strong program execution and focus in a challenging environment. These efforts enable the corporation to achieve exceptional operational and financial results in 2012. Let me begin with a brief summary of 2012. Strong order bookings in the fourth quarter resulted in our achieving a record annual level of almost $49 billion in new business awards from domestic and international customers. Noteworthy awards included $4.4 billion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program for additional production activities, $2 billion for two additional spacecraft on the Advanced EHF Military Communications program for the Air Force and $800 million for additional Patriot-3 missile defense components for the U.S. government and Taiwan. These new orders enabled us to finish 2012 with a record backlog of over $82 billion. Our backlog of work provides a solid foundation for the future and is a direct indicator of the close alignment of our portfolio products with customers’ strategic priorities and requirements, even in today’s demanding fiscal climate. Other record performance levels for the corporation included growing our earnings per share from continuing operations to $8.36, the highest EPS level we have ever achieved increasing our segment operating profit to almost $5.6 billion, $300 million above the 2011 level. Expanding our segment operating margin to a record 11.8%, an increase of 40 basis points above the 2011 level, and growing our sales to over $47 billion, despite a challenging budget environment. These achievements reflect our commitment to affordability as our team drives for increased efficiencies and improved execution for our customers. We also continue to implement our cash deployment strategy to generate value to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we paid $373 million in dividend and repurchased $286 million in shares. These actions brought our full-year total for cash return to shareholders to $2.4 billion reflecting dividend payments of $1.4 billion and share repurchases of $1 billion. In addition to the cash returns in 2012, we generated 20% total shareholder return achieved by stock-price appreciation and dividend yield. These results reflect the quality of our work force, the strength of the corporation and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and shareholders. Thanks to everyone in the company for their contributions in driving the strong achievements. In addition to these results, we also continued our strategic acquisitions under our String of Pearls strategy, with the purchase of two businesses in the quarter. Both of these acquisitions expand our offerings in support of our customers increased emphasis on advanced unmanned systems and are consistent with our goal to maintain a portfolio of technology advanced options that will generate value for customers and shareholders. The first acquisition was for Chandler/May, a company that specializes in the design, manufacturing and support of unmanned aerial systems. The second acquisition was for CDL Systems, a software engineering firm that specializes in the development and licensing of vehicle control software for unmanned systems. These purchases following our acquisition early in 2012 of Procerus Technologies, and will be part of our mission systems and training business, where they will be integrated into our growing portfolio of unmanned systems and technologies. Turning now to operational performance, our five business areas continue to execute with exceptional skill and focus in providing critical products and services to customers. While the quarter contain numerous accomplishments across the enterprise, I’d like to highlight two unprecedented successes in the ballistic missile defense test arena. First, four of our five business areas provided equipment and support in the first ever integrated ballistic missile defense test of the Aegis, Patriot and THAAD systems. These systems work together to successfully detect, track and destroy multiple ballistic missile and cruise missile targets in a live fire test. This operational test was conducted by soldiers, sailors and airmen from multiple combatant commands and demonstrated the maturity and reliability of these essential missile defense systems. It also demonstrated the benefits of layered, interoperable missile defense solutions that can provide protection to the U.S. and allies against the increasing proliferation of ballistic missiles. With the proven reliability and capabilities of our Aegis, Patriot and THAAD systems, we look forward to growing domestic and international customer demand for missile defense systems. The second significant ballistic missile defense event was achieved by our Medium Extended Air Defense or MEAD, successfully tracking and intercepting a target in its first ever intercept flight test. MEADs is a next-generation air and missile defense system that incorporates full parameter 360° defense and provide eight times the coverage area of current legacy systems, while dramatically reducing operational and support cost. With this intercept demonstrating the maturity, next-generation capabilities and cost effectiveness of MEAD, we urge Congress to provide future funding for the program. Moving to F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, our aeronautics team continued their momentum in this quarter through significant advances on the development program and achieving an increasing tempo on production programs. On the development program, key achievements included accomplishment of test flights for the year that were 18% ahead of goal, and accomplishment of test points for the year that were 10% ahead of the goal. The aircraft also surpassed 5000 flight hours and achieved the first aerial weapons release for CTOL and STOVL aircraft and maximum high angle of attack fight on CTOL aircraft. In addition to the test flight success, I had the pleasure to attend the official delivery ceremony of the first operational STOVL aircraft to Marine Corp Air Station in Yuma, Arizona in November. The ceremony marked the handover of the jets to the service and with the receipt of these aircraft, the base will start tactical operational training on this critical asset for the Marine Crop. Also in the area of training, the 33rd fighter wing at Eglin Air Force Base completed the requirements allowing their wing to begin pilot training in 2013. These events in Arizona and Florida demonstrate the increasing tempo and maturity of the training programs, as we work to get these assets to the services. Turning to production activities, we continue to make progress on our production tempo with delivery of 13 aircraft in the fourth quarter. This brought our full year deliveries to 30 aircraft more than double the aircraft deliveries achieved in 2011. Significant contractual progress was also achieved this quarter, with completion and negotiations on the LRIP 5 contract, awarded an undefinitized contract action LRIP 6 and long-lead for LRIP 7. These contracts provides significant stability to the program, as we work with our partners to provide these critical aircraft to domestic, and international customers. These latest contract awards bring our F-35 production backlog at year-end to 88 aircraft. Our maturing production lines, operational base stand up and expanded pilot training are all strong indicators of the F-35 programs positive trajectory. Beyond the operational program accomplishments we continue to take additional actions to drive affordability across the corporations, and to increase customer alignment. Along with the perviously announced reorganization of our electronics systems business area and to two new business areas, Missiles and Fire Control's and Mission Systems & Training, effective December 31, 2012. We also announced consolidation of several corporate functions at our headquarters designed to streamline and tighten the corporate staff. These actions will improve collaboration and coordination across the enterprise, increase efficiency and achieve greater synergy. It will also focus us on the actions that best position the company for success and growth in a demanding and dynamic environment. I would like to turn now to the status of DoD budgets, and the continuing levels of uncertainty for fiscal year ‘13 and beyond funding levels. Currently the DoD is operating under a continuing resolution through at least March 27, for FY 2013 with funding constraint to prior FY 2012 levels. This limitation will cause funds to run short in some accounts and we’ll continue last year’s dated priorities that don’t necessarily reflect the new defense strategy, because of this, and other limitations associated with the full-year CR, we are strongly urging Congress to pass the defense appropriations bill in March and not extend the CR for the remainder of the year. The second area, budget uncertainty is associated with the pending threat of sequestration or automatic budget cut. Since our October call, some encouraging action was undertaken by Congress and the White House to avoid implementation of these across the board budget reductions. In early January, the President timed the generation, the deferred implementation of approximately $1.2 trillion in automatic federal budget reductions for two months until March 1. However, if sequestration is allowed to happen on March 1, it’s still result in cuts of $0.5 trillion each in defense and non-defense accounts over nine years. For defense, that’s an additional $0.5 trillion in cuts beyond the $487 billion already imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, while we recognized the both parties are strongly imposed to allowing sequestration to happen. We remain deeply concerned that sequestration could occur as the default outcome, if negotiations failed to produce an agreement. As the Joint Chiefs of Staff just explained in a powerful January 14 letter, sequestration is not only puts a risk our defense industrial base, it also forms military readiness, and would quickly hollow out our military forces. In the weeks ahead, we’ll continue to work with our government leaders to encourage a more effective solution to our nation’s fiscal challenges. Despite the continuing uncertainty on U.S. defense budget, it is absolutely clear that there is a growing need for security solutions in a challenging global landscape. Events this past quarter, such as the successful North Korean multistage missile launch, coupled with the continued rise in China’s military strength, ongoing instability in the Middle East, and the expansion of terrorist activity in Africa, only highlight the complexity and volatility embedded in the mission of maintaining global security. Our portfolio of products and capabilities remain in direct alignment with this global security mission, and we look forward to help in domestic and international customers, secure solutions to their most critical defense and security requirements. While no one can precisely predict the impacts of sequestration, where events that will unfold in the global security environment, there is one thing I know for certain, every one of our 120,000 employees stands ready to take on, whatever challenges emerge. Focusing internally, I want to reiterate the priorities that I have reinforced with the team since assuming my new role as CEO. These priorities are consistent and unchanged from those that I helped to formulate as the member of the Executive Office, and working with Bob Stevens in my prior role. I thought it useful to outline those priorities on the call today. My direction to our team is to grow the business with key drivers being fighter fleet recapitalization from the F-35, missile defense in Aegis, THAAD and Patriot, cargo aircraft fleet expansion with C-5M and C-130J, littoral combat ships, fleet expansion and C4ISR, achieve higher levels of program performance, and execution excellence to satisfy customer requirements, and provide financial returns to shareholders, pursue a strategy to secure and expand our core business, and expand and to closely align adjacent markets such as cyber security, grow international revenues to at least 20% of total corporate assets in the next few years. Continue to return at least 50% of annual free cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Invest for growth, through renovation, product evolution, and strategic acquisitions under our String of Pearls strategy. Finally, and importantly, continue our strong focus on talent development and employee engagement. I believe achievement of these priorities will enable our corporation to continue to provide superior performance to our customers and shareholders as we move forward. Before I ask Bruce to give you some color and detail on our performance, I want to highlight two organizational changes approved by our Board yesterday. First, Joanne Maguire, Executive Vice President of our Space Systems business advised of her plan to retire from our company after a distinguished career. Since taking over the leadership role in Space Systems in 2006, she has grown the business, while streamlining the cost structure for our customers and expanding returns to shareholders. Under her leadership and drive for innovation, Space Systems achieved a remarkable track record of mission success and continues to provide broader array of advanced technology systems for national security, civil and commercial customers. Effective April 1, Rick Ambrose will assume responsibility as Executive Vice President of our Space Systems business replacing Joanne. Rick brings over 33 years of experience in the aerospace and defense industry, and has currently been serving as Vice President and Deputy for Space Systems reporting to Joanne. Rick's vivid background within System Systems, leading our intelligence business in IS&GS, and his leadership roles in our former Mission Systems and Sensors business will be extremely valuable experience, as we move the space business forward for our customers and employees. Secondly, Linda Gooden, Executive Vice President of Information Systems & Global Solutions has also advised of her plan to retire after more than 32 years with corporation. Linda assumed the leadership role at IS&GS in 2007, and has managed over 30,000 professionals, who provide integrated, information technology solutions, systems and support for worldwide missions to civil, defense, intelligence, and other government customers. Her customer knowledge and leadership have been key catalyst enabling IS&GS to maintain its leading position as the largest IT provider to the U.S. government for the past 18 years. Effective April 1, Sondra Barbour will assume responsibility as Executive Vice President of IS&GS replacing Linda. Sondra is currently serving as our Senior Vice President, Enterprise Business Services and Chief Information Officer, for the Corporation. As CIO, Sondra is responsible for leading our internal IT operations including the protection of ours and our customers infrastructure and information from cyber threats. She was also instrumental in defining and launching our new government and commercial cyber security business. Sondra’s knowledge of IT systems coupled with 20 years experience in IS&GS, where she served in program management and as CIO and Vice President of Operations, demonstrated her strong leadership and track record that have prepared her well for her new role to lead IS&GS. Both Joanne and Linda have had exceptional carriers and are exceptional executives in every respect through their dedication and professionalism; I really want to thank them for their leadership and service to corporation over their carriers, these retirements and their succession by proven leaders highlight, why we’ve invested so much energy and time in our talent management and leadership development programs. Our succession planning process is vitally important to the future of the corporation and provides the outstanding cadre of highly qualified executives ready to assume additional responsibility, and take our business forward. Both Rick and Sondra represent the depth and breadth of talent in our company and bring proven leadership track records. Each has decades of experience gained by working in diversified assignments. They are leaders who have built superb teams in prior assignments, and I look forward to their ongoing contributions as they assume their new role. I will now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our performance, and then we’ll open up the line for questions. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks Marillyn and good afternoon everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today. Let’s start with chart three; an overview of the year. We grew sales for the year to $47.2 billion, exceeding the guidance that we provided in October. I’ll discuss sales in greater detail in the next few charts. We increased our segment operating margins to 11.8% or 40 basis points higher than our 2011 margin. Our earnings per share were $8.36; we generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations after making $3.6 billion of pension contributions. I’ll explain the reasons for the additional contribution amount in subsequent charts. And our backlog finished very strong, at over $82 billion. We had said throughout 2012 that we expect the backlog to end the year at about the same level as we began, but this obviously exceeded our expectations. Chart four, shows our sales trend for the past four years, $47.2 billion represents the highest level of sales in our history, and I’m pleased that we’ve been able to grow about 8%, since 2009 a period with significant economic and budgetary pressures. Moving to chart five, and looking at our new alignment of five business areas, three of our five business areas grew sales during the year including MST, aeronautics, and space while missiles and fire control sales were comparable to 2011. As expected, IS&GS showed a reduction in sales versus 2011, reflecting both the overall decline in the federal IT budget, and the effects of the continuing resolution in the fourth quarter. Turning to chart six, in segment operating results, we grew consolidated segment operating profit by over $300 million, with one quarter of the growth due to the higher sales volume mentioned previously. The remaining increase results from the 40 basis point margin improvement to 11.8%, reflecting the strong performance and proactive cost measures taken during the year. So turn to chart seven, you see each of the business areas margins in 2012 compared with 2011. Three of our five business areas improve margins in the year including aeronautics, MST and missiles and fire control. And space was comparable with the prior year reflecting the breadth of our execution and cost improvement actions. On chart eight, we will discuss the earnings per share for the year. We grew EPS by more than 6% over the 2011 amount, and this represents the first time, we’ve exceeded the $8 per share level. Our pension adjusted EPS grew to just below $10 per share. On chart nine, we will reconcile our actual 2012 EPS versus our last guidance range. In October we gave our EPS guidance as $8.20 to $8.40 resulting in a midpoint of $8.30 per share. Our fourth quarter results yielded $150 million more in segment operating profits than was contemplated in the EPS midpoint resulting in a $0.31 improvement. We had other items that reduced EPS by $0.25 including a non-operational tax item worth $0.18 and special item in the quarter related to headcount reductions in our aeronautics business that was worth $0.05. Overall the fourth quarter changes netted to the $0.06 increase over our October mid point guidance. The non-operational tax item was due to our $2.5 billion discretionary pension contribution in the fourth quarter which caused our taxable income to be lower than the level planned in the first three quarters of the year. This required a true up in the fourth quarter reducing the manufacturing deduction for the year and lowering EPS by $0.18. Future year’s taxable income will be higher as a result of the accelerated pension contributions end of 2012 and we expect to capture most of the reduced manufacturing deduction over the next two years. We’ve [weighed] [ph] the contributions for several reasons. First, with the possibility of Corporate Tax Reform, this contribution locks in our pension deduction at the current statutory rate of 35% and should the rate be reduced to 25% as has been discussed, this benefit will be worth $250 million. Second, earlier contributions to our pension plans allow the assets to grow quicker also lowering future required contributions. Next we have the cash on hand to make the contributions which otherwise would yield minimal interest income and finally the acceleration into 2012 increases operating cash in the future providing a fairly quick payback and a very low interest-rate environment. Chart 10, shows our operating cash results prior to the discretionary pension contribution. Our guidance in October was that our cash from operations will be greater than or equal to $4 billion prior to the pension contribution, our cash from operations was $4.1 billion, slightly higher than expected. On chart 11, we’ll discuss our backlog trends for the past few years. We’ve grown our backlog since 2009 by $5 billion more than our sales growth over the same time frame. And the $82.3 billion at year end 2012 represents our highest ever backlog level. As you can see our book-to-bill ratio has exceeded 1.0 in each of the last three years. Chart 12, provides the assumption embedded in our 2013 guidance, importantly our guidance for the year assumes a continuum resolution through the current date of March 27 and it does not assume the sequestration reductions are implemented. Our fast cash pension adjustment of $485 million is based on a 4% discount rate, and long-term asset return of 8%, consistent with our assumptions in October. And our planned contribution level in 2013, is $1.5 billion equal to the level of cash recovery in the year. The expected earnings from the $2.5 billion pension contribution reduces our 2013 FAS expense by $200 million at the assumed 8% return levels. 2013, will include both the 2012 and 2013 benefit of the R&D tax credit legislation passed earlier this year. As a result of that legislation being passed in January, the 2012 benefit will be recognized entirely in the first quarter, as well one quarter of the 2013 credits. We expect this benefit to amount to $45 million in the quarter, and approximately $75 million for the year. Finally our share count remains flat, with share repurchases offsetting the effects of option exercises and new issuances. Chart 13, provides our new outlook for 2013, our sales for the year are consistent with our expectations when we last spoke in October, despite the significant increase in fourth quarter 2012 sales. Segment operating profit and the resulting margin are both higher than we indicated in October with the expectation that our strong performance in 2012 will carry over into 2013. EPS from continuing operations are expected to be between $8.80 and $9.10 for the year and cash from operations are expected to be greater than or equal to $4 billion. As prevailing in the year, we would expect sequential growth in our sales during the year with the first quarter being markedly lower than the next three quarters and about $1 million lower than the first quarter of 2012 due primarily to lower aircraft qualities in our aeronautics business. In the first quarter, we expect to have 10 fewer F-16s, six fewer C-130s, low C-5 deliveries and lower F-22 volume as there were production deliveries in the first quarter last year, and there are none this year. Margins are expected to be fairly consistent back order in the mid 11% range that could obviously change depending on the timing of risk retirements. Cash would be strong in the first quarter with a benefit of the large tax refund as a result of the discretionary pension contribution and backlog will likely drop in the first quarter and first half of the year as orders are expected to be more heavily loaded in the second half of the year. Chart 14, shows the guidance ranges for sales and segment operating profit by our business areas. Note that the reorganization of our former electronic systems business results in two nearly equally sized business areas in Missiles and Fire Control and Mission Systems and Training. And finally, we wrap up with our summary on Chart 15. 2012 was a strong year for us both operationally and financially. These results reflect the strong performance and proactive steps, we’ve been taking for several years and our challenges to continue that success into the future. Our backlog is positioned just well and speaks to the alignment of our portfolio with the needs of our customers, and require the 20% total return we provided our shareholders in 2012 and we stand ready to perform in 2013. With that we are ready for your questions. Karen?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Good afternoon everyone.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Jason.
Jason M. Gursky – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Yeah, welcome Marillyn. Bruce, I wanted to target this question to you and talk a little bit about cash deployment. I think this big pension contribution that we made here during the quarter may have caught a few of us by surprise. And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about whether you contemplated kind of letting us know that this was going to be coming perhaps why you didn't? And then also maybe just talk a little bit about long-term capital deployment and what you see on the horizon with regard to the mix, we just now had a big pension contribution, does that take that off the table now for a number of years and we get a much more steady stream of operating cash flow that can be used to deploy either back into the business or back into shareholders through repurchases and dividends.
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks Jason. I think you got your money worth on that question. So let's see where do I start, as to why we did it at the end of the year and why we didn't tell you, and did we contemplate telling you. We did a fairly comprehensive study as far as pension analyses are concerned relative to our funding requirements, the expectations in the future, the sensitivity of our plans through asset returns, discount rate changes and the like. You may or may not be aware, we actually sent out in the fourth quarter an offering to our terminated but vested participants in the plan offering to essentially give them lump sum payments in lieu of the pension payments over periods of time when they retired. We got a fairly good return on that, actually reducing some of the volatility and our liability associated with those individuals going forward. We were studying this issue right up until literally the end of the fourth quarter, Jason. And we were studying at the same time the prospects of what was going on in Washington relative to corporate tax reform and we were speaking to the Board at that time saying we think this might be sort of the confluence of a lot of different actions that should result in us potentially making a larger contribution for the pension plan in 2012 in order to, in my words lock-in the deduction at 35%. We do feel there’s a strong possibility for corporate tax reform going forward. We think that number could be anywhere from a 25% to 28% rate as opposed to the current 35% and we very much wanted to, as I said earlier lock in that rate. I walked through the very dynamics that I said in the prepared remarks relative to we thinking that this is a very quick payback, and the interest that we’re earning on the cash on the balance sheet is probably about 20 basis points as we sit here today. So if the acceleration occurs and within a low interest rate period of time and we’re getting low interest on the cash that sits on the balance sheet, currently, it did accelerate the tax deduction as we talked about earlier and I liked the fact that it also reduces the gap between pension adjusted and reported earnings, as I mentioned earlier as well. Now, we look at this Jason, and now this, I'll give you some stats here. So taking a look at 2013, one of the reasons we did it, the $2.5 billion as we looked at how much cash did we want to have left on the balance sheet and how much flexibility did we want to have going into 2013 to enable us to do the sorts of cash deployment activities we’ve done in years past. So in 2013, we're looking at $4 billion of operating cash. We're looking at roughly $1 billion or so of capital expenditure. So $3 billion of free cash flow. We do have about $150 million debt retirement that we were going to do in 2013. So think of that as contributing $850 million sort of unencumbered, of our free cash flow and we felt that that $850 million plus the $1.9 billion on the balance sheet so almost $2.8 billion was very adequate to continue to do the kind of cash deployment that we have done in the past. I think a fair question would be, so you guys have said, you’re not going to have a share count increase, what's that level of share repurchase that you’re counting on there and at least for our planning purposes we're expecting about $700 million of share repurchase activity in order to affect that and that's our estimate of how many options will be exercised in a year and also how many new issuances of stock will occur for executive compensation matching of our retirement plans in the like. So collectively, we think from a cash deployment -between the current dividend contributions that we'll have in 2013 or roughly $1.5 billion plus the $700 million of share repurchase embedded in our guidance, that’s $2.2 billion. As I said, I think we still have adequate flexibility on the balance sheet, and unencumbered cash flow to remain opportunistic to do additional share repurchases or mergers and our acquisition candidates, if in fact they looked fine for us to make those acquisitions. I think the other side of it is, we don’t see this as a change and I think Marillyn made those comments in her prepared remarks relative to our long standing cash deployment practice of contributing at least 50% of more of free cash flow to our shareholders and that is still our intent, and I think I said it earlier, but I’ll close again, the reason for the timing was we literally didn’t have this discussion until late in December with our Board of Directors before making this contribution. So kind of long winded answer, Jason, sorry about that?
Operator:  Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran – Buckingham Research:  Hi, good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Rich.
Richard Safran – Buckingham Research:  I have a question of IS&GS, you’re guiding to 9% margins for the year, given the margin pressure in this environment right now, can you discuss a little bit about what gives you the ability and confidence you can sustain 9% margins and also maybe if you could comment if this is being driven by you cyber and intelligence business.
Bruce L. Tanner:  Hey, thanks Richard. I’ll take that one as well. So if we look at IS&GS, I think we made a very conscious decision and I discussed this on previous calls, we try to differentiate ourselves somewhat in this market, by focusing on what I’ll call mission IT, where we’re literally sort of providing the embedded capabilities in large measure for our customers as opposed to what I’ll call commodity IT, and you think about that as sort of back shop processing and the like, helpdesks, those sort of things, where we really didn't see, we have done that work in the past, but really we didn't see sort of a discriminator or differentiator for Lockheed Martin in doing that work. So we focused much more on the mission part of the IT service that tends to be a higher margin part of the service activity in the IT world. So that's one thing that gives me the confidence that we continue to do that.  And as I look back Rich, over the last probably eight or nine quarters, IS&GS has been nine or the low 9% return on sales consecutively for those eight or nine quarters. So that gives me confidence again going into 2013, and we continue to do that. You asked about the cyber, we are very excited about the cyber activity within IS&GS. We've had some very successful wins including taking some business away from some of our competitors within cyber. I believe we are the largest federal cyber provider in the industry. And that work is very valued, that's very much in line with that mission IT that I talked about, and that work as you would suspect supports that 9% margin as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Doug S. Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC:  Good afternoon. 
Bruce L. Tanner:  Hi Doug. 
Doug S. Harned – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC:  I’d like to follow-on Jason's question about cash deployment. If I look at the last few years, particularly 2010 and 2011, and if you look at, what I will call the cash yield to shareholders the net repurchase of shares, plus the dividends you've been above 10%. And I think a lot of people found that very attractive. Today when you’re looking forward for this year, we’re basically at 5%, if you assume no net share repurchases, and about 5% dividend yield. When you look out to 2014, 2015, how do you think about that, do you think about it in terms of, what yield the shareholders would be, is this a temporary period, we are handling a pension issue. And then you may go up to, I would call larger yields to shareholders in the future. How do you look at this?
Bruce L. Tanner: Doug, I’ll try that one as well, I’ll speak for myself, and I think I speak for the Board. We don’t go about selecting share repurchase amounts from what additive to our dividend levels would get us to a certain level of return on our shares or a certain level of return on our market cap if you will. And that is just not the way we think about that. We very much look at this as opportunistic. we’ve increased obviously the share, the dividend amounts considerably over the past few years to where that in and of itself essentially takes care of the 50% or more of free cash flow without any contribution of share repurchases. I think if you look at where our pension plan is sitting from a funding perspective. To me, it’s fairly obvious that you’d want to help that pension plan get a higher level of funding, that’s definitely a near-term use of cash than maybe it was a few years ago, with the rates going down. I’ll tell you that was very much part of the study that I mentioned on discussion with Jason as to, what is the appropriate amount to contribute to the pension versus the real life possibility that interest rates increase, and actually get us into an over-funded situation, but we are certainly not abandoning our share repurchase strategy, we want to remain optimistic, that’s the reason I try to give the color on the fact that we have lots of flexibility, not just this year, but you asked about 2014 and 2015, with growing cash, as I expect to happen over the next two years, I think we’ll have even greater flexibility in ’14, and ’15 than we do in 2013.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee.
Peter J. Arment – Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.:  Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon, Marillyn. Question Bruce, I guess on the backlog, what’s been impressive over the last few years, with the defense pressure has been the, your ability to kind of grow the backlog. Can you talk a little bit about, how the backup looks for ’13, and what you need to see in terms of bookings in the second half of this year for international activity, to kind of hold these levels, just given what we’re going to see with sequestration kicking in? Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner:  Yes, let me give you sort of maybe a wide all-encompassing orders and backlog response to the question, Peter. So expectation wise, if I take a look at where we expect the orders for the year to end, and where we are right now from a backlog perspective, I think we’ll end the year close to the $80 billion level, we might not be able to replicate the $82 billion that’s the highest level we ever have done, but I feel pretty good about being able to get to the $80 billion or so. This will be an interesting year; you’ve seen some of the correspondences come out of the acquisition community relative to delaying some of the near term awards associated with continuing resolution and anticipation of sequestration. So we are definitely expecting to have a significantly more loaded second half of the year than in the first half. So, I would expect each of the first two quarters to be below a 1.0 book to bill, I’d expect the next two to be above 1.0 book-to-bill. I’ll say we have a significant amount of international activity that we’re counting on the year. I’ll just rattle off a few of the orders that I think are important both from a dollar perspective and maybe a strategic perspective. And I’ll ask Marillyn maybe to comment on some of the strategic ones as well. But we got sort of near-term – think of these as first half, I hate to give quarters only because of some of the delays that have occurred. But first half, we got the two LCS ships for the FY13 order. We got closure for the lot six international aircraft for five aircraft. We’re hoping and our customer is hoping to definitize the lot 6 and lot 7 for F-35 negotiations in the first half of the year. I think an important one that I think is worth mentioning is we expect to get long lead funding for lot 8 of the F-35 program for some 48 aircrafts. Just the quantity alone versus the prior year’s quantity is worth mentioning. Think of that as 29 domestic aircrafts and 19 international aircraft including 9 FMS, for military sales, outside of the eight initial partners on the country (inaudible), excuse me. Strategically there is some things to watch that aren’t necessarily big dollar events, but they are strategically important to us. So the Aegis Combat System’s engineering contract, within our MST operations, think of this as next generation Aegis development for the capabilities there. The KC-46 training and the interesting thing about that is we’re actually - the only reason we’re able to bid that frankly is because of the acquisition of the Sim-Industries last year, that gives us some capabilities to do that training capability on the 767 aircraft is the basis of the KC-46. We have the Air and Missile Defense Radar which is sort of the next generation air and missile defense as the name implies, radar for surface combatants. Second half of the year we have a couple of vehicles 5 and 6 for the SBIRS contract, some THAAD UAE follow on production Lot 5 contract for the THAAD order, and some orders they tend to get on the common annual basis, the Fleet Ballistic Missile and next order the RERP, somewhere that mix internationally, we’ve got the C-130 to Saudi as well. We’ve got an Iraqi F-16 order, for another batch of 18 aircraft, we’re hopeful for, and scattered throughout that are other smaller international business, I should point out that in the year 2012, we did about 17% sales, and about 17% of orders on international basis, and that’s roughly what we’re expecting in 2013, maybe little bit higher that the orders as far as the total content of our orders in 2013.
Marillyn A. Hewson:  So let me just add to that, we do have a strong focus on international growth in our growth portfolio, and as Bruce has listed out several items, but certainly there’s continued strong demand for Air and Missile defense in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, and so we expect to continue to see a pull for PAC-3, THAAD, Aegis and in addition to that air mobility, F-16 as Bruce, he listed off, several of those things that are out there, that we’re looking at, but we expect to grow our portfolio in the international side to at least 20% of our revenue in the next few years.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton, from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton – Deutsche Bank Securities: Thanks, good morning – sorry good afternoon by now, first one is a clarification, Bruce is the $1.5 million in 2013, discretionary or required, I would be surprised if required give me a brief on that?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yeah. That’s our plan levels. Myles, I think the required amount is less than that.
Myles A. Walton – Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. And you mentioned the lot 8 quantities 19 international; I guess nine of those being able to mess Japan or Israel or combination of the two. And then 10 partners from a partner perspective, it’s obviously good growth overall, but it seems like the partners are certainly flipping out to the right versus where they would have been 12 months ago in lot 8. Is there upward mobility to the lot 8 or is that kind of what the international partners will look like, I guess about 12 months ago, I would have thought, maybe that number would have been 30, now it sounds like it’s 10, and what does that bode for the next couple halves thereafter?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yeah. I’m trying to think of the 30 Myles. I can’t imagine the scenario that would have gotten us to 30 aircraft. I think perhaps the number that you were thinking that might have been a little bit higher was, the Turkish aircraft in lot 8. They are now pushed out to the right. I think if we actually go back a couple of years, you would have seen fewer Israelian, Japanese aircraft, and so it’s actually helped to mitigate some of those Turkish aircraft at least in lot 8, but that’s you asked about the flexibility, I wouldn’t think we would see the orders bouncing around much if any from that level, customers I will say yes, we have ongoing conversations with our customers, and they continue to like at the F-35 as we continue to perform. And I think that’s the more we can do and demonstrate the capabilities of the aircraft and show that capability to customers like South Korea for instance, the more of this aircraft will stay on the future.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Then I think as I talked about earlier in my remarks we've made great progress on the program, it's maturing and the development process as well as the production ramping up. We've got 5,000 hours on the aircraft. We are committed to delivering an affordable aircraft and we are on plan, actually we're being ahead of plan to 2010 baseline that was put in place.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JP Morgan.
Joseph B. Nadol III – JP Morgan Securities:  Thanks good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Joe.
Joseph B. Nadol III – JP Morgan Securities: This has been a very smooth transition thus far in terms of leadership Marillyn. But when I look at the either 2011 annual report in front of me, and there are nine folks in the picture. One of them is in his current seat and that is the person next to you, Bruce, everyone else has changed. So my question is in that context you have a very smooth transition, all the plants are the same, but the combination of these people here must have very different ideas in how to do things including you. So I am wondering if you could list a top two or three, may be that on top of your head in terms of how we think about the company, what might change?
Marillyn A. Hewson:  Well, we are all connected. This is a very tight team, this leadership team and that is why our succession plan has been so smooth and successful. We have been operating to the same strategy for a number of years and the results demonstrate the strategy is working. We have very experienced team of folks and so even though ones that are moving into the new roles have been with Corporation for a number of years. They are all experienced executives, and we spent a lot of time working together on making sure everyone does understand our strategy. So we in fact in another week will have the entire leadership team from across the Corporation together to talk about our strategy for the coming year to build on that, so we don’t work together for a long time, and we’re not in the mood of changing the strategy that we have, but our Board of Directors are directly involved in talent development and the succession training process. In fact, as Joanne and Linda announced their intent to retire, we took that to the Board, we reflected back on our pipeline of talent with them, and there was not even a hesitation on who would move into the next role. So we’ve been calling together with tight leadership team for a number of years and it’s a well planned transition process, and I don’t expect there to be changes. We’ll work together and deal with the environment they’re operating in and adapt to it.
Operator: Thank you. and our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel – Jefferies & Co., Inc.:  Thank you very much. I just want to follow-up a little bit on sort of change in the environment that you see going forward, and how you want to take advantage of that, Marillyn. In one case, you have Congress doing things like ring-fencing on EADS and in other cases; you have what I call low-cost competitors trying to unseat a very reliable solution in ULA. how do you deal with those two competitive threats?
Marillyn A. Hewson:  Any competitive threats we’ve taken to account the environment that we’re operating in, I think we have a very strong portfolio, and even me, I think is demonstrating success, the flight test that we had in November and the flight test we have planned through this year, later this year. We’re going to operate to our technologies and our innovation that we bring to the marketplace is the hallmark of this corporation. and we are very much proactively focused on cost efficiencies and that’s a critical discriminator for Israel. So this competition that we are dealing with it’s really not new to us at all. We are used to it. It's constant. That's how we operate all the time. It is in a competitive environment and we will continue to do so. So I don't find that has something that is a big change for us. We understand our competition, we understand the market that we are operating in and we're going to excel in these markets.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro – Shapiro research: Good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, George.
George Shapiro – Shapiro research: I'd like you to go through a little bit more detail some of the moving parts in aeronautics, something like one of the things that's in the release, that the operating profit is about comparable to ‘11 for the F-35 and the F-22. So the F-22 is down considerably from last year. F-35 is probably grown. So can you discuss kind of how much growth we saw in the F-35, where you are? If we change they made a booking rate and the margins et cetera.
Bruce L. Tanner: George, are you talking 2012 or are you talking to 2013?
George Shapiro – Shapiro research: I was just reading from the release in terms of your analysis that the operating profit for the December quarter, there is a comment in there that operating profit was comparable to the same period in ’11 for F-35 contracts and the F-22, and sales were comparable as well which says that the I would imply the F-35 profit must have gone up, because you were booking lower on the F-35 than you were on the F-22, we know the F-22 revenues are way down. Looking for some more clarity.
Bruce L. Tanner: I think in the press release, I don't have it in front of me George. But I think what they are saying is that F-35 sales and F-35 profit this quarter are comparable to that F-35 sales and F-35 profit levels last year whereas F-22 sales and profit are comparable to last year’s quarter as well, not that the two of them are comparable to each other if you follow.
Bruce L. Tanner: (Inaudible) we’re coming on the hour, but because we have a number of people from the queue are sort of extended the comments today. We’d like to go ahead and extend the call at least another 15 minutes to 4:15 or so to let people ask questions.
Operator: Certainly, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. 
Carter Copeland – Barclays Capital: Hi, good afternoon and welcome, Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thank you.
Carter Copeland – Barclays Capital: Just wanted to ask quickly about the F-35, the commentary from your customer last quarter before you sent the contract was that you were pretty fall apart on terms, yet you closed that negotiation before the end of the year and I wondered if you might comment on how you reached a conclusion there and what the implications are for the follow-on negotiations from your prospective, as Bruce highlighted that there’s several up to follow-on lot negotiations that are sitting in front of you this year. any color would be much appreciated?
Marillyn A. Hewson: Sure. Carter, well, basically on the F-35, there were five negotiations what was important was for both sides to understand the cost structure of their positions. and so we had an opportunity to spend time with our customer, and let them share with us how they viewed all of the cost elements, we had an opportunity to likewise share that with them. and I think through that process we were able to come to a mutual understanding, and get to a closer negotiation and we reached a fair and yet challenging agreement. and so it wasn’t – I think it did take a little longer, because we had a lot of time that we had to go through to, from both sides to really assess it, but it was nothing around the terms and conditions that drove that, it was really around the costs. So I think we’re in a good posture for lot 6 and 7, we already have the undefinitized contract action, and they’re under contract, and we are in direct discussions right now at the program level on the lot 6 and 7 and the intend is to negotiate both of them together and get that done in the first half of the year, and our customers really need us going forward and make sure that we meet the challenges, but they put in front of us and that we’re taking cost out. So in addition to getting our prime negotiated and getting on with our 6 and 7, we are working very hard on taking costs out of our business and driving toward a more affordable product for them in all aspects of our business.
Operator: Thank you. and our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert M. Spingarn – Credit Suisse: Yes, good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, Rob.
Robert M. Spingarn – Credit Suisse: A question for Bruce and this is building on George’s question on the aeronautics, but I would like to take you up on the 2013 part of that, and may I ask if you could refresh us on the manifest by program, your quantities, the margin you see for the major programs, and in particular, if you could talk, just update us on the F-35 on the 36 aircraft, how we just think about, which lots those are from and profitability on F-35 in ‘13 relative to ‘12?
Bruce L. Tanner: Rob, you asked the question to me. so I’ll answer it. So as we look at 2013, I think I said in the October call, we’re going to be down probably 10, C-130 aircraft, so think of that – we did, I believe 34 in 2012 and other 24 or so in 2013. The F-16s, 37 last year, about 13 this year, think of that has really no change in aircraft deliveries from the four more flying. All the change we’re talking about there was the aircraft that were delivered on to Turkish lines, so you will see sort of cost fluctuations, associated with that with the aircraft coming off the line in full order. C-5 we’ve talked, we really talked in the October call about the increased volume there. So we ended up delivering four, we actually delivered maybe an extra that we work exactly counting on delivering in 2012, but we ended up with four for the year. We’re expecting somewhere around eight, so kind of a doubling of quantities on the C-5 program next year. And you talked about the F-35 deliveries, we’re looking at probably a 20% increase. We did 30 this year, we’re looking at 36 next year. (Inaudible) aircraft, those were I believe I will make it just a little bit off, I believe those were the tail-end. We started delivering lot 4, aircraft at the end of 2012. We’ll deliver all remaining lot 4 aircraft in 2013, and then we’ll start, and I’ve lost track exactly. We’re out somewhere in the middle of the year, third quarter-ish time of the year, we’ll start delivering lot 5 aircraft, and those will be the aircraft that we deliver all the way through the end of the year. Margins, on the F-35 program. We are expecting to go up in 2013. Therefore no other reason than the absence of the profit adjustment we took, I believe in the second quarter on the SCD contract to lower the expectations on the award fee going forward. But we’re also, because we did have success, I’ll remind you we started 2012 for the goal of delivering 30 aircraft, we had multiple strike at our four more facility, and we still delivered 30 aircraft, and so as you’d like to imagine that says the efficiencies we are getting in the production line are starting to be self evident. And with those efficiencies, we would expect in 2013 to actually have some profit step ups on the production contracts, so we would expect the overall rate between the combined SCD contract and the LRIPs in 2013 to be higher than it were in 2012.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Company:  Thank you, very much. I may have missed it, but what did you say about the orders for the full year 2013, and could you give us a little split between if there is no sequestration I assume that to your assumption, and if there is sequestration, which part of our business, which of your orders, put it that way, 2013, do you see as a greatest risk?
Bruce L. Tanner: So 2013, the orders I was talking about, where we I think what I said is, we expect to have orders given our sales level that would essentially get us back to about $80 billion backlog, so you can kind of solve for the math, I will think of it as, I don’t know somewhere $40 billion, $45 billion or so, and as far as, we are not assuming the effects of sequestration, as I said in my prepared remarks, and how that would manifest itself in terms of the impact in the orders, it always described IS&GS as a very short cycle business, if you look at the numbers for IS&GS right now, we are expecting a downturn in 2013 over 2012, and to large extent, that’s because the federal IT budget has gone down, frankly with or without sequestration, I think a fair question is how much more can you take out as the federal IT budget even under sequestration environment you still accomplish a test that you need from an IT perspective. We don’t have a lot of, we look at, there has probably a shift over the past two years to have more of these IDIQ task orders. So I’d suspect and a lot of those where they are occurring is in the IS&GS business, so I would expect during the sequestration we would see less extra sizing of those IDIQ task orders. I said earlier – in response to another question, I lost track who asked it, that I think we’re seeing some of the sort of the push out orders right now in part, because of Secretary Carter’s, guidance relative to preparation under the continuing resolution, and I would argue one of the prospects of sequestration, they are pushing out some of the larger orders I believe, anything over $0.5 billion as to go to him for approval or it’s authorized. so I’m not knowing exactly how sequestration will be manifested in terms of what I’d like to call the peanut spread versus a targeted spread, it’s hard for me to say how those order could be impacted, whether they’d be pushed to the right or reduced, and at this point, I’d frankly be speculating at this point, other than to say IS&GS will likely get hit the largest percent would be my guess the longer cycle businesses would be get less approval than IS&GS.
Marillyn A. Hewson: All right. I will just add to that on the sequestration front, I mean that’s why we have been so vocal about what a terrible policy that is to have sequestration come into play, some are very encouraged that we’re trying to – that our government Congress is trying to get to a permanent elimination of those across the board cut, because if fact if they have, if they’re going to take any cuts and they can do it along the lines of the national security strategy and do it in the areas that align better with what our administration and our entire defense is trying to accomplish that’s the best outcome. And for us, as we look at it, I mean, I think we have a great portfolio that’s aligned with those strategic priorities of the US government and our defense department. So if we get through sequestration, and it doesn’t happen and it allows our defense department to decide where they take cuts, we think we’re actually very well-positioned. 
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes the line of David Strauss, from UBS.
David E. Strauss – UBS Securities LLC: Good afternoon.
Bruce L. Tanner: Hi, David.
David E. Strauss – UBS Securities LLC: Marillyn a question for you, you guys have gone after you cost structure very aggressively just like you tell both from a square footage prospective and head count. Despite the fact that the budget hasn’t come down much yet and your top line is held up pretty well. How much more room do you have to address headcount and square footage industrial cost structure and it’s entirety, maybe disproportioning what happens to the budget from here.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Well I tell. we’re a large corporation, and we have, I think we still have more opportunity particularly on the foot print side. As we laid out a plan to take cost out, we put it in more aggressively about 3 years ago and so we’ve been about this pro active approach to taking out cost in our infrastructure and our processes for a number of years. As you mentioned we have had some reductions in for us we’ve taken our some management layers, we’ve been collapsing some organizations, in order to get some cost out in that regard. And on the foot print side, we’ve taken out about $1.9 million square feet for the last couple of years and we’re going to take another $2.9 million between now and the end of 2014. So there is more to go there, I believe there is also opportunities for us. Just to continue on an ongoing basis to drive cost out, and so that we can meet the demand of our custom members. We’ve been getting out of these space for example, we’ll continue to look at even providing more affordable products to our customers taking weighed out at how we can reduce cycle time, all of those things that would give them a more affordable product as well. So we’ll continue to do that, that is something we set targets on every year, drive cost out of our business, and we want to continue to do that, remain competitive and win more business.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Sam Pearlstein – Wells Fargo:  Good afternoon, Bruce I was wondering if you could walk a little bit through the cash in 2013 just as you get from cash flow from operations about $1.6 billion to over $4 billion. We know pension is certainly less of a headwind, but what else is improving taxes, interest advances working capital. What else for the drivers there?
Bruce L. Tanner: Let me see if I can do that on top off my head, Sam so $4 billion as you said in 2013 versus the $1.6 billion, level the biggest driver obviously is the $2.5 billion pension contribution, $3.6 million I guess I should say, versus the $1.5 million by 2013. We’re actually expecting a slight increase in our working capital and something I’ll speak from myself, personally that I have targeted to try to minimize that amount of working capital growth. I think some of that might be a little bit of planning conservatism. We tend to plan, even say, our several international orders maybe a little bit lighter relative to payment terms than we actually are able to negotiate that ends up manifesting itself in the form of higher working capital than maybe what we actually experience that what I’ll be watching. Income taxes, I am trying to think what we’re planning on income taxes. See, we’re actually down, I believe, I think we’re down probably like – we’re actually further paying out relative to tax that is fairly close from booking within our earnings it’s down probably about $150-ish million just. So it is sort of a cash flow up down. You see the $150 million from an earnings perspective going down the cash. As far as the biggest drivers that I am looking at next year, a little bit of change in depreciation, amortization, about enough to talk about, so really just sort of the working capital and a slight change in the taxes there.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. 
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs & Company: Hi, good afternoon, Bruce and Jerry, and welcome to the earnings call process, Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thank you.
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs & Company: Marillyn, I wanted to ask you the sort of a follow up to the question on cost cutting, but a little bit bigger picture and long-term. One of the big concerns we still hear from investors on defense companies, is with regard to the sustainability of margins and whether or not there is a shoot or drop there. And in historical cycles, you’ve seen margins come down pretty significantly, Lockheed Martin has been able to kind of hum along at this 11.5% segment operating margin right through everything we’ve seen thus far. How do you think about where margins go and how sustainable they are? Is there risk in your view that the part of the backlog was more favorable in terms of trade, sunsets and more difficult backlog layers in, just curious how you think about that given your many experiences operating the business? And then, one quick for Bruce. Have you done the math on the 2014 FAS/CAS number with the hypothetical that nothing changes in ‘14 versus ’13.
Marillyn A. Hewson: Thanks for the question. I’ll just kick-off with the margins. As you look at our portfolio, we have a lot of mature products that we have to move down the production lines and those that are moved into production and we’re in position where we can drive higher margins through the process of booking higher profit rates on those programs moving forward. And then as I said, we’re growing our international sales component and through that process, because of the risk return relationship there on the international sales and we expect to get higher margins on that. While the portfolio is transitioning, if you think about where F-35 is, we are still on development, but concurrent to that we’re moving into production and with that production over time and with the volume that we’re going to bring along in a fixed price incentive environment and then fixed price environment, that’s going to allow us to improve our margins. LCS, with our LCS program, moving along as it ramps up with additional ships coming online, that will allow us to improve margins and a lot of our missile programs are well long in production. So there’s fewer development programs in place, three to five elements coming along strongly. And then it’s typically and internationally as I said, we see our margins. We think Bruce, do you want to take the other part of this question?
Bruce L. Tanner:
 :
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs & Company: And I think maybe one more.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Bill Loomis from Stifel Nicolaus. 
Bill R. Loomis – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks for taking the question. Bruce, just when you talked about the first quarter being $1 billion lower. I just want to be clear that that was versus the year ago. And then you talked about the lower deliveries in aeronautics, but obviously with that grouping 3.7 billion in the first quarter ‘12 that would be a pretty significant percentage drop. So it is the bulk of that can be there and if now, which is the other groups and why do you see that coming back if it is coming from the other groups as well.
Bruce L. Tanner: So, Bill you heard rightly. The billion dollars I was talking about was comparing first quarter 2013 versus first quarter of 2012. I gave in my prepared remarks, the aircraft quality changes. So very, very significant within aeronautics and the reason we feel good about it coming back the other way is because those aircraft are higher on a comparative basis to the previous quarter in the next three quarters. The other – just as I look at the data releases, I said here today. Part of the way, I would look at sales going forward. Again, I mentioned earlier, it’s sequential growth quarter-over-quarter. So think of the – it’s obviously lower I believe every single quarter versus 2012, but it gets lower than 2012 by a smaller percent with each successive quarter. Said differently, fourth quarter 2013 is not nearly as far off of fourth quarters of 2012 on the first three quarters of 2013 versus the first three quarters of 2012. And the other thing I looked at is the innovative software, but as more I just say, but the second half of the year from a revenue perspective is about $1 billion for that six months greater than the first half of the year. So we’re definitely the level of back-end loaded in large part because of the aircraft qualities we heave there, but yes something of the other shifts within the business areas as well forcing in the second half.
Marillyn A. Hewson: So, I want to just wrap up here and tell you all thank you for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to speaking to you in April. Thanks. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry F. Kircher: Thank you, Ally, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kubasik, our Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert J. Stevens: Thanks, Jerry, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. We know most of you are having a really busy day, and we appreciate you being with us. I want to begin with a brief summary of the third quarter, which I see as a continuation of the strong momentum and focus on execution we've been achieving throughout this year. In the third quarter, segment operating margin increased to 12.1%, a solid improvement over the prior year level of 11.2%. Cash generation was strong at $1.6 billion, and earnings per share from continuing operations expanded by 11%. Our financial strength enabled a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.15 a share or $4.60 annually. This is the 10th consecutive year that we've raised the dividend by a double-digit percentage increase. We continue to implement our cash deployment strategy and returned over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases. Strong year-to-date performance and execution also enabled us to increase our 2012 full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. These results reflect the strength of our corporation and the focus we all have on delivering value to customers and shareholders. Thanks to everyone in the company for their many contributions in driving these strong results. Turning to the external environment and budget status. Congress passed the continuing resolution to fund government fiscal year 2013 activities for 6 months through March 27, 2013. Under this continuing resolution, our key programs continue to be supported and funded at levels consistent with prior fiscal year appropriations. Beyond the continuing resolution that's in place, the possibility of sequestration continues to be of great concern to us. As currently written, this law that requires approximately $55 billion in reductions to defense accounts and a like amount to non-defense discretionary accounts will take effect on January 2. We have petitioned Congress and the administration to stop sequestration and replace it with a more constructive process, a position we continue to support. In parallel, we've also been asking the government for additional planning information so we can responsibly and properly prepare to act. On September 28, the Department of Defense provided additional planning guidance, indicating that no contract actions associated with sequestration would occur on January 2, the date sequestration is to be effective, and that no contract action would likely occur for several months beyond January 2. On that same day, the Office of Management and Budget assured that any of our employees who would potentially be affected by a reduction in force necessitated by sequestration would be eligible for full coverage under the provisions of the WARN Act and that our company would be able to recover associated costs. With this new information, we adjusted the timing of our actions as it would have been improper for us to issue WARN notices in October or November when the timing of any potential sequestration-related events would likely not occur for at least 6 months or more. Some reporting about our decision to move the timing of the release of WARN notices has been inaccurate, concluding that we either no longer intend to issue WARN notices if a sequestration-driven reduction in force is necessary or that employees potentially affected by reduction in force would not have the full coverage of the WARN Act, or that our actions may have been taken to achieve some political objectives. These conclusions are not only inaccurate, they are absolutely wrong. The additional planning guidance we received from the Department of Defense on September 28 moved the likely timing of sequestration-related actions by the government by about 3 months into 2013, and we adjusted our schedule accordingly. So let me be very clear. We will issue WARN notices at the appropriate time if sequestration actions meet the required conditions in full compliance with the law, as we always have. We will work to assure that our employees are treated fully and fairly under the law, receiving protection under the WARN Act which, for us, has been and remains a high and nonnegotiable priority. And our sole interest and motivation throughout all the discussions about sequestration has been to understand the complex issues arising from this unprecedented circumstance, to be fully compliant with law and regulation and to take actions in the best interest of our company and our employees. We have done so, and we will continue to work to stop sequestration. So while I can't precisely forecast the impacts of sequestration or events that will unfold in a dynamic global security environment, there is one thing I know for certain. Every one of our 120,000 employees stands ready to take on whatever challenges will emerge. We worked hard over many years to build a culture based on ethics and integrity and high performance. We have a strategy that is tuned to the complex global security environment we face. We have extraordinary talent and dedicated employees who have fashioned an all-weather portfolio of global solutions for global customers, and we continue on our drive to reduce costs and meet affordability goals. We'll be happy to talk to you about these subjects and any other you may wish, but first, let's turn to Chris for an outline of our operational highlights. Chris?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Thanks, Bob. As you noted, from an operating perspective, we had a very strong quarter and maintained our positive momentum in an uncertain and challenging environment. We also continue to implement strategic actions to increase our customer alignment and drive affordability throughout the enterprise. We recently announced the de-layering and reorganization of our Electronic Systems business, resulting in 2 new business areas effective December 31. The businesses are Missiles and Fire Control, which focuses mainly on the mission of the Army and Special Operations Forces; and Mission Systems and Training, which supports the Navy and the Missile Defense Agency. This new structure will streamline management, reduce cost by $50 million a year and better position us to grow integrated services and support for our products. I'm also proud of our continuous efforts to improve affordability, and I would like to highlight 3 areas: First, we're leveraging engineering processes in advanced technology; second, we've improved supply chain integration; and finally, we've reduced our overhead cost. One of the best opportunities to drive affordability is in the design and technology insertion phase, where we make decisions in concert with our customers about how mission success will be achieved. We've developed Engineering for Affordability principles that center around rapid, transparent and collaborative decision-making to achieve mission success with the most affordable designs. Advanced technology is foundational to this approach. Application of advanced manufacturing processes and materials allows us to perform more rapid prototyping, reduce component costs, speed up the development process and shorten design cycles. We are training our engineering work force to bring cost to the forefront in all of our development programs. The supply chain is another focus area. About 50% of our program content is provided by our suppliers and teammates. As systems become increasingly complex, tight integration of this network of companies is key to maintaining affordability. To respond to this complexity, we have launched a focused effort to meet with our top suppliers and subcontractors to assure plans are in place to continuously improve their program execution, affordability and quality. We also have instituted corporate-wide agreements, which have generated more than $300 million in annual savings. Reducing overhead cost is another element of our approach to affordability. Our significant successes in this area include reduction of $1.2 billion in annual cost over the past 2 years, while remaining on target for an additional $1.1 billion this year. We've reduced 1.5 million square feet of facilities over the past 2 years and have additional planned reductions of 2.9 million square feet for 2012 through 2014. With the future uncertain, we will continue with our initiatives, remain agile and take further actions should sequestration occur. Turning to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Overall, the program continues to progress in development flight testing, solving technical challenges, increasing production deliveries and expanding international activities. Total flight test on the program have now been ahead of plan for the last 21 months. Year-to-date through September, test flights are ahead of plan by 181 flights or 25%, and test points are also ahead of plan by over 1,100 points or 17%. We currently have 15 aircraft executing this plan. With our IAM partners back to work, production activities also continue to expand as we delivered 12 aircraft in the third quarter, up significantly from second quarter deliveries of 3 aircraft. This brings year-to-date production deliveries to 17 aircraft, illustrating the program's maturity and progress. Internationally, the F-35 is maintaining strong partner support. This quarter, we delivered the first international aircraft to the United Kingdom with the acceptance of their initial STOVL aircraft. And Italy became the eighth international customer to formally fund procurement for aircraft. We continue to receive significant interest and inquiries from other international countries as they evaluate the F-35 for their next-generation fighter requirements. We recognize that the key to the long-term success of the F-35 program is delivering fifth-generation capability while driving down the cost of the aircraft as quickly as possible, and it is happening. Our later cost curve for assembling aircraft is improving faster than any previous fighter program dating back over 40 years. As volume increases, we believe this has us positioned to achieve the unit recurring flyaway cost objective of $67 million in FY '12 dollars by 2018. We are achieving these results by implementing various cost-cutting programs such as streamlining aircraft assembly, reducing time between building jets and improving material flow. At Fort Worth earlier this week, I saw firsthand the improved aircraft processing flow and upgraded tooling that is helping to drive down the cost below the government's baseline estimates. In summary, the program is demonstrating increasing maturity, tempo and affordability, and the JSF team looks forward to providing this critical asset to our nation and our allies. Now I'll turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance.
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of the third quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.9 billion, similar to what we generated in the second quarter this year. Our segment operating profit margin was strong at 12.1%, and I'll discuss that in more detail in a couple of charts. Earnings per share grew 11% to $2.21. Our cash from operations was a robust $1.6 billion, and we increased our quarterly dividend by 15% to $1.15 per share while also increasing our outlook for sales, earnings, EPS and operating cash for the full year. Lastly, in our release today, we provided preliminary 2013 financial trends and pension information, and I'll discuss those in a little more detail in later charts as well. On Chart 4, we'll look at sales by the 4 business areas. Aeronautic sales were 7% lower than in the third quarter of last year, driven primarily by lower C-130 deliveries and F-22 production volume. Electronic Systems sales grew 4% in the quarter as all 3 lines of business had growth over the same period last year. As expected, IS&GS had lower sales than last year, but the decline was only 1% as we experienced continued growth in our Intelligence line of business, driven by federal cyber activities. Space Systems sales were 5% lower than the same period last year as we had one commercial satellite delivery last year and none this quarter. So overall, a 2% decline in sales driven by lower aircraft quantities in the quarter and the timing of satellite deliveries. On a year-to-date basis, on Chart 5, you can see that 3 of the 4 business areas have experienced growth over the 2011 period with total sales up 2%. This strong performance led to the increase in our full year sales outlook. On Chart 6, we'll discuss our segment operating profit margins for the quarter. The primary reason for the 90 basis point margin increase to 12.1% was due to improvements in Electronic Systems and Space Systems. In Electronic Systems, the margin improved by 110 basis points to 13.3%. The improvement came from Missiles and Fire Control, primarily in air and missile defense programs and MS2 from our ship and aviation systems programs. The increased margin for Space Systems was primarily due to higher equity earnings from the United Launch Alliance and wind down activities associated with the United Space Alliance. The margins for Aeronautics and IS&GS were relatively comparable to last year. Turning to Chart 7 and our earnings per share in the quarter. EPS from continuing operations grew 11% over the amount reported last year, driven mostly by the higher margins in the quarter. And adjusting our reported EPS for the effects of the FAS/CAS adjustment, increases our EPS to $2.60 per share. If you'll turn to Chart 8, you can see our operating cash flow performance in the quarter compared with last year. Operating cash was just under $1.6 billion this quarter compared to $551 million last year. But last year included nearly $1 billion in pension contributions. And considering the strong performance so far this year, we again increased our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to greater than, or equal to, $4 billion for the year. On Chart 9, we'll discuss the dividend increase in the quarter, our 10th consecutive year of double-digit increases. You can see the dramatic increase in dividend levels and yield over the past 5 years with the current yield in 2012 more than twice what it was in 2008. And the increase brings our annualized dividend yield to just about 5% based on recent prices. On Chart 10, we'll discuss our updated guidance. Due to the year-to-date sales performance, we increased our sales outlook by $500 million. We increased segment operating profit by $175 million. We also increased earnings per share by $0.30, as I'll detail on the next chart. And again, we increased our cash from operations by $100 million. Chart 11 shows our earnings per share outlook reconciliation. You can see that the segment margin -- segment operating profit increase was the primary reason for adding $0.30 to our guidance, reflecting the increased earnings outlook by each of the 4 business areas. Chart 12 shows our increased sales guidance, with all 4 business areas increasing guidance for the year, resulting in the $500 million increase in total. Space Systems has the largest increase, $250 million, reflecting strong government satellite activity. And Electronic Systems increased by $150 million with growth coming from both MS2 and Missiles and Fire Control. Chart 13 shows our new segment operating profit guidance. Here again, all 4 business areas are increasing their outlook for the year with the largest increases also coming from Electronic Systems and Space Systems, and the total increase for the year equaling $175 million. On Chart 14, we'll discuss the preliminary trends we see for 2013. First, our trend data does not assume the impacts of sequestration as there are still many unknowns remaining as to how sequestration would be implemented if enacted. With that caveat, we expect a low single-digit decline in our total sales volume. Aeronautics and Electronic Systems are expected to be roughly comparable with 2012 levels. Space is expected to be down slightly due to the absence of any commercial satellite deliveries in 2013. And for IS&GS, we are expecting to decline in the mid single-digit range resulting primarily from the continued downturn in federal IT budgets. IS&GS also is expected to have the greatest impact from the continuing resolution due to the short-cycle nature of the business. We expect our segment operating margin will remain above 11% next year, the seventh consecutive year that our margin will exceed 11%. And with an assumed 75 basis point reduction in the discount rate at year end down to 4% and an 8% return on assets this year, our FAS/CAS pension adjustment is expected to be $700 million, about $135 million lower than the 2012 level. Finally, we expect the level of pension contributions next year to be comparable to this year's level, although I'll remind you that we'll be considering potential discretionary contributions between now and year end, consistent with our historical practice. And finally, we wrap up with our summary on Chart 15. The third quarter built upon the strong performance we've demonstrated this year, and our increased outlook reflects our expectation that 2012 will be a very solid year. We continue to return value to shareholders with our industry-leading dividend yield, and we'll be providing detailed guidance on the January call reflecting our new business area alignments. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris for final thoughts before we open up for questions. Chris?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Well, thanks, Bruce. I just wanted to take a quick minute and remind everyone that this is Bob's last earning call as he steps down as CEO later this year and, therefore, he won't be joining us on future calls. Despite knowing his aversion to personal praise and accolades, I want to thank him for his service and stewardship of our corporation. Bob's leadership and passion have been embedded in the DNA of our corporation. His focus on mentoring and training the next-generation leaders has created the deepest bench strength in the industry and will serve the corporation for decades to come. On a personal note, I've had the privilege of working with Bob for over a decade in my various roles, and I've seen his passion for the mission and his drive for excellence demonstrated on a daily basis. I know many of you on the call have also had the pleasure and opportunity to interact with Bob over the years. So Bob, I'd like to speak for all of us, and thank you for your contributions, and wish you the best. With that, I'll open up the lines for questions, Ally, and we stand by to answer.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: First, Bob, it's hard to believe it's your last earnings call, and just wanted to say it's been great working with you over the years. I mean, you've always provided some great insights regarding both the company and the industry, and so I wish you all the best going forward. But I'd like to get one more insight from you on a favorite topic here, which is the F-35. If you look back over your last several years, could you describe how the F-35 program has changed in 2 ways? First, how has Lockheed Martin's relationship with the customer evolved since negotiations always appear to be pretty tense and neither of you has much of an alternative to the other? And then second, how has Lockheed Martin's approach to performance change along with that of the program office so you can avoid some of the pitfalls that we saw farther back in the past related to cost and quality and schedule? So perhaps you could give us a sense of those 2 things.
Robert J. Stevens: Sure, I'll do my best, Doug. Thanks for the kind comments. Let me start with the evolution of the program and customer relations. I actually think that with respect to expectations, we've been very, very close with all our customers, and I would extend that to members of the Congress. I think everybody understands that we have an aging tactical fighter fleet, that we need to recapitalize that fleet, that we need fifth-generation capabilities. And in the most ideal circumstance, we would not do this alone, but we would do this with friends and allies so that we would have both burden sharing on the cost and flexibility and interoperability on the mission capability side of that platform, and the F-35 does all those things. Since I was here at the beginning or the inception of the F-35 program, I know full well that no one really underestimated the challenge or the complexity of bringing online a fifth-generation airplane with 3 variants that would have the performance characteristics that are embedded in the F-35. And I would tell you in my best professional judgment having done this for a long time, while there are areas of challenges that we continue to work on, there are other areas where we've done very well. And I think if you scale the size of this program, recall that many people talk about it being the biggest program or the most expensive program, but it is designed to replace more than 10 other kinds of airplanes. So that if you have an overrun of a percentage, it's a big overrun because it's a big complex program. Anytime we don't meet a performance commitment, we feel there's been a shortfall on our part, and we redouble our efforts to accomplish those goals. But I think the program has had the highest level of visibility, the most number of detailed reviews and absolutely the greatest level of transparency where you all on the call know the technical details of this program as it's unfolding almost at the same time the engineers responsible for the performance of the system know it. And I think there's some very good features of that, and I think there's some really lousy features of that because people come to the wrong conclusion because they haven't done this before as to what is a likely outcome about resolving a technical issue. So we know that it's not easy, but this program is succeeding. And I'll ask Chris to comment in a moment because it's worth the time to comment. He spent time in Fort Worth with the new Chief of Staff of the Air Force, who's deeply involved in this program. Chris will give you his own assessment. You mentioned customer relations. It's a challenging program, but I personally believe the customer wants what we want, and we will do everything that we must do to have very high quality relations and get everything about this program right because the stakes for the country and for our friends and allies are just too damn high to set the bar anywhere else. With regard to our performance, we've always been realistic. We have superb subject matter expertise here. I would put our high-speed combat tactical fighter airplane program credentials against any other company on this planet, and I believe there are those who would kill to have the capabilities we have in not only our company, but remember, the extensive supply chain that we built for the F-35 around the world. So it's a complicated program, but it is improving in its dimensions. We're happy to pick ourselves up and move ourselves forward. When we're doing well, we'll tell you. When we're not doing well, we'll redouble our efforts to get this right. Chris, you have some insight. You've been in Fort Worth just this week.
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Yes, thanks, Bob. Doug, a couple things I may want to point out is, we actually have 94 aircraft in production flow between Fort Worth, Marietta and the Italian facility. So we have LRIP 3 aircraft all the way up through and including our first LRIP 7 airplane. So I'm not sure everyone appreciates the quantity and the speed at which these aircraft are, in fact, being produced. And as I look ahead to next year, we will actually deliver more F-35s in 2013 than the F-16 and the C-130J combined. So the volume is picking up. The production is going well, and the customer has been very satisfied in the deliveries that we've made. And as many of you may know, even later this year, the Marine Corps is preparing for its first operational base for the F-35 at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma. So there's some outside perspective to give you the volume and the progress that we're making. I guess specifically you asked about the relationship and General Bogdan was in Fort Worth recently, last week, if I recall, had very productive meetings with the team. We're very excited about him taking over, and we're looking forward to working with him. And we're both committed to 100% strong -- 100% commitment to a strong and collaborative relationship. As Bob said, I was recently, this week, down with General Welsh. He's very engaged. He was checking on the status of his aircraft, and both these gentlemen are very demanding. They hold us to the highest standards possible, and we actually prefer that. So we're looking forward to a great 2013 on F-35 and much more after that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes, Bob, a couple of years ago, you laid out a vision for making Lockheed a global security company. And, in a way, one can see the proposed move with EADS and BAE as some attempts to -- for others to catch up on that. Can you expand a little bit on what you see going forward in terms of pressing on, on that vision? Do you think that you would be looking -- that the company would be looking for international acquisitions or pieces of that to sort of build more of a global perspective?
Robert J. Stevens: Yes, thanks for the question, Heidi. When we talked years ago about a global security company, we were not necessarily focusing on international acquisitions as much as expanding international opportunities by building the core portfolio of the business that would address the emerging or evolving needs. Of course, at the time, we were talking about cyber security. When I think others weren't talking about cyber security, we were talking about moving more into services business and support and logistics for the core that we have. I will tell you, I'm really quite pleased with the portfolio that we have and how well that portfolio is maturing. Now I will certainly say in the same breath that which was embedded in Doug's question, we want to do a better job on the F-35. We know there are areas where we need to improve, and I think we're a company that realistically looks at that. But I'm very pleased with the portfolio. So as we look at the evolution of global security now, we take into account the evolution of world economic conditions that I think, generally, we would describe as showing signs of stress, and the stress may be different depending upon what region of the world we look at. But generally, we've concluded there'll be fewer resources available to our customers, wherever those customers may be, relative to meeting what is essentially a growing set of demands in the global security environment, which tells us, as we evolve this portfolio into international opportunities, we must continue to drive on affordability and cost reduction. And I think we're doing that effectively, and we have not stopped the continuous pursuit of refining that model. I think we've done a very good job of exploiting partnerships internationally, rather than making the international acquisitions as the only avenue to extend the range of our company, we've sought out very high-quality partners who bring immediate value-added credentials to enhance our offerings. And I think you should look for more of that from us. But you should also think of us relative to acquisitions in terms of extending the string-of-pearls approach of very selective, very high-quality, very easy to integrate, very specific and purposeful additions to the business. So I do expect more from Chris and the leadership team on extending the global security reach of the company.
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Yes, Heidi. I'll just -- it's Chris. I'll give you a little more insight. Here in the third quarter, 25% of our orders were actually from international customers. And as you know we're -- currently about 17% of our revenue is derived from foreign military sales and direct commercial sales. I see it halfway to about 20%, and I think that's based on the strength of the portfolio, as Bob said. And when you look at Missile Defense with PAC-3 and THAAD, the precision-guided weapons and of course, the aircraft, I'd be disappointed if we're not at that 20% goal in the next couple of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Loomis at Stifel, Nicolaus.
William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I have a question on IS&G [ph] on the outlook. You talked about a lower, mid single-digit decline next year, yet you've won some pretty substantial contracts, the DISA/GSM-O and DoD/DC3 are just 2 of them. What's going away as some of these bigger wins you've had are ramping up over the next year?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Bill, this is Bruce. I'll take that one on. I think -- when I think about IS&GS going to next year, there's really sort of 2 pressures that we see occurring kind of simultaneously. One is, as you're well aware of, there is a 6-month continuing resolution at least for the first 6 months of the fiscal year. I'll remind you that IS&GS is the shorter cycle business of our -- of all of our business areas, and therefore, it converts the most sales from the current fiscal year of any of our business areas. So that continuing resolution period caused us to have some pause from some increases that might otherwise have happened had that not been in place. And the second element that's causing some pressure in '13 is simply the overall federal IT budget. And if you take a look at where the federal IT budget is planned for 2013 and beyond, it has some significant reductions from the previous year's level, and being that we're the largest provider of IT services for 18 straight years, it's hard to overcome that sort of budget reduction when you're as big a player in that marketplace as we are. So those are really the 2 biggest drivers going into next year. And I wouldn't want to split it up and say, which one's the bigger contributor. But I'd say that probably, if I was, it would be the overall IT budget reductions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First off, Bob, great working with you over a very long period of time, and best wishes to you. I have a more mundane question, just on the change in Electronic Systems and the restructuring there or the realignment there. Just on the surface, it doesn't seem like breaking one segment into 2 would save money. And, obviously, that's what you guys are in the business are doing these days. So maybe if you could help elaborate on why that saves money. And if it's just a matter of taking a layer out, why wasn't it done previously? Just finally, on the same point, does this -- can we read anything into this in terms of potential portfolio moves next year?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Joe, this is Chris. I'll take an attempt at that. The way we eliminate cost in this is that we've eliminated a layer between the businesses, and then ultimately, the executive office. If you go back in history, maybe a decade ago or so, we had probably 12 individual entities, maybe all in the $0.5 billion to $1 billion range in the Electronic Systems business area oversaw and managed that broad portfolio. Over time, we've consolidated and combined each of those entities, most recently with the Owego being combined into our MS2 business. Prior to that, I think the Eagan facility as well. So when we looked at the current alignment, we had about 4 businesses reporting in, and we thought they'd gotten to the scale and the size that we could consolidate them. Each of these will themselves eliminate some cost, and we're looking at probably close to 200 of our employees will be laid off as part of this process here in the coming months. And I think it was the right thing to do, and it was the right time to do it.
Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: In terms of portfolio moves, anything we can read into it, Chris?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: No, no. It was just too -- like I said, to eliminate the cost, get closer to the customer and better align our training and services business with the underlying core product. So that's all there was to it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lewis from Lazard Capital Markets.
Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: My question is how do you see the book to bill ending out Q4? And I think the more important question is, have you noted any momentum from the POs on getting awards out the door quicker following the year end and now moving into the next fiscal year?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Michael, this is Bruce. I'll take that one on. Book to bill wise, let me just -- maybe just address it with sort of a backlog perspective. I think we're at $75.6 billion or something like that through the end of the third quarter. That's basically tracking where we thought we'd be at this time. We're actually probably a little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be otherwise. I've said on previous calls, and I'll say on this one, I still think we will end the year fairly close to where we began the year at close to $80 billion of backlog. And the orders that need to happen in the fourth quarter, there's very few of them that are, I'll say, competitive orders. Most of them are sort of just fiscal year orders that happen every year. And they're not the sort of orders that are subject to the sequestration limits because they're not necessarily large orders that are increasing over the prior fiscal year's last year same time frame. The one big item that we're watching is in order to get to that level that I talked about again close to where we started the year and from a backlog perspective, we need to close on the F-35 LRIP 5 contract and get the additional fundings from an undefinitized [ph] contractual action for Lot 6 on that. We stand here today thinking that can be done in the fourth quarter, and that's the basis of the planning that we have for the end of the year for that backlog number. As far as your second question, some acceleration, I think we saw some of that throughout the year. That's again one of the reasons are why I think we were ahead of where we thought we might otherwise be at the end of the third quarter. And I think people that -- I can't remember, Chris or whoever said it earlier but some comments about unfunded obligations and trying to get funds put on contract as we head into a sequestration environment. I think we saw some customer actions doing that. It's hard to put a figure on that, if you will, but I think we did see some or experience some that earlier this year as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Bob, best of luck with the next chapter. A quick question just as a bit of a follow on kind of taking the last questioner's topic one step further and talk about '13 as it relates to the opportunity set. Assuming that sequester, there's some sort of resolution there, what are the things that are going to drive backlog and book to bill next year? And given the pipeline and the visibility that you have, is it possible for us to continue to maintain a book to bill around 1?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: So Jason, this is Chris. Let me give you a couple of the larger opportunities and orders that we're looking at. We have F-16 in Iraq. We have a multiyear potential for the C-130J with the U.S. government. We have the next tranche of C-5 aircraft. And while it probably wouldn't be an order, but there is a decision for the F-35 in South Korea. I think that might actually hit the books when we're successful in 2014, but the decision should be announced later this year in 2013. So we see those opportunities in Aeronautics, in the Space business. Of course, Orion, we're looking at 2 more Cerberus satellites, and there's actually a couple commercial satellites internationally that we're in current discussions with. So I see opportunities there as well. The former Electronic Systems, a couple more Littoral Combat Ships, as I mentioned in my upfront comments, missile defense between Egypt and PAC-3 and THAAD we see lots of opportunities, not only here but around the globe. And then within IS&GS, there's several opportunities including a couple international, specifically in Australia and working with the Missile Defense Agency here. So it's a pretty broad portfolio. Some of these are competitive. Some are follow-on, but we're pretty optimistic about the 2013 opportunities to grow this enterprise.
Robert J. Stevens: Yes, and Jason you asked the question could we kind of hold -- I think if I understood your question right, could we kind of hold to the level of backlog that we end this year. Now we still think we'll end the year 2013 assuming the orders that Chris just described come through at about, again, for another year have about the $80 billion level as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: First of all, best of luck for the future, Bob. It's been quite a ride.
Robert J. Stevens: Thank you.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: The question I have is regarding the dividend. You highlighted that you've raised dividend again quite recently, another double-digit increase. You're now paying it over 50% of earnings, over 50% of free cash flow. How much longer can these double-digit increases continue until they start to get a little bit unsustainable?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Yes, Rob. I'll take that one on. We -- I think we've been very pleased with the dividend increases and what we think this brought in terms of, I'll say, at least from my perspective, a little bit of price stability, and I think a little bit of price floor to the stock price since we've increased the dividend here recently to the levels that we have now. Several years back under Bob and Chris' leadership, we committed to providing 50% or more of free cash flow in the form of either dividends or share repurchases. I'm pleased to say with the increases we've given in dividends, we now do that strictly by the dividends that we do provide. If we just stop there with dividends, you're already at the 50% of free cash flow. As I look this year and next year, I mean, the first thing that I tend to do when I look at the dividend and payouts and the like is I do adjust for the FAS/CAS. So if I was to do that this year, for instance, I think we'd add back $1.60 or so for the FAS/CAS impact to our numbers and therefore, the earnings per share gets close to a $10 per share number. So when you kind of get on the cash-on-cash basis, the dividends are less than 50% as I would view it today. And I think going forward, the question is how much cash do we need to invest in the company to support the growth rate of the company. We're generating far more cash today than we need to support the growth rate, particularly when that growth rate starts to slow going forward. And so going forward, I still believe we will be generating more cash than we need to support the growth of the company, and we will have the opportunity when CAS Harmonization kicks in, in particular the next 2 years to recover a lot of the discretionary, and not just discretionary but that's a big piece of it, pension payments that we've paid in the last few years. And that will have the effect of increasing cash over what you might ordinarily think as sort of an average run rate. I'll remind you that we have some $4 billion of advanced funding in our pension plan that is yet to be recovered under our government contracts. So as CAS Harmonization plays out over the next few years, that will be added to sort of this the average run rate, if you will, of cash generation. And I think that's where the opportunity to continue with dividends and other cash deployment actions, not just dividends, will come from.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, and Bob, let me join the other folks in congratulating you on a job extraordinarily well done.
Robert J. Stevens: Thanks, Cai.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So pension, $700 million, walk us through some of the assumptions, I guess, you talked a little bit about the discount rate that's like where is your return, what are you assuming for return on assets and where are you year-to-date? What should we look for CAS to do next year? What should we look for your contributions to be next year?
Bruce L. Tanner: Cai, I'll take that one also. So pensions were -- we changed our long-term rate, I'd say the start of this year, I guess, end of last year to 8% per year. We're tracking very nicely to that as we sit here today. I think the overall global markets are above that, and we're tracking, I'll say, nicely with what a little less than 2 months to go on the year, but I feel good about what our returns are for this year. Next year's numbers were also premised -- well, I'll back up. Next year's numbers were premised on us achieving 8% this year. So that's the starting point. And as far as the CAS cost next year by itself, I'm trying to recall that, but I think the CAS cost itself goes up to like 1 point -- think of it $1.4-ish billion or so. Think of a FAS number, if we stop today somewhere around $2.1 billion, and that's how you get to the $700 million FAS/CAS adjustment. And the contributions that we're expecting to make next year are essentially the same as this year, you should think as $1.1-ish billion range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Chris, I wanted to go back to something you had said earlier in the call. You talked about $1.2 billion of overhead reduction in the last few years and on the docket for another $1.1 billion this year. I guess I'm trying to just understand, how much does it cost for you to actually accomplish that? What kind of returns do you get, and then how much of that do you actually get to keep as opposed to it ultimately going back to the customer?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Yes, Sam. That's a great question. It varies by business area. This is pretty much the overhead reduction. A lot of this ties to some of the facility. I gave you some numbers on the facility square footage that were taken out. We do a business case and a payback for all these affordability projects that we have. And generally, they pay back within the 12- to 18-month cycle. So when we do something like facility consolidation, we'll be moving the cost of moving the cost of consolidating as it relates to that. Right now, we're about 50% cost plus 50% fixed price. So half goes in back to the government, if you will. The other half generally is built into our forward pricing to some degree. It really depends on the backlog mix. But the investment to get these overhead savings are not that significant and generally results in both people and capital assets as the main driver. Of course, we're focused on processes and new systems and such, but it's a pretty quick payback.
Robert J. Stevens: And Sam, I'll -- let me add to that. The conversation that we have internally here has placed a greater emphasis on this general subject of affordability and cost reduction because with or without sequestration, we know that we're facing a long cycle where the demands of our security customers are going to go up relative to their missions, and they're not going to have the economic resources available to meet those growing demands. And we've got to get out in front of this. So we're pushing ourselves, and Chris is absolutely right, and embedded in your question is the notion. You certainly want to pick the highest payoff opportunities and do them the soonest, and we are. But I'm not and we've not been reluctant to look at all sorts of cost-reduction opportunities even if they have a longer payback, as long as they payback because it's going to be a longer cycle process that we're involved with where it's going to take continuous refinement, continuous refocusing. And one of the benefits that we think we achieved from some of these reorganizations is not necessarily measured in the economic return but in our ability to have greater levels of agility and more refined resource allocation. So we can move with the increasing rate of the volatility in our markets. One of the characteristics we've seen out on the marketing horizon is this shorter cycle, much more highly volatile environment where change is occurring more quickly, and you have to be able to respond to that change. And so there's sort of this proportionality between the size and structure of the organization and the ability to move quick at the edge. And we're getting better at moving quick to the edge, and with that, we can take cost out of the business.
Bruce L. Tanner: Sam, you might get a triple out of this one because I'll speak to this one also, and I think I'm going to go back to something Chris said in his opening remarks. I think we're all good -- we've all demonstrated, we've all done this throughout our careers of taking the kind of actions to reduce facilities' headcount when it's required. And I don't think that's necessarily all that newsworthy or all that new and innovative. What Chris mentioned in his opening remarks that I'm talking about taking into account affordability into the design of products and sort of getting that upfront view of affordability, that's something I'm actually very excited about. And I think we've really just sort of scratched the surface on that. And as we see the chance to bid and win new products with that concept in mind, I think you will see some really interesting characteristics coming out of that because we are changing the nature of maybe how we've done that in years past in a manner and in a process that I think is going to pay off significantly to both ourselves and our customer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Bob, let me join everyone in congratulating you on all your successes. I think, Chris, he's left you with a pretty high bar for stock price performance, and I think as a shareholder, he'll hold you to it. So best of luck on that.
Robert J. Stevens: Thank you. He's up to it, Carter. He's up to it.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I want to expand on the last question, if you will. Obviously, your peers are sort of chasing down the cost curve as well to remain competitive, and I wondered if you might tell us how it is that you benchmark yourself against the peer group to see how well of a job you're actually doing and getting cost out. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of overhead that's going to need to come out of the industrial base, given the budget forecast that we're looking at even out without sequestration. And so I wondered if you might share with us how it is that you benchmark yourself, and then give us kind of an assessment of where you are relative to your peers and your efforts so far.
Robert J. Stevens: Yes, I'll be very blunt about this. We started to take cost out before our peers, and we had no reservation about being the first mover here as there are an extraordinary number of metrics that we can benchmark ourselves to. We think one of the most meaningful ones is examining our win rate when we get our feedback from our customer. How many competitions are we losing because we were not cost competitive because that brings at home more clearly than anything else. I think what will give us the competitive advantage as we move forward with a competitive group that is also attempting to remove cost is we've made significant new investments in new products, where others have older product lines that will require new investments. For example, we have the Littoral Combat Ship. We have the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter which is a fifth-generation capability. We've refreshed Aegis to an open architecture. We evolved PAC-3, and we're evolving the THAAD missile system. These are all new and fresh technologies. We have a similar portfolio in Space Systems. The vitality and the vibrancy and the recent investment in these new next-generation systems I think has a lot more legs in a competitive climate, particularly in a climate where we'll be taking cost out. So our goal here is to focus on the benchmarks in the industry. We're entirely comfortable of front running the industry when we have confidence in knowing what we have to do and how we have to do it, and we have that confidence. We think we have a relevant portfolio that's proven. And as we drive higher levels of affordability, we think we'll pass that metric of cost competitiveness in competitive awards as we look forward.
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Yes, Carter, and I'm glad you asked the follow-up question because we do spend a lot of time talking about affordability. And the point I was trying to get across is it's more than the cost cutting. We talked about the supply chain, and Bruce reemphasized the importance of the engineering and design. We can go on all day, but another very, very important element is the volume. And the executive leadership team spends a fair amount of their time traveling the globe, building relationships, meeting with customers because we all know whatever product it is, if we can get some of our allies and friends around the globe to also purchase airplanes or missiles, not only does the U.S. government benefit but they benefit as well just from a financial perspective. There's obviously a strategic, operational and other benefits of a coalition warfare. But that's another leg of the affordability, and we spend a lot of time trying to grow this business. And that's one of the benefits that all of our customers realize.
Jerry F. Kircher: Ally, this is Jerry. Just to be sure, I've got a note here that there's 7 people in the queue. We have some ability to go longer today, so we'd like to catch the people that are still in the queue. So we're going to extend the call, if that's all right. So let's do the next caller.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Safran of Buckingham Research.
Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Bob, once again, best wishes. I wanted to just ask about, if I might, about build rates at Aeronautics, C-130J, C-5 and F-16. I think you're delivering 34 C-130Js this year, 37 F-16s if I got my numbers right. Just wanted to know if you could comment if you're anticipating similar run rates next year, or could this moderate some? Also, I know you're tracking a bunch of new orders and I just wanted to know if any of them you think might impact '13 deliveries.
Bruce L. Tanner: Rich, this is Bruce. I'll take that one on. Chris made an interesting observation relative to our expectations next year with the F-35 deliveries surpassing both C-130 line and the F-16 line. I think that's kind of the new era that we're facing in the corporation, an era where obviously the F-35 is going to become the dominant production line in the corporation. And it started this quarter, the third quarter with more deliveries for the F-35 in this quarter than any of the other 2 aircraft as well. As we look into 2013, and I look at Aeronautics in general, there's a lot of mix that's going on within Aeronautics. In my prepared remarks, I said that Aeronautics is going to be relatively comparable next year from a revenue perspective to where they are this year, but there's a lot of moving pieces in that number. So you're spot on with the aircraft quantities that you gave for 2012. You should expect somewhere on the order of 20 to 25 fewer F16s next year than this year, and that's predominantly because we're building in 2012 some 24 aircraft for the government of Turkey, and they're actually being built off the Turkish line. So while we hate to lose the aircraft, I guess the good news of that discussion is that, really, the aircraft build rate at Fort Worth won't change from 2012 and 2013. So there's an element of stability there that might not be apparent, given the quantity changes. We're also looking to lower the C-130 build rate. You're right, the numbers, we should do 33, 34 this year or so. We're going to ramp back down to about a 24 per month -- or I wish it's a month, 24 aircraft per year build rate on the C-130 beginning next year, and we think that, that level allows us to have again sort of a stable build line for a number of years going into the future. And then offsetting those 2 reductions, which may not be all that apparent, I don't think you mentioned C-5 but we're going to deliver 3 or 4 of the C-5 in the RERP aircraft or Re-engining and Reliability Improvement Program for C-5s. And those 3 or 4 will grow to probably close to 10 or so next year. We're getting very close to the sort of the maximum rate on the C-5 program, which I think it's about 11 aircraft per year to modify those 49 C-5 into the RERP configuration. So between the lower F-16s, the fewer C-130s, higher C-5 and then the missing piece is higher F-35 volume next year, Aeronautics is going to stay relatively comparable. But again, as I just indicated, a lot of moving pieces in that discussion.
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: And Rich, you asked us, while we'll be working hard to get new orders over the next several months, none of those would impact 2013 deliveries, it would be beyond the calendar year.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I think this one's probably for Bruce. In terms of your guidance for 2013, not exactly sure what above 11% means, but in terms of the margins, but if you could help us a little bit with the big pieces that would impact margin next year, obviously a little bit lower volume. I think USA is going away, level of cume adjustments and whatever else you want to throw in there.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, I'm not sure I'm going to get at this point, David, any more specific than what we provided in the press release relative to the margins that we did say. I do think we're going to be above 11%. I think as I said in my remarks seventh consecutive year where we have been above 11%. As we look at 2013, maybe what I ought to do is just kind of go around by the business areas and talk a little bit of that. I spent a lot of time just talking to Aeronautics, I think Aeronautics revenue I should say. If I think of the earnings around the margin of Aeronautics, because of all the mix changes that I just described, I think we'll have slightly lower margins at Aeronautics primarily because of the mix changes that I just described. We're losing some F-16s and losing some C-130s at higher margins and replacing that with C-5 and F-35 at lower margins. I still think we'll be in the 11-ish percent range for Aeronautics. So not a huge drop-off but probably not as high as this year. If I go over to Electronic Systems, I think Electronic Systems is probably the one business area I can look at and say even with the numbers I'm seeing now, I'm hopeful at least that there will be some potential for some modest growth there above even what I'm thinking of for 2013. And relative to the margins, I think the margins will stay at the 13-plus percent range. I'll qualify that though by saying that we're going to give you in January a new configuration with 2 new business areas. So I'll say I'll hold that thought till January, but I'll give you the data in the current configuration. And I would say we're going to stay fairly close to where we are today from a margin perspective in all of Electronic Systems. Space Systems is likely going to be down slightly, primarily because we will have slightly lower equity earnings because of the USA closure. For all intents and purpose that, that joint venture is coming to a close this year. Despite that, I think with some of the production satellite programs that are now going through the production phase and are well out of the developmental phase, we're seeing some higher margins on those contracts, and I think that we'll probably see margins a little bit lower. But I would guess in the mid-11 for Space Systems going next year, they've had a benefit this year from a couple of the closeouts that we talked about the wind down of the USA that won't replicate next year. And then I guess the last, IS&GS, I would think it will follow very closely to where we are now, somewhere in the 9-ish percent margin range. I think I covered all 4 of them, David, probably more detail than you care to hear, but I think that covers it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Bob, again, congratulations, and best wishes.
Robert J. Stevens: Thanks, Rob.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Two -- I'll try to make them quick. One for Chris, one for Bruce. Bruce, I'll just start with you. On your color on '13, are you assuming full obligation of CR funds to spending authority limits, or do you embed some kind of cushion for this half-paralyzed environment we've seen at times this year because unless we assume full resolution of sequester by early '13, I would think -- and formal adoption of the fiscal '13 president's request, might we think of this as a best case scenario at least for revenues?
Bruce L. Tanner: Rob, I thought about that quite a bit, and I don't think so. I don't think it's the best case scenario. I mean, obviously the worst case would be a sequester, but is this a best case? I'm not sure of that. We have very...
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Negotiated outcome would be something between what I think your assumptions are and full sequester.
Robert J. Stevens: Rob, let me -- so when we paid this, they're -- now we're talking about some combinatorial -- some possibilities here. But it is possible we'll have a CR through March 27, and it's possible that a CR will be extended. There are also appropriation bills that have been marked, and a fair amount of effort has been gone into, let me say, preparing those bills to move. So it is possible the bill could move even without a resolution to sequester because part of these interesting combinations that make any detailed planning on our part impossible as to what the outcomes could be would be a movement of the appropriation bills and some deferral sequestration while a more thoughtful process to achieve what's called the larger or the big transaction, the full scope resolution that includes tax policy, entitlement reform and defense and nondefense discretionary spending. That could occur too. Thereby, lifting the opportunity in 2013 with regard to appropriated levels of funding rather than CR levels of funding. So there are interesting combinations here that could either put a little pressure on '13 or actually relieve some pressure on '13. Sorry to interrupt you, Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner: No, I was -- Bob is talking in much more detail and thorough answer probably than I was going to do. Rob, the other thing I was going to say is I'll just remind you of our portfolio as you go around the 4 business areas, really Aeronautics and Space Systems for a large intent and purposes don't have much impact to the CR because most of their sales are coming from fiscal year '13 budgets. So very -- I'm not sure I used the word insulated but very little impact from there. IS&GS, as I've said many times, short-cycle business would be the most subject to CR. But frankly, we weren't expecting a whole lot of growth year-over-year, fiscal year over fiscal year in that business to begin with. And then Electronic Systems is somewhere in between. I think you had a question for Chris that you didn't get to ask, Rob.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Best wishes, Bob. A couple of follow-ups and clarifications. You didn't mention when you're talking about bookings the larger Space contract that I think was a 2012 opportunity, and I don't think you mentioned it within the realm of the '13 opportunities either. Is that still on the table? And I guess, Bruce, it's not implied to get to $80 billion, you need this to happen.
Bruce L. Tanner: Rob, I'll just say our government satellite -- or I'm sorry, Myles. That's 2 calls in a row. I called you the wrong name, Myles. I'll just leave it and say that our government satellite business is very healthy, strong and well supported. The $80 billion achievement if we're able to get that this year, I didn't mention that re-alliance [ph] on government satellites because I'm not concerned about that relative to our ability to achieve that number.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just to clarify. So you don't need it to achieve the number?
Bruce L. Tanner: We do not.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then the other question was really more around the F-35 and the overall life cycle opportunity, which has always been a key part of that program. It sounds like the customer wants to, not surprisingly, insert some competition to maintain pricing discipline. Has your view changed on Lockheed Martin's ability to capture that tail of the program and really make it into the bigger opportunity that's always been if you could capture that aftermarket strength?
Robert J. Stevens: Well, Myles, we, one, know the program pretty well, know the demands. Nobody wants to lower the total cost of operation of this airplane more than we do along with our customers. We see competition in every aspect of this business every day, and we certainly not only don't fear the competition, it actually makes us better. I think our customers realize that. So if there are competitive opportunities here that also lower the total cost of operation, we are certainly going to pursue them and pursue them aggressively. I think we have the insight that one would have from being the design agent and the prime contractor overseeing the supply chain. I think we are as able as anybody to provide very high-quality, very low-cost support service throughout the life cycle of this airplane. So we'll look forward to these discussions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Arment of Sterne Agee.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Congratulations, Bob. Chris, a question regarding -- I guess when you were talking about the reorganization and taking cost out, and I can appreciate stripping out some of the management. But I'm surprised you're not seeing -- doing more I guess in IS&GS, given that, that's where you're seeing the most delay awards or scope reductions, and the customers have been focused on price. Is there opportunity there to continue to take cost out, or is it just not businesses that you want to break out for competitive reasons?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Yes, Peter. We think we've been very aggressive in taking out cost. I think back a couple of years, I think we had over 145,000 employees. We're currently at 120,000. We don't announce but we're happy to talk about the layoffs. There've been significant layoffs probably every quarter for the last 8 quarters. We highlighted this because of the reorganization, but we've streamlined over the years, I recall when IS&GS had about 11 different companies, if you will, or components, we're now down to 3, civil and defense and Intel line of business. We're very competitive. Bob mentioned, we look at our win rates on occasion when we lose competition. I'm not aware of any competition in IS&GS where we've lost as a result of cost. So again, we've done a fair amount. We'll continue to look at it. And of the $1.1 billion, I'm sure a couple of hundred million of that is coming out of the IS&GS. I just didn't differentiate it or highlight it for you.
Operator: The last question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Congrats, Bob, on your last call.
Robert J. Stevens: Thanks, Noah.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Since I'm last, I'm going to try to sneak in 2 follow-ups to some of the other conversations you had. So the first one is with regard to the potential strategies with which sequestration could be avoided, Bob, I wonder, are there 1 or 2 kind of bigger things that are being discussed on the Hill that are floating to the top? And what are the high points of them, if there are? And then secondarily and separately, on the margin topic, you mentioned in your remarks you've had 6 or 7 years in a row with the segment operating margin above 11%. I basically wonder if you think you can repeat that. You've talked about the cost reductions and productivity improvements. On the other hand, you have a generally tougher customer, presumably these EAC adjustments wind down and become a headwind. Is that 11% kind of a reasonable longer-term margin, or does it need to come down?
Robert J. Stevens: Yes, I'll start with the discussion about strategies for sequestration. Of course, on the hill now, there is no discussion because we're in the recess prior to the election. To perhaps oversimplify this but maybe a little over simplification is good because it is really a complex set of scenarios right now. Three things -- one of 3 things will likely happen. We'll get a resolution or the grand bargain outcome, which tends to have value ranges of $4 trillion to $5 trillion, which is a significant amount of work that would go in, looking at tax, looking at entitlement, looking at spending. The onset of sequestration could be delayed beyond January 2 maybe to be coterminal with the CR in March or maybe beyond that or sequestration will take effect. My sense is the latter 2 are a little bit more likely than the first one. It would seem to be hard to get a grand bargain in a lame-duck session of the Congress. So my guess is we'll either see a delay of the onset or sequestration will take place. When you think about sequestration taking place, we already received from the Department of Defense additional planning guidance that we received on September 28 that said, they don't anticipate taking any contract actions on January 2. And they thought it was unlikely that they would take contract actions for several months beyond that, which puts us through our first fiscal quarter and puts the government into its second fiscal half before any impacts might be realized at least on the defense side. Civil government agencies are going to be different, and they don't have the large acquisition accounts, and a lot of their expenses are associated with people. So it's just not clear. I know every one of us wants to be in a position of doing better at predicting what will happen with respect to sequestration. But I can tell you, I don't know, and I don't know anybody who does know. There's a lot of speculation, but there's not greater clarity. So inside our company, we're preparing for the prospect of sequestration. As I said, we will issue WARN notices if that's required, if sequestration has reductions in force. We're working every day to try to avoid that. In the interim, we're asking our employees to stay very focused on the tasks at hand. And I think you see in the third quarter and in the year-to-date performance an exceptional quality by the talent in this company and their professionalism and staying focused on the goal, on the mission, on execution, and they are not being distracted by this. And for that, we are all so enormously proud of them for remaining focused like that. So the best we can do is try to keep you posted on how sequestration unfolds. Obviously, the next event would be what happens in the lame-duck session of Congress. Relative to margins, I do think that it is possible to sustain these margins over the long run, and we haven't given up on attempting to improve these margins. It has a lot to do with your portfolio. It has a lot to do with your business mix, and it has a lot to do with how well you're able to execute. And we make investments every day on building this portfolio to have real legs and real durability in a complex global security environment. We do focus every day on execution, and we're taking this business more broadly internationally and expect to have pretty robust opportunities to perform.
Bruce L. Tanner: So I'll just add, I think we are structurally different today and going forward than we were maybe a few years back, that has helped our situation as well. And Bob mentioned the international contact growing. I think that's one thing that contributes to the ability to maintain the 11%. We've talked a lot about our equity earnings. Those are companies that we did not have, I'll say, the margin boost from recognizing those equity earnings in years past, and that had -- sort of in the case of United Launch Alliance, that's sort of a double benefit because you lost the sales associated with that activity. So the margin improvement was pretty substantial. The last thing I'll point to sort of a structural change is if you just think of all the combinations that led to the current Lockheed Martin, a number of those brought with them intangible amortizations associated with those acquisitions. And those were a drag on margins in the early years of this corporation as well that no longer exist as we sit here today. Bob?
Robert J. Stevens: Thanks. First, let me thank everybody for being on the call. We had a long day. You had a longer day. So we appreciate you being here with us. I certainly appreciate your kind words and all the good wishes you offered me. I was thinking that since I became our company's Chief Financial Officer in 1999, we've had about 52 quarters together to have these exchanges, and I have really enjoyed the interaction that we've all shared over the years. I want to wish each of you well in your professional pursuits and certainly in your personal lives. At this end, I'm certain our company is in great hands with Chris and Marillyn and Bruce and Jerry and the other members of the executive team. I'm really grateful for having the privilege of working on this management team and having had the opportunity to work with my fellow employees here who are simply exceptional people who do extraordinary work in the nation's interest. I will miss them, and I will miss you, but I will be listening to these calls. So I'm sure that Chris and Bruce look forward to talking with all of us in January. We'll sign off from this end. Thank you.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry F. Kircher: Thank you, Karen, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kubasik, our Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert J. Stevens: Thanks, Jerry. Thanks, everyone, for being with us today. We'll proceed on the assumption that you had an opportunity to review our releases this morning. Since we last spoke in April, we've undertaken a fair amount of international travel to talk directly with our customers and government leaders, consistent with our strategy to increase our international work while we rebalance national security spending here in the United States. While all governments are clearly watching the global economic environment, all are keenly aware of growing security challenges. As we assess our portfolio, we believe we possess the systems, the capabilities, the skills and the resources to support our security cooperation partners around the globe. And I was very gratified to see strong broad-based operational performance in the second quarter throughout the company based on solid execution and discipline focus. We believe our portfolio gives us opportunities to continue to expand international sales. Relative to the government fiscal year '13 defense budget, the House has marked and committee both the Defense Authorization Bill and all 12 appropriation bills, including defense. And the Senate has marked the Defense Authorization Bill and committee and will likely mark the Defense Appropriation Bill by the end of this month. At this point, however, we do not expect the bills to be in place at the beginning of the government's fiscal year on October 1, but rather have a continuing resolution that will commence on 1 October and likely extend through the end of the calendar year, enabling the Congress to convene a lame duck session after the election where we believe a broader number of very important initiatives like the debt limit extension, entitlement reform tax policy and spending levels together, sometimes referred to as the fiscal cliff issues, will be addressed. Sequestration continues to be a great concern to us. There is at present very little insight or detailed understanding as to how sequestration will be implemented even though this law requiring an additional $55 billion reduction in both defense and in non-defense discretionary accounts will take effect January 2, 94 days into the government fiscal year. Without sufficient planning information, we have been unable to more precisely estimate the adverse impacts, and have petitioned the administration and the Congress to stop sequestration and replace it with a more constructive process, or if sequestration is to occur, provide the necessary planning information so we can properly and responsibly prepare to act. I'll be happy to cover these or any other topics in more detail during our discussion but first, let's turn to Chris for the operational report and Bruce for the financials. Chris?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Well, thanks, Bob. From an operating perspective, we had a very strong quarter in an uncertain and challenging environment. In the area of new business, we had several multiyear awards that allow us to offer innovative, relevant and affordable solutions to our customers. In Electronic Systems, the U.S. Navy awarded a 5-year, $1 billion contract to provide more than 200 digital cockpits and integrated systems and sensors for the new MH-60 Romeo and CR helicopters. The Navy will realize significant savings due to the multiyear contracting vehicle. In Information Systems & Global Solutions, our team continues to build upon their impressive string of competitive wins over the last 6 months. We were previously awarded the National Science Foundation NRT contract and the DoD Cyber Crime Center contract. This quarter, we won the Defense Information System Agency contract to manage the transformation of the DoD's global data network. IS&GS also achieved another milestone with its recognition as the top IT service provider to the federal government for the 18th consecutive year. Let me just now turn to some of our key operational achievements in the quarter. Electronic Systems delivered the second Littoral Combat Ship to Fort Worth. Our team successfully completed acceptance trials and delivered the ship to the U.S. Navy in June, 2 months ahead of schedule and under cost. Our LCS team achieved another important milestone when the Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey completed their review of our first ship, the USS Freedom, and declared the ship fit for duty. I just returned from Singapore, and there was much excitement and anticipation for the USS Freedom arriving next year where it will perform a key role in our new U.S. Defense strategy. Electronic Systems also continued to expand critical capabilities in the growing area of Missile Defense with intercepted targets by 2 of our systems. Our Aegis ballistic Missile Defense system successfully intercepted a target missile using the upgraded Aegis system for the first time. Additionally, our PAC-3 missile successfully intercepted and destroyed a cruise missile target, demonstrating the unique ability of the system to detect, track and destroy at extended range. Missile defense is a growing market internationally, and we are well positioned with our broad portfolio of Aegis, Patriot, MEADS and THAAD, along with the related command and control and battle management systems. In our Space Systems business, the second advanced VHF military communications satellites for the U.S. Air Force has launched, and we delivered 2 commercial Satellites in the quarter. Let me wrap up with the F-35 status. Overall, the program continues to gain momentum in developmental flight testing, production activities and international interest. Flight test on the development program are progressing at a solid pace. Year-to-date through June, test flights are significantly ahead of plan by 150 flights or 34%, and test points are also ahead of plan by over 900 points or 24%. Software development is another area of progress on the program. As we've mentioned on previous calls, software development is a critically important element of the F-35 program. We discussed some scheduled pressures during our last call, and I'm pleased to report that we are seeing improvements to the schedule. As a further sell-in to software maturity and deployment, we began flying the Block 2 A software on the first STOVL aircraft in June. This Block is now flying on CTOL and STOVL aircraft. Production activities are continuing to progress. In our second quarter, we delivered 3 production aircraft. Since then, we've delivered 7 additional aircraft, bringing year-to-date production deliveries to 12. Included in this total is the first international aircraft delivered to the United Kingdom. In the area of new production contracts, we were pleased with the award of $490 million for long lead on LRIP 7 this quarter. This authorization enables procurement activities to begin for 35 aircraft and add stability to the supplier base and production line. Internationally, the F-35 program continued to receive strong support. This quarter, Norway announced their initial order for 2 aircraft, which is expected to be followed by up to 50 additional aircraft. After the close of the quarter, Japan reaffirmed their intentions to purchase the F-35 and signed a letter of offer and acceptance to order 4 initial aircraft. Additionally, international new business opportunities continue to emerge on the F-35. This past quarter, we submitted a proposal to supply 60 aircraft to South Korea. The announcement of the winning aircraft is scheduled to occur before the end of the year. Overall, the program is demonstrating increasing maturity and tempo, and the global F-35 team looks forward to providing this critical asset to our nation and allies. With current aircraft deployment of 19 operational aircraft to Eglin Air Force Base, including the U.K. aircraft, plus 8 test aircraft at Patuxent Naval Air Station, 6 more test aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base and just over 70 aircraft in production flow, the F-35 program is making good progress. With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce to discuss our financials.
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 in an overview of the second quarter. We grew sales for the company by 3% versus the second quarter of 2011. I'll describe the drivers behind that growth on the next chart. Our segment operating profit margins improved by 60 basis points to 12.3%, and I'll also provide more color on that improvement in a couple of charts. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 10%, driven by the higher sales volume and margin improvement. We generated $845 million in cash from operations while contributing more than $600 million into our pension plans. This amount completes the $1.1 billion in required contributions for the year. And as you saw in our earnings release, we've increased our outlook for operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. On Chart 4, we'll look at sales by the 4 business areas. As in the first quarter, sales were slightly ahead of our expectations with 3 of our 4 business areas growing. Aeronautics grew 1% in the quarter led by additional quantities of F-16 deliveries. This growth was dampened by the labor strike in Fort Worth, particularly on the F-35 program. Electronic Systems had 2% growth in the quarter, driven by our Mission Systems & Sensors business unit, which had higher volume for our Persistent Threat Detection System or PTDS along with higher activity on our LCS and MH-60 programs. Space Systems had significant growth in the quarter driven by the delivery of 2 commercial Satellites versus none in the second quarter last year. We also had higher volume on the Orion program compared with last year. And finally, IS&GS declined by 4% driven mostly by a reduction in sales for the AMF JTRS program. As with the first quarter, IS&GS's sales reduction was less than we had expected, with continuing growth in our Intelligence line of business, particularly in federal cyber activity helping to lessen the decline. Chart 5 shows the segment margin levels for each of the 4 business areas. The primary reason for the overall margin increase to 12.3% was due to improvements in our Aeronautics and Electronic Systems business areas. I'd like to discuss these in a little more detail. Within Aeronautics, there were several factors that resulted in a 13.3% margin in the quarter that warrants additional discussion. First, we reduced our profit booking rate for the F-35 SDD contract from just over 4% to just under 4%, which yielded an inception-to-date $85 million reduction in profit in the quarter. While we had previously assumed a deck-oriented amount for the remaining fee would be earned, this adjustment reduces that amount even more. We made this adjustment as there's currently no plan in place for the government for how over $500 million of remaining fee can be earned, and we are nearing the point where the amount of profit recorded would exceed the amount of fees received to date on the contract. In addition, we've been disappointed recently with the amount of fee available to be earned for developmental milestones and the government's evaluations of our performance against those milestones compared with our own assessment. Importantly, because of where we are from percent complete basis on the development contract, the vast majority of the profit adjustment affects the current year. The lower rate has little incremental impact on future margins and earnings for Aeronautics. This SDD adjustment was substantially offset by contractual resolutions on other firms such as the F-22, leaving outstanding performance on our C-130 program, particularly on international contracts, as the principal reason for the improved margin performance in the quarter. And as Chris mentioned, we're pleased with our progress on the F-35 program as a whole. Looking at the margin for Electronic Systems, the story is similar to Aeronautics. Improved performance on a number of programs drove the higher margin as contractual resolutions offset proper rate reductions on a few programs and severance cost for workforce reductions at MS2. Within IS&GS, the higher margin results from a slight improvement in our Intelligence line of business across a number of contracts and the reduction in the margin in Space Systems primarily reflects lower equity earnings due to timing in the quarter. Higher earnings associated with risk retirements on the Orion program helped to partially offset the lower equity earnings. Turning to Chart 6 and earnings per share in the quarter, EPS from continuing operations grew 10% over the amount reported last year, and adjusting our reported EPS for the effects of the FAS/CAS adjustment increases our earnings per share to $2.77 per share. If you'll turn to Chart 7, you can see our operating cash flow performance in the quarter compared with last year. Adjusting for the higher pension contributions we made this year compared with last, our pre-pension cash flow was more than $1.4 billion. And after considering the strong performance during the first half of the year and our expectations for the rest of the year, we increased our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to greater than or equal to $3.9 billion for the year. On Chart 8, we'll discuss our updated guidance. We're maintaining our sales outlook, although we are updating 2 of the business areas within this guidance level as we'll discuss shortly. We increased segment operating profit by $125 million. We also increased our earnings per share, as I'll detail in the next chart and again, we increased our cash from operations by $100 million. Chart 9 shows our EPS outlook reconciliation. The segment operating profit increase added $0.25 to our outlook. Several items partially offset that increase, making the net increase to our annual EPS $0.20, resulting in a new range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. Chart 10 shows our sales outlook where we lowered Aeronautics by $200 million for the year, primarily reflecting the effects of the strike. About half of the reduction is for lower F-35 volume, and the other half is an expected slip of 3 F-16 aircraft out of 2012 into 2013. Offsetting this reduction is a $200 million increase in Space Systems, reflecting their strong performance year-to-date. Chart 11 shows our new segment operating profit guidance. Again, the total increase is $125 million with Aeronautics and Electronic Systems both increasing $50 million for the year, whilst Space Systems increased $25 million. And finally, we wrap up with our summary on Chart 12. We've had an excellent first half of the year, which reflects the strength of our portfolio and the affordability actions we've taken. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales will be about $1 billion lower than 2011 results, primarily due to decreases in Aeronautics and Space Systems. We expect segment operating margins to be comparable to last year's and cash from operations to exceed $1 billion. With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Bob, actually, a tactical near-term question and a second strategic question for you, if you don't mind. The Antideficiency Act precludes the government from spending more than Congress authorizes and many contracts are incrementally funded, which means 1 should start affecting 3 and 4Q results. To what extent does the 2012 guidance reflect this, and can you help us understand your key assumptions? Will you pay employees out of profits and assume retroactive authorization or does your guidance presume stoppage of many of your large contracts? And can you touch on which large contracts are most at risk under warrant?
Robert J. Stevens: That's a comprehensive question, Heidi. I think the details of your question highlight many of the specific details that have gone into our requests for additional guidance because there is considerable uncertainty in understanding exactly how sequestration would be implemented and how, for example, unobligated balances might be affected, how those unobligated balances might be applied contract line item by contract line item. Whether or not military personnel accounts will be excluded or included in the total amount to be sequestered because that has a fairly significant impact on the percentage reductions. So I think your question's front-running a little bit of the detail we have. I'm sure that our government customers are thinking about their responsibilities under the Antideficiency provisions, I think they understand that pretty well. And I think the final part of your question was which contracts, particularly the significant ones, might be most affected. And here again, I think the devil lies a little bit in the details of understanding exactly how the across-the-board reductions, perhaps net of funds flowing from unobligated balances versus new obligational authority subject to sequestration will impact our individual contracts. So, of course, we have significant portfolio areas. Chris mentioned Missile Defense, Chris mentioned the tactical aircraft portfolio, our airlift capability, our Space Systems programs. We think some of our classified activity likely will all be subject to sequester, and which programs will absorb what percent of the cost reduction is not yet clear to us.
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Heidi, I'll jump in on one comment. As Bob said in his opening remarks, we have contemplated or we are contemplating a continuing resolution in the fourth quarter of this year, and I'll say that affects our business areas differently depending on sort of where they are in the life cycle. The one is -- the most impacted is IS&GS typically because it's the shorter cycle business that we have. So I would say we're probably a little cautious perhaps in the guidance that we're giving, considering the fact that we do believe that continuing resolution is likely going to happen in that fourth quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Bruce, I was just wondering if we could talk a little bit about cash and maybe start off with some comments around FAS/CAS and harmonization of that system. I know that starting back in February, you were able to begin raising your rates and including FAS/CAS harmonization going forward. I'm just wondering how that process is going and whether the outlook that you've talked about in the past and the impact that FAS/CAS will have on you going forward, what that kind of looks like. And then just on the cash topic, the use this quarter on the share repurchase somewhat has you pacing below the $1 billion that you've talked about targeting for repurchases. Can you just give us an update on that as well?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, sure, Jason. So as far as sort of a current status of how FAS/CAS is going and is it tracking to what we talked about in the past, I would say yes, it is. That law, I think, was signed February 27 of this year. We've already negotiated across the corporation, a number of what we call our forward pricing right agreements that have the effects of CAS harmonization included in them. So I'll say that is sort of a business as usual at this point right now. You've seen -- as we've all seen the effects of lower interest rate through the first half of this year, they're definitely lower probably than where we were at the end of last year. Of course, we don't set those rates until the end of this year, but if we were to set them today, they'd be lower than where we were last year. Our asset returns, I think, are doing actually fairly comparable to what our expectations were. The one thing I think that's changed, Jason, that's important to consider not necessarily this year but in future years is the transportation -- or excuse me, the highway bill that was passed recently, which had a consideration for reducing some of the funding required by ERISA. And that has the effect of lowering the requirements for our ERISA contributions beginning next year. The modeling of that's a little complicated. I won't get into it, but basically think of a band of around the sort of a 25-year average of interest rates. And if you're outside that, if your current interest rate or discount rate is outside of that band and you used the 25-year average, we're definitely outside of that band as we go into 2013, and so we'll use that 25-year average, which is a much higher rate than what we're currently experiencing. That has the effect of -- I think I tried to tee up on the call in the first quarter that we've had ERISA required contributions of more than $2 billion going into next year compared to $1.1 billion this year. That change in the funding consideration change including the highway transportation bill would lower the required contribution to about the level comparable to what we're seeing this year. So somewhere in the 1.1-ish range or maybe a little flexibility there because we haven't quite seen the final rates come out of that yet, so there may be a little bit of play but not much, I would guess. And so this is as we get bigger hits sort of from negative events due to the size of our pension plan, we also get bigger benefits when there are positive events as well. I'll remind you also that the pension, reduced pension brings with it a reduced tax deduction as well. So you shouldn't think of the $1 billion as being a pure cash because there will be less tax deduction associated with that $1 billion less. You also asked about share repurchases, and we are a little bit light to the first half of the year. We've made no change in our commitment to the $1 billion outlook, and I won't expect to make a change between now and at the year end then.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Bob, you seem to have taken a sort of leadership role for the industry in your comments that you've made publicly about sequestration. I'm wondering what sorts of conversations you've been having with Congress about potential possible outcomes and time lines? And I'm wondering if you can sense any sort of incremental change in language or posture recently that you -- that's detectable or have we made no progress over the last quarter?
Robert J. Stevens: Well, thanks for the question, Carter. I know that many in the industry are experiencing exactly what we are right now, Carter, and that, I think, is best characterized by a huge amount of uncertainty for a long-cycle business like ours to be unable to see 6 months into the future for a pretty dramatic reduction of resources available to our customers, a significant and for us unprecedented. Throughout industry, I think that reaction is similar. I will say the awareness about the more detailed aspects of sequestration, I believe, is growing and has grown. And it's important to remember the sequestration is not just a reduction in discretionary defense accounts. It's also a reduction in non-defense discretionary accounts, which affect lots of civil government agencies. So I believe we're hearing more detailed descriptions from agency heads and leaders in the government about the potential adverse impacts in their ability to meet their mission responsibilities or fulfill their commitments under sequestration. For our part, we are trying to model internally but to be very candid with you, that model is filled much more with our assumptions about what might happen than any detail specifically given to us about what will happen. The facts are sequestration is the law. It goes into effect January 2. It requires $55 billion in each of defense and nondiscretionary -- nondefense discretionary accounts. Beyond that, we're still struggling with exactly how this will impact our business. We are very concerned about the supply chain, particularly small disadvantaged minority-owned businesses. That's what we regard as the edge of that supply chain. I know we're having discussions here about what kind of business we'll have if we are compelled to implement sequestration. I think they're asking if they'll even have a business, will they have an enterprise. So I think there are significant shocks to the industrial base and very honestly, we simply try to describe them to our best professional capacity, not to incite any particular level of over concern, but we are very, very concerned about the across-the-board nature with an automatic trigger, and that's what we've tried to voice.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.
Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Just a question on book to bill. So it was about 0.9x, a bit less than the 1x, but still an improvement versus first quarter. I just want to gauge the confidence in finishing the year with book to bill of about 1x, maybe highlight some of the contracts you're expecting to book in the second half. Now also, did I hear say that you thought South Korea would be booked by year end, and is that one of the things that's giving you the confidence?
Bruce L. Tanner: Rich, it's Bruce, I'll take that one. Your assessment of where we are in the second quarter relative to orders is correct. And I'll say probably what's not as apparent in just the absolute numbers reported is we are actually ahead of where we thought we'd be at the second quarter this time. I tried to tee up on the first call that we thought the second quarter would be down a little lower than normal. The results might lead you to believe that that's the case, but that's actually a little better than we expected it to be. We also mentioned that we thought the third quarter would be a higher rebound than we historically have in years past, and we still think that'll be the case. You asked about some of the -- what are the contracts we're looking for. Most of them, frankly, are in the category of what I'll call follow-on contracts or contracts to be left with the new fiscal year. So yes, the ones I'm watching to close between now in the second and the end of this year are the F-35, our 5 contract, getting additional funding in the form of undefinitized contractual action or other means on the LRIP 6 contract. We'd like to close the THAAD, the combined buy of THAAD missiles from the U.S. government as well as the UAE. And we've got a whole slew of new fiscal year contracts that usually pop up in the fourth quarter. Think of that as the fleet ballistic missile and the PAC-3 contracts that'll play there. I think, was there a second part of the question there?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Rich, this is Chris. I mentioned South Korea is a competition for the F-35. We were told the down select would be at the end of the year, but the actual contract would be in the latter part of 2013 at the earliest. So that would not be in our orders of backlog in 2012.
Bruce L. Tanner: And, Rich, I don't think I answered kind of the last part of your question, which was what's the confidence level we have for sort of ending the year at a 1.0. I still think as we sit here today, even with all the caveats that we did relative to sequestration and so forth, we've got a fairly good chance of achieving the same level of backlog at the end of this year as we started the beginning of this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I'd like to dive a little bit into the -- some of the details on the F-35 contract profit accrual rates. And so, Bruce, you gave a good description of what's going on with SDD. I just want to confirm that essentially, what you're assuming now is that your future fees will be about 4% of future revenues because you're pretty much at a crossover point right now where that's sure looking backward. And then more importantly, over on the LRIP side, which contracts drove the $20 million risk retirement? And where do we stand on specifically on LRIP 5?
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, Joe, for the question. I think you had assessed pretty right. The changes that we talked about, I think it's important to note and obviously you understand that very clearly. This is only affecting the development contract. The production firms aren't impacted by that. The production programs typically don't have much, if any, award fee. They're typically kind of cost performance driven, and so that's also different than the rate or the change that we've talked about for the F-35 SDD contract. I made a comment that we were booking higher than 4%, to a little bit higher than 4% going into this quarter. We came out a little lower than 4%, and that's the adjustment that does bring our booked profit down, if you will, below the amount of earned fee that we have at this point in time. The 2 programs on the production side where we had some performance improvements or booking rate increases this quarter were both Lot 3 and Lot 5. And I think as we progress throughout the year, I think I made the comment either last quarter or the quarter before about the number of deliveries, and Chris highlighted that as well in his prepared remarks, and we're going to finalize deliveries of all the LRIP 2 aircraft, all the LRIP 3 and a pretty good portion of LRIP 4 aircraft this year. So typically, as with most production programs, that will give you that the -- give us, excuse me, the opportunity to assess our performance on that and see if it's coming in line with our expectations and enables additional risk retirements. I think there was one other part of your question there, Joe. I've lost track of what it is, to be honest with you, so I'll go on to the next caller.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I wanted to get your thoughts on cost reduction. It's something that you've emphasized quite a bit over the last 6 to 9 months. Can you talk about what you're doing in that area, whether it's overhead reduction, supply chain facilities? And are there certain targets you have and certain progress against those? In other words, is there any way to quantify the kinds of actions you're taking?
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Yes, Doug, this is Chris. Thanks for the question. We've been focused on the affordability for the last several years, and it really is all encompassing. Let me start with the employees and the leadership team. If you go back a little over 1 year ago, we had our Voluntary Executive Separation Program where 26% of the leadership team was reduced, and that was over 600 people. Of course, there's the flow down impact of that. We're looking at the layers, we're looking at the span of control as it relates to the personnel and the organizational structure. And we're continuing to look at how best to organize. And you'll recall a couple of years ago, we exited the Eagan, Minnesota facility, we consolidated Owego onto MS2, all those things are on the table. We've focused quite a bit on facilities and our actual footprint. We've taken out over 1.5 million square feet of our facilities, both owned and leased. We have another 2.9 million to go that we've identified and obviously, if there were further cuts to the budget, there could be significantly more reductions. And the supply chain you mentioned, clearly that's an area that we focused both internally with category management as we call it, consolidating our suppliers and holding them accountable for the quality and timely delivery. So I see some of these as being shorter term, some midterm and then, of course, we're always looking out on the long term. And you know back in '06, we placed our defined benefit pension plan with defined contribution pension plan. And that will, I think, position us well for the long term. So that's just kind of an overview of what we're doing. I think when I last looked, you can easily calculate several billion dollars of reduction that we benefited from and that we passed on to our customers as a result of these actions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Question, I guess either Bob or Chris, really want to focus on Information Systems and -- or IS&GS. Just regarding we've seen the most erosion there in terms of the backlog, and I get it regarding being impacted by the CR. But I guess following up on Doug's question in terms of your ability to reduce costs and preserve margins there, you've done a nice job at net 9%, but we're still seeing that's the only segment that's not growing. Can you give us a little more color on that? We're hearing about a lot of predatory practices amongst your peers in terms of bidding contracts pretty aggressively about preserving those margins.
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Yes, Peter, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. I guess we were very satisfied with our margins in IS&GS this quarter, and we seem to have been able to maintain at or around 9%. Relative to top line growth, you're right. We are experiencing some decline there. It's not unexpected for the reasons that Bob and Bruce mentioned and you suggested in your question. We will continue to bid what we think are appropriate business cases for our business. And I must say we've been very successful on winning some significant opportunities of late. And the protesting is continuing, probably more so than the predatory bidding practices. So I think we have 3 major wins currently under review that we had previously win. So our strategy is to win all the business we can at the appropriate returns. We'll let the 100-day protest cycle run out, and then we will move forward. So I have very high confidence in our ability to execute on these programs. We're hitting all of our milestones. But as I look forward to additional growth opportunity, we're really focused on Cyber Security, and I mentioned that we won the -- what was referred to as the DC3 contract. That was the largest Department of Defense cyber contract awarded to date. We have numerous engagements with Fortune 100 corporations, and we're also continuing to look in health care, IT and the energy lines of business as additional growth areas. So I think we have a good strategy. We're executing on it, and I'm optimistic that we'll find a way to grow over the long haul.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess this is probably a question for Bruce. You obviously benefited from a significant amount of positive contract adjustments in the quarter. Could you talk about what the guidance for the year assumes for positive adjustments, and which business areas have the biggest opportunity for positive adjustments moving forward?
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, David. I think I said at the start, I lose track which quarter I made these comments on, but I think I said in the first quarter that we were looking at 2012 to have maybe comparable levels of performance improvements as what we saw in 2011. And we actually saw a pretty big increase in those performance improvements mostly coming in Electronic Systems in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we had some good performance, both particularly in Aeronautics and Electronic Systems, also Space Systems on the Orion program, as well as the contractual resolutions that we mentioned that also caused us to come in higher than what we've started at the beginning of the year or expected at the beginning of the year. Our expectations for the second half of the year are probably to be down a little bit compared to the second half of 2011. But again, as we get into the quarter and we actually do our assessments of where we stand on program performance, that's when we would have unexpected both performance improvements, as well as potential reductions in profits rates. But from a planning perspective, as we sit here today, we expect it to be a little lighter in the second half of the year compared to 2011 and by definition, lighter in the second half this year compared to the first half of this year.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Bruce, just a quick follow-up on the pension. I think previously, you said you expected the FAS/CAS charge next year to be roughly half what you're booking this year. Has that situation changed given the moving metrics of contributions, interest rates and the new legislation on ERISA contributions?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes. We're probably about 6 months before I'd like to have this conversation, Rob, but definitely, as I said earlier, interest rates are down. If I was to put a number on it, they're probably down about 75 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Your guess is probably better than mine at this point as to what they will have or what they will do between now and the end of the year. You're right on the quantification I've given in the past, all that assumes, as I'd like to call it sort of current course and speed with the same level of discount rate as we ended last year and an 8% return on assets. Again, as I mentioned in the earlier remarks, I think our asset returns are actually holding pretty steady to that level. But the discount rate, if we were to pick it today, would be lower than what it was the end of the year. That would have the tendency to increase FAS, which would make a smaller drop. I still believe it would be a drop at this point from the FAS/CAS adjustment from 2012 to '13. There'd be a lesser drop.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Bruce, if I take a look at the guidance you have for the second half of the year, you're assuming maybe flattish revenues with the first half and a 10.9% or so margin. I guess that's consistent with David's question about what's embedded in the second half of the year for ECAs. But my question is if you go back to last year and your prior years, it's highly unusual for the second half to have a much lower margin than the first half and yes, that's what's being projected. So is there something else that's in there besides the comment about assuming no incremental ECAs?
Bruce L. Tanner: George, let me try to address a couple of things I think embedded in your question. One is just the second half versus the first half in general, and then I'll hit on the margins especially. Yes, I've taken a look at where we sit today and what our expectations are relative to the guidance we provided for the second half versus where we sit today. There's a couple of things that happened in the first half of the year that won't repeat from a revenue side in the second half of the year. The first of those is again, we had 2 commercial Satellites in the first half of the year, and we're expecting no commercial Satellites in the second half. Think of that as probably a little less than $300 million or so that won't be repeated. Within Electronic Systems, all 29 of the Persistent Threat Detection Systems or PTDS systems that were under contract actually delivered in the first half. So that contract is essentially finished, there will be no PTDS deliveries in the second half. Think of that also as in the $300 million range. So there's sort of $600 million of pressure going from the first half to the second half of the year. We also have in the second half, probably 9 to 10 fewer F-16 deliveries, second half of the year again versus first half. But that's probably offset in large part, maybe even more so, because we expect to have 4 to 5 more C-5 deliveries in the second half than the one we've had in the first half. So those kind of pushed probably. I think as I look at say, the year, it's easier to understand if you sort of do a sequential quarter-to-quarter, it's easier to understand that. So we did roughly $23 billion of revenue in the first half. And I think if you just went to the midpoint in the guidance, it's 45 5. So you can say if you just double the 23, we're pretty close to the 45 5, but for those 2 items I mentioned previously. I think the issue is that the comparison with the second half for 2011 is a tough comparison. Both the third and fourth quarter of last year were much higher than the first and second quarter of last year. And just for example, we did $22 billion roughly in the sales in the first half. We did $24.5 billion roughly in the second half. So obviously, we tremendously outperformed the second half relative to the first half whereas 2012, as I said before, is going to be a little lighter in the second half. I also said we might be a little bit conservative as we sit here today with the expected continuing resolution in the fourth quarter and the prospects of a sequestration on January 2, but we'll see if that actually changes and we'll update accordingly. Relative to the margins, George, you said we don't have a tendency to have a lower second half than the first half, and I'll tell you that's -- we'll still try to make that come true. But we've had, again, just taking a look at the increased profit rate adjustments, as well as the contractual resolutions that we had happen in the first half of the year, our expectations as we sit here today is that those won't replicate at the same level for the same reason I told David in the second half. And that's what will drive margins. Again, maybe a little bit conservative on the top side, it would drive some EBIT, but I don't know if the margins will change all that much from the second half of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit just about something around the cash flow, which was around the continuing resolution last year? You certainly moved to build cash levels and seeing the buyback activity weakened, I guess the first piece is are you doing that now? And second piece is does that have any implications for how we should be thinking about the dividend decision that the board typically takes in September where the last few years, we've certainly seen an acceleration from 10% growth to 20% to 30%? How should we be thinking about the appetite for an increase this year going into potentially sequestration and continuing resolution?
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, Sam, this is Bruce. I'll try that, and Chris or Bob can pile on if they want to. I think as far as cash balances are concerned, we probably are going into the second half of the year with a little higher cash balance than we might otherwise have expected. And I think we're trying to be mindful of what could happen under both the continuing resolution, as well as the potential CR. And again, our position is we don't want to induce behaviors that would cause program performance issues, cost growth, if we can avoid those perhaps with some balance sheet help. And so we're mindful of that. And again, I think we want to have the flexibility in order to accommodate that. We don't see, as I said earlier, I don't see us backing off the $1 billion share repurchase. That's still our plan and goal for the year. Even though we were a little bit lighter in the second quarter, I still think we're going to achieve that $1 billion number. You asked about the dividends in September. We revisit that every year with our Board of Directors. We've had some preliminary conversations with them, but that's a decision that we'll make in consultation with our board members, and I'd be premature to have that discussion with you right now.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Bruce, on ES, you talked about some of the things that benefited the first half, but that looks like the segment that does retract the most in the second half. Is it -- are you being a little conservative there? And then the other thing I was going to ask is really where I think Joe was going before is just the latest on LRIP 5.
Bruce L. Tanner: I knew I missed that one, I'll catch that one on this one, Rob, and I apologize for Joe. I realized after I went to the next speaker that I missed that one. So ES, second half, again the ES, Electronic Systems is where we have the PTDS. Again, we've got about a $300 million headwind because all those units delivered, as I've said earlier, in the first half. I'd like to think, Rob, that we have a chance to do a little better there. That's yet to play out, and we'll watch that closely. I'll say I've been pleasantly surprised by the performance of Electronic Systems in both the first quarter and the second quarter. Electronic Systems historically and going into the future years always has had our highest international content. I think that there's some still substantial international awards this year that could help us with the sales growth in the second half of the year. But those, as usual, are a little harder to predict at this point in time. So are we conservative? I hope so, Rob, and we'll see as that plays out in the second half of the year. LRIP 5 negotiations, again, I apologize, Joe. We're continuing the process. It is a long process. We've been at it now for at least 1.5 years. So I'll say I think we're making slow and steady progress. I think both sides have a desire to get this closed and to get this closed in the not-too-distant future, and we're clearly on that page that we'd like to do as well. I think we will close in a manner that's beneficial to both parties in the not-too-distant future.
Robert J. Stevens: I'll just add on, on the international front and whether these orders get closed this year or 2013. I personally just got back from a 2-week trip in Marilyn Hewson and all our execs have been increasing their international travel to the Far East and the Mid East. And there is definitely a concern relative to threat environment, and I believe our portfolio and the interest they have in our fighter aircraft, whether it's the F-35 or the F-16, the C-130 everybody loves and of course, our Missile Defense and command and control systems, there is a big appetite out there based on the portfolio that we have. And I believe we have the experience and the know-how and the relationships to do business internationally and to grow. And when they hit the books is to be determined, but I can assure you there's a lot of interest and it's a focus of ours going forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So, Bruce, could you quantify how big were the cume CAS estimate changes in total in the second quarter, and kind of what are you looking for, for the full year? And then the notional question that you've been at this 30% more or less level for so long, is that sustainable in 2013 and '14 in this current environment?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes. So, Cai, I think, and I'll stick with what we have in the release, which says we had about $160 million, $170 million in improvement in our profit rate adjustments this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year and again, several performance improvements that I elaborated on already across all 4 business areas, but maybe just to reiterate, C-130 international programs, we had, as you might expect because of the end of the PTDS contract, we recognized some performance improvements on that. We also had nice performance on our vertical launch system. On Electronic Systems, we had, as I mentioned earlier, performance improvement because of a risk retirement for a developmental milestone associated with the Orion crew exploration vehicle. And then on top of that, we had, again I'll say an unusually high level of contractual resolutions that resolved this quarter. And so that's the one that is making the numbers probably a little higher than last year’s second quarter. As far as sustainability, you mentioned the 30%. I still think that we're able to maintain that level. If you look back at our history, Cai, we've done that every year. And I look at it again from sort of what is in our planning going forward in terms of planned risk retirements, planned profit rate increases, and I'll say they approach that level today. And where we differ from that level is when we have unplanned beneficial improvements above what we already had considered or when it goes the other way and we have a negative or a decremented proper rate adjustment. Thankfully this year, we've had few of those. Those were offset, again, primarily by the contractual resolutions and were less with the overall performance improvements. So I still see that trend is what was going to happen the latter half of this year and going into 2013 and for that matter, beyond as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: You commented in the release that it would take up the contributions into the second half. Bruce, can you talk about what that's going to look like sequentially into the second half? And also, is that a headwind into 2013? And then to squeeze another one in, the pullback in rates, the disconnect now that exists between CAS and ERISA and FAS, do you think mark-to-market approach on pension expense is making more sense given all the changes that have happened over the last 6 months?
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, Cai. You got both ends of the spectrum with your question there. I'd like to try to address -- I'm sorry, did I say -- it's Myles, I'm sorry. Excuse me, Myles. Sorry about that. So yes, I didn't try to write some comments in my prepared remarks about the ULA and USA relative to the equity earnings that we're expecting. We had a little over -- equity earnings in the second quarter, as I said, mostly because of timing issues. And it was actually a nice performance improvement out of our ULA operation last quarter that wasn't replicated this quarter, which made that comparison year-over-year a little more difficult. But this quarter had just lower earnings based on the launch vehicles and the like in the second quarter. We do expect a fairly significantly higher second half of the year relative to equity earnings. Most of that coming in the third quarter. You didn't mention USA, but we're also expecting sort of with the closeout of the United Space Alliance activity to have an additional improvement relative to that equity earnings higher than we've experienced in the first half of this year. So both of those are going to cause, I'll say, a little spike in the third quarter and then will come back down in the fourth quarter, but again, collectively higher in the second half than the first half. You asked about going forward, and I'll say we lose that spike relative to the USA going into 2013 and beyond. But what we're seeing within the Space Systems, Cai, and I've said this on a couple of occasions, is we're getting finished with a number of developmental parts of programs such as the MUOS contract, the SBIRS contract and some others. And we're getting into sort of the sweet spot of production vehicles for all those, and we're doing very well on those. And that performance on the production coming out of the development, as you can expect, the margin improvements associated with that are helping to mitigate the downward pressure resulting from the lower equity earnings next year such that I don't expect a large change in the margins to occur because of that lower equity amount. CAS and ERISA and a lot of moving pieces as you described there in mark-to-market, yes, we've looked at that multiple times. And I'm not sure -- this is why I think I keep preaching that you've got to look through the accounting and get to the economics of it. And frankly, I’d personally favor sort of we all got on the same page there, but I don't know that I see a change on the horizon for us to get to mark-to-market as a company.
Jerry F. Kircher: Karen, this is Jerry. I think we'll come up on the hour. Maybe one more question in queue.
Operator: Our final question for today comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Sort of related to what you've talked about in Space and then in one other thing. In Space, you made some management reorganizations, if you could address what that does also in terms of taking out cost? And then can you reconcile -- Bob, you alluded to it that you've had some great performance metrics on the F-35 and yet you're not getting, I guess, compensated for it.
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Okay, Howard, it's Chris. Let me take the Space question. As I mentioned in an earlier answer, we are constantly looking at our organizational structure and looking how best to streamline and consolidate and get synergies both from a revenue and a cost side. What we basically did there was flatten the organization. And I think we went from about 7 or 8 lines of business directly reporting in to our EVP to 4 or 5. The goal there was to reduce the overhead and the infrastructure to support the businesses. And we also appointed a deputy, Rick Ambrose, a longtime executive with the corporation, to help Joanne as we focus on the strategy and the execution. So the overall goal there was better alignment with the customer and cost savings. And I guess I'll turn it over to Bob here for the F-35 and the wrap-up.
Robert J. Stevens: Yes. Thanks, Chris and Howard, thanks for the question. So relative to the F-35 and our earning potential, we all recognize and you all recognize this is a complex demanding program, really a one-of-a-kind type program that's unfolding in an increasingly tough environment. So we're held to very high standards, and we expect to be held to high standards. We look back at the 18 -- last 18 months performance and found it to be good. We're ahead of our planning. I think we're beating our March, there's much more to go. So we're very realistic about the overall performance. Bruce's comments about the system design and development phase, I think, reflect the reality that we're looking at. But increasingly, our earnings potential will be defined by our ability to produce and deliver the production aircraft lot over lot. And we're very focused on achieving that goal because that's what's going to give our customers the forestructure and the capacity that they need and they expect from us. And so all of us are very focused on the entire F-35 program. We've tried to give the best balanced assessment and accounting of how we expect to earn profit. I will tell you we do expect to earn profit. We think when we deliver high-quality products, that is an appropriate economic response, so that we can share in the value of that performance with the investors in the company. So for all of us, we thank you for your time on the call today. We appreciate the questions; thought they were challenging and good and really insightful about our business. I'll tell you we're all very pleased that the company's remained strong and focused in a really challenging environment. We think that's great credit to the women and men who work here. They exhibit great dedication on a daily basis, and we're grateful to them. We have a really strong portfolio. Chris mentioned his international travel along with our other executives, where we believe we're well-aligned with both global and domestic defense and security priorities. Our backlog, our cash resources, the financial strength of our company provide, we think, a degree of certainty in an uncertain environment as we look to deliver increasing value to shareholders and to customers, and we'll stay very focused on high levels of discipline. And as Bruce said, we'll update you as soon as we possibly can as to these changes in our environment and what they might mean to us. So, Karen, thank you for your help on the call today. Thank you, all, for participating and we'll sign off here.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Robert J. Stevens: Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. By now, you've had an opportunity to review 2 releases from us today, one describing our first quarter performance and one describing the discussion I've had with our board regarding my retirement and our leadership transition plan. I'll start with the latter. I'm very pleased to announce that our board has elected Chris Kubasik to be our next Chief Executive Officer and Marillyn Hewson to be our next President and Chief Operating Officer, with both appointments effective January 1, 2013. To assure a smooth and seamless transition, I'll continue to serve as CEO through the remainder of 2012 and, with shareholder and board approval, will serve as Chairman of the Board through January 2014. Chris and Marillyn, along with Bruce and many others, have been full partners for many years in evolving our strategies and our operating concepts to deliver superior value to customers and sustain value to shareholders. Together, we have built a great leadership team with bench strength, an excellent workforce, a sound strategy, solid portfolio and an operational momentum upon which to build value. I'm very proud of them and all that they've accomplished. And I'm confident there'll be much more to come. Let me anticipate at least one of your questions today. Why make this decision now? Well, I must tell you, I love what I do here. I believe in our mission, our values, our purpose, our people, our customers. Just having the opportunity to contribute at this level is such a privilege. I'm grateful to our board, and I'm grateful to our employees for the chance and for the support. It would be great if it could go on forever, but there are realities. I'll be 61 years old in September, and 62.5 when the transition plan I've described is complete. We have a mandatory retirement age here at 65. By the end of this year, I will have served as our CEO for more than 8 years, as President and Chief Operating Officer for about 4 years before that and as Chief Financial Officer before that. By any measure, that's a full period of service. When I assessed the complexities in the global security and economic environments, that new reality we've talked so much about, with the increasing velocity and volatility of global events that will shape our decision-making over many years, certainly, beyond my mandatory retirement age, I wanted to assure that we have a tested and trusted senior leadership team in place who can provide continuity and evolve our strategies over the longer term. We have that team in place now, ready to go, and you know them well. I've also studied leadership transition environments and have made my own assessments about what approaches are most successful and what works best. Let me give you 3 thoughts here. First, I believe longer-cycle transitions that assure a more complete transfer of responsibility are more effective than shorter ones, particularly for complex long cycle businesses like ours. Announcing our transition in April 2012 with an effective date in January 2013 gives us 8 months to focus on transition. And as I mentioned, with the support of our shareholders and the board, I'll remain as Chairman for another year through January 2014. Second, I think it's very healthy to draw highly qualified successors from inside the company, essentially a grow-your-own philosophy. We have an exceptionally productive talent management, leadership development and succession planning process that has had full board involvement over many years. And both Chris and Marillyn have had a series of very successful rotational assignments that have demonstrated their talent and their ability. And third, I believe transitions are more successful when the company is strong, and we are strong in every sense. Leadership, people, culture, financial flexibility, strategy, portfolio, all in place, which led to the performance that we saw in 2011 and that which we're reporting on the first quarter of 2012. That is not to say that there is not more work to do, because there is. But there is always more work to do. That's why we've committed ourselves to a philosophy of continuous improvement. Every generation of leaders has their challenges. Probably the one constant of executive life is that there will be challenges. Our leaders are up to the task. Chris is on the call with us today. Congratulations, Chris.
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Well, thanks, Bob, and I'm grateful to you and the other members of our board for your confidence in my ability to lead this great company, which has a 100-year history of protecting Americans and allies around the world. We work with the best team in the industry everyday, and I will build upon the foundation we've created to carry out our mission to support our customers. I want to assure everyone we'll remain focused on meeting our strategic, operational and financial commitments; on growing our business profitably; on innovating relevant new technologies; on further engaging our employees; and on returning value to investors. I've worked closely with Marillyn for almost 15 years, and I look forward to partnering with her in our new roles. Her 29 years with Lockheed Martin and experience in 3 business areas in corporate headquarters have given her unique insights in executing our strategy and sustaining our emphasis on operational excellence and affordability. I'm confident the transition will be seamless and successful, and I look forward to reporting our progress along the way. Again, Bob, thanks to you and the board for this opportunity. I'll turn it back to you.
Robert J. Stevens: Thanks, Chris. Again, congratulations to you, and congratulations to Marillyn. Let me turn to a very brief summary of the first quarter because we do want to get on to Bruce, and we want to move on to your questions. I see the quarter as a strong start to 2012 and a continuation of the execution momentum we demonstrated last year. We grew sales by 6%, earnings from continuing operations by 20% and earnings per share by 29%. Solid program execution and effective risk reduction coupled with ongoing cost-reduction initiatives lifted segment operating margins to 11.9% in the quarter, up from 11% the prior year. Cash generation was $458 million after making planned pension contributions of $505 million. Our cash deployment to shareholders in the quarter totaled $569 million, reflecting payments of $327 million in dividends and share repurchases of $242 million for the retirement of 2.7 million shares. These results reflect the strength of our corporation and the quality and dedication of our workforce that I referred to earlier. Thanks to everyone in the company for the hard work. Some uncertainty was relieved in the quarter with the delivery of the president's FY '13 budget request to Congress on February 6. The proposed defense budget outlines a base budget of $525 billion, with an overseas contingency operation budget of $88 billion. This budget reflects the new national security strategy outlined by the president and the secretary of defense. And the priorities within the budget generally align with our portfolio and our experience. The Department of Defense remains on a course to reduce spending by $487 billion over the next 10 years in accordance with the requirements of the Budget Control Act, but there's been no meaningful movement on sequestration. I believe our views in opposition to the sequestration process are clear, and we'll continue to work to stop this action. At the same time, we continue to work on affordability projects. From 2010 to 2011, we've lowered our overhead costs as reflected in our forward pricing rate proposals submitted to customers by almost $1.2 billion. Over the same period, we've removed 1.5 million square feet from facilities, and we're projecting the removal of an additional 2.9 million square feet through 2014. Beyond facilities reductions, we have also had to implement painful employee reductions. Since 2008, the net reduction of our total workforce stands at about 18%, with 26% of those reductions in leadership positions. Business conditions and competitive pressures require us to continue to evaluate staffing levels and were the catalysts for the recently announced layoff of an additional 500 employees within our MS2 business. Finally, let me turn to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Year-to-date, performance in the flight test program is ahead of plan. On the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft, we are slightly ahead of plan for both the number of flights conducted and the number of test points earned. On the short takeoff and vertical landing aircraft, we are ahead of plan by about 60% on flights and about 22% on test points earned. And on the carrier variant, we're also ahead of plan by about 31% on flights and 32% on test points earned. Contract negotiations continue on the Lot 5 program, with ongoing discussions between the customer and our F-35 team. We received our first counter offer from the government yesterday, and that's currently under evaluation. And we look forward to finalizing negotiations in the second quarter. We were pleased with the recent decision by the U.S. government to add 2 additional aircraft to Lot 5, bringing the revised procurement quantity to 32 aircraft. Also, at midnight last Sunday, about 3,600 members of the International Association of Machinists Union in Fort Worth, Texas rejected our best and final offer and are on strike. The offer that we advanced was fair and competitive and balanced the interest of employees, the company and our customers as we seek to position our business to meet today's affordability challenges and win new business in the future. For current Fort Worth Machinists Union employees, our offer included increases in wages, pension contributions, annual cost-of-living supplements and adjustments and a ratification bonus, but also sought to convert the defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan for new hires that would join our workforce in the future. This position of moving from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan for new employees has been applied consistently across our company for some time now since 2006, and I'm confident it's the right approach to meet the demands of our business. Our operations will remain open, and we'll implement our contingency plan while focusing on meeting our commitments to our customers. Now I'll have Bruce go through some of the details of the quarter, and then we'll open up the line for questions. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of the first quarter. We grew sales for the company by 6% over the -- our first quarter -- excuse me, our 2011 first quarter level. This growth was slightly better than expected, and I'll describe the drivers behind that growth on the next chart. Our segment operating profit margins improved by 90 basis points to 11.9%, and I'll also provide more color on that improvement in a couple of charts. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 29%, driven by the higher sales volume, the margin improvement, as well as the lower share count compared with this time last year. We generated approximately $460 million in cash from operations while making some expected payments that we discussed during the last call, including over $500 million of pension contributions made this quarter. As a result of our performance to begin the year, we increased our segment operating profit outlook by $50 million. On Chart 4, we'll look at our sales by the 4 business areas. Sales for the company were slightly ahead of our expectations, with 3 of our 4 business areas growing in the quarter. Aeronautics led this growth with an 18% increase, driven primarily by accelerated and higher quantities of both C-130 and F-16 aircraft deliveries and the higher F-35 production volume. Electronic Systems had 4% growth in the quarter, led by our Mission Systems & Sensors and Missiles and Fire Control business units. Space Systems started the year with a 2% increase in sales for the quarter, consistent with our expectations. And IS&GS declined by 3%, driven mostly by a reduction in sales for the AMF JTRS program. But this overall reduction was less significant than we had expected, with growth in our Intelligence line of business helping to mitigate the JTRS decline. Chart 5 shows the segment margin levels for each of the 4 business areas. As you can see, most of the margin improvement that led to the company's 11.9% level was driven by Electronic Systems. This improvement was driven primarily by outstanding performance at our Missiles and Fire Control business unit across a large group of programs and also reflected the acceleration of a number of performance milestones and contractual actions that were expected to occur later in the year. The net of this performance and acceleration led us to increase the guidance for Electronic Systems' operating profit by $50 million for the year. Turning to Chart 6 and our earnings per share in the quarter. EPS from continuing operations grew 29% over $1.57 per share we reported a year ago, again driven by the higher sales volume, margin improvement and lower share count. And our pension adjusted EPS at $2.41 grew by a strong 22% over last year. Moving to Chart 7, you can see our updated outlook for the year. We're maintaining our sales outlook as most of the first quarter growth reflect the timing of deliveries and not an increase in the total deliveries for the year. Our segment profit outlook is $50 million higher than we provided in January as we just discussed. However, our earnings per share from continuing operations remains at $7.70 to $7.90 as a result of changes in several non-operational items. I'll discuss this further on the next chart. Finally, with the additional segment operating profit for the year, we believe that our cash from operations will be at least $3.8 billion. On Chart 8, we'll discuss our earnings per share outlook of $7.70 to $7.90. This outlook recognizes the $50 million increase in segment operating profit worth $0.10 per share, and this offsets non-operational items of an equal amount. The first of these items is a net increase in unallocated expenses reflecting the change in our post-retirement benefit asset and liability levels, along with an increase in several corporate expense items, including our environmental remediation liabilities. In addition to these non-operational cost increases, our expected average share count for calculating EPS increased due to both the higher-than-planned level of options exercised in the quarter and an increase in share price, resulting in less share count reduction for the planned $1 billion of share repurchases. Chart 9 shows our sales guidance for the year, again reflecting no change from our initial guidance. Chart 10 shows the $50 million increase in our segment operating profit outlook for the year, with all the change resulting from our increase in expectations for Electronic Systems. And finally, we wrap up with our summary on Chart 11. While we're mindful of the open labor negotiations in our Aeronautics business area and the potential impacts of sequestration, we're off to a good start for the year. And with that, we're ready for your questions. Shawn?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: If it's okay, I actually have one question for Bruce and then what I think may be a quick question here for Bob. Bruce, I'm just looking at your Electronic Systems margins here, which seem to be well above expectations. I want to know if you could provide some color on the risk retirement events that allowed margins at ES to expand so much. And any specifics you could provide would be helpful there.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, 15% is obviously a little higher than we run in years' past. In fact, I think it's probably the highest rate for any of the business area, possibly in the history of the corporation. As I look at the performance adjustments in the quarter, they were unusually high in the first quarter. And as you said, particularly in Electronic Systems, most specifically within Missiles and Fire Control, think of it being about $150 million more first quarter this year than the first quarter last year. And as I look at that -- and I think we had accelerated performance milestones, as I said on the previous discussion, contractual action, a number of risk retirements. I'll give you a couple of examples. One, for instance, was we reached initial operating capability on our Sniper pods for the Australian F-18 aircraft this quarter where we expected to do that in a subsequent quarter this year. We also had a number of completions of block delivery items. And by that, I mean where we're shipping a large quantity of, in this case, missiles, HELLFIRE missiles, MLRSs and the like where, upon the completion of a group of deliveries, that results in a reduction of risk retirements for that block. And in some cases, that actually resulted in a reduction of warranty obligations. And so we had sort of a double whammy effect for those 2 events in the quarter earlier than planned. As I look throughout the rest of the year, Rich, I do think we're going to expect to return to lower levels of profit adjustments going forward in the remaining quarters. And I expect that total year will be very much in line with what we experienced in 2011. I think you had a question for Bob, did you?
Richard Tobie Safran - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Yes, thanks, Bruce. Bob, at the risk of this being a somewhat sensitive topic, I want to know if I can get a comment from you on negotiations with the Machinists Union of Fort Worth. I want to know if you could talk about the impact of a protracted disagreement. Is this a situation that's serious enough where, for example, you think you have the potential to lay off personnel? And I'm only asking this because the news reports I'm looking at seem to indicate that the Union is making statements like they're ready for a long strike, that kind of thing.
Robert J. Stevens: Yes, I appreciate the question, and it is a matter that we're focused on. I mentioned in discussions with the media earlier today that I was surprised that the IAM went on strike. And the reason was that we have not asked the IAM union workers in Fort Worth to do anything our other employees have not already done. For some time now, we've been converting the company from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan, and this is a practice that is not unique to our company. It is not unique in our industry, and it's a practice that's entirely consistent with today's economic realities. Nothing is being taken away from current union employees in the offer that we've presented. I believe it's very competitive in today's economy, reflecting our value of the work that's being done by our union employees. And it's not clear to me how, in this environment, how many new employees we'll be hiring in the future. But any new employees hired in the future will be offered a pension plan. And I personally think it would be an unfortunate outcome to have a strike over the principal issue of defined benefit pension plans for future hires to cause any unnecessary disruption in the F-35 program or any other program that would put the employment of our current workers at risk. Every action that this company has taken for many years now has been to stabilize our program base, particularly in the face of mounting uncertainty with regard to overall economic resources available. So I believe this action was certainly unwelcome. Having said that, we have a contingency plan in place. We're compelled now to execute that contingency plan, and we are. We continue to fly the airplanes, and we continue to build the airplanes. But I do believe, in every sense, the offer that we've put forward to the union was a fair and reasonable position.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: My question, Bob, is on the F-35. We've seen, with the release of the budget the last few months, a lower ramp within -- over the next 5 years within -- for the U.S. And there's been a number of countries that have -- the waffling, I guess, publicly, of some of your customers internationally has continued. And I'm wondering if you could give us an update on your view on, I guess, where you stand on that, the potential cost spiral and all the issues that I know you're very focused on.
Robert J. Stevens: I would tell you, I think the actions that were taken recently, even with the phasing out of additional airplanes, added a little bit to a sense of stability in the program. We might be looking at quantities less than we would have preferred to see, but I think we've stabilized. I think the performance of the airplane is being quite recognized pretty broadly by customers. It is not to say we don't have challenges, but we're making progress against the set of challenges. We have known corrective actions for observations that have been made in the flight test program. I get reinforced -- reinforcing language from our partners pretty consistently, and we had a favorable decision in Japan. We're looking at Korea. We're working effectively with Israel on the international front. I think -- it's quite understandable to me, Joe, that the leadership in our partner governments are looking at their security challenges and their economic challenges, and they may be talking about phasing an airplane here or there. But it also strikes me as very clear that they are uniformly committed to a fifth-generation airplane, because they believe that airplane over the next 50 years will provide the maximum amount of security and the best investment of very scarce security dollars. So I think we've gotten some very strong reinforcing views of their commitment and interest in the program. It is our job to go execute that. And not to conflate issues, Joe, but that's why the strike was a bit of a surprise to me and why we'd liked to have this matter resolved.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Bob, I was wondering if you could comment on your cash deployment strategy and whether you're comfortable with the allocation that you currently have between buybacks, dividends and potentially acquisitions going forward.
Robert J. Stevens: Yes, I think we're generally pleased with what we have done historically and where we are today. Robert, I know you know we look at this on a continuous basis. We're giving it a great attention now. But I think it has served the company well, and I think it has served the interest of investors well.
Bruce L. Tanner: Rob, I'll jump in from my perspective as well. I look at our cash deployment practice, and I think the key word there has been flexibility and specifically, flexibility to address sort of 4 constituents that I always think of relative to cash deployment. Obviously, starting with folks like yourself and shareholders where we consider dividends, stock repurchase. I also think the ability to have some fairly quick action on acquisitions, by having some cash in the bank to enable us to do some quick decisions and not have to wait on financing, for instance, is a help as well. I look at customers and there, the ability to make the critical investments from both a capital expenditure and IRAD perspective, our independent research and development. I think having some consideration for addressing potential continuing resolution impacts in advance of sequestration impacts, including the effects of small suppliers and being able to decide what makes sense from a disruption perspective as far as helping some of those smaller suppliers through these periods of funding uncertainty, I think, is also helpful. I look at employees as another constituent, and that's -- primarily, that relates to funding the pension plan, which I think we've demonstrated our willingness to do that quite long, or for quite some time. And lastly, I look at debt holders. And there, I think maintaining the appropriate ratings levels relative to our desires going forward, keeping a balance between the demands of equity holders and debt holders is a critical element there as well. And I think the question is sort of maintaining that balance and maintaining that flexibility going forward. I think Chris has one other add here.
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Yes, Rob. And as you would expect, I've obviously been part of the decision and strategy and perfectly aligned with Bob and Bruce. And I don't anticipate any changes in our cash deployment strategy as I look to the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Following up on the last question, particularly, Bruce, it sounds a little bit like your strategy is evolving as the environment changes. You talked before about -- obviously lead with the dividend, highest yield in the sector. And you've talked about continuing that momentum, maintaining the strong buyback and reminded us in the past that you've got the cash balance to allow for that. But now with the stock where it is, you're guiding to a $1-billion buyback. So have we seen the peak in the buyback at this point? And is there any difference in your M&A strategy? It seems like you're preserving cash for more options than you did even just a quarter ago.
Bruce L. Tanner: Rob, I think we still have a long-standing 50% free cash flow commitment to shareholders. That's obviously been changing over time such that now, the dividend practically gets us to the 50% of free cash flow. I want to be able to remain opportunistic as far as share repurchases are concerned. And as you might expect, if we took a look at what we spent in the first quarter, this year, we actually spent almost the exact same amount as we spent in the first quarter of last year. So we're tracking very closely to both $0.25 billion that we committed to as well as short tracking to where we were last year. I think we'll be opportunistic. I mean, obviously, the stock has run up some on price. I think our commitment relative to the dividends has been very consistent. We've had 8 consecutive years -- 9 consecutive years, excuse me, of double-digit increases in our dividend policy. And as I always say, I think that's -- our past track record is the best indicator of where we're going in the future with that -- with regard to that. I do think, on the acquisition side, we are still in that marketplace, as I've said on the first quarter call. I do like having the flexibility to make quick decisions relative to engaging. There is more competition, I think, with some of the acquisitions that we're looking at. And so I think there's not a huge change as you said, kind of a change in the style going forward relative to cash deployment. I wouldn't say it's a huge change, but we are mindful of -- this is a little bit a different environment than we've been in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes. I believe you had 12 weeks versus 13, and yet your sales were particularly strong, and I know you had a pull forwards in aeronautical. Can you give us a little more color and just why they were quite so strong x the aeronautical, which I think you've already explained?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Cai, I'll take that one on. It was 12 weeks to your point, and I'll maybe anticipate the next question, the 14th week happens in the third quarter of this year. So you may see the offset of that in the third quarter coming up. Most of the sales increase was, frankly, on deliveries as opposed to cost volume and is -- and particularly true, obviously in the Aeronautics business area, but that was also true, in large part, in Electronic Systems. I think as I looked at least at IS&GS, I was particularly pleased to see where they ended the first quarter, even though they were down 3%, the fact that it was down 3%. And they've got a fairly large portion of sales that are sort of cost-based POC, percentage of completion-based sales and were still only down 3%. I think it's a real help as far as me feeling good about their performance for the rest of the year. I mentioned some growth in Intelligence that helped offset some of the AMF JTRS reduction. That obviously would have been greater had we had another week in the quarter. So I think that's benefited us. Again, I think, as I said at the -- with the prepared remarks, I think we were a little bit higher in sales in the first quarter than we had anticipated, especially given the 12 weeks. I think it's a little too early. Obviously, we held the sales outlook constant for the year. I think it's a little too early to say there's an increase in the rest of the year out there. So we've kept -- committed to the $45 billion to $46 billion. And I'll leave it at that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm interested in IS&GS in that -- just trying to understand, when you look forward -- we've seen a little bit of contraction in backlog. And if you're looking forward and you split this into defense, intel and civil, how are you seeing the outlook right now over the next few years in those different markets? And then what are you seeing also in terms of the competitive environment? Are you seeing more competition on individual contracts as they come up?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Doug, I'll try that one as well. As we look at IS&GS, and I'm just kind of looking at some of my notes here, I think the surprise -- not a surprise, but the biggest driver of the downer in the first quarter, as I said within the defense line of business, again offset in large part by the Intelligence side, civil kind of stayed flat relative to the prior year's first quarter. And I think, going forward, that's probably going to be somewhat the story for the rest of this year. The Civil business is going to be flat to slightly lower than it was last year. Defense was going to be down, primarily because of the AMF JTRS. Intelligence is going to be down to slightly flat, but possibly with some growth because of what we saw happen in the first quarter. I'm optimistic really in all 3 lines of business relative to our ability to grow some of the cyber activities. Cutting across, as I've said, all 3 lines of business. I think we're finally starting to see -- I know you guys have probably been tired of us talking about cyber for so long without much results across the industry, but I think we're starting to see some traction there that has been helping us to have some growth there. Going forward, there's also opportunities. As you all notice, this is a business area where we have most of our adjacent market opportunities, and that includes the energy, health care. We made the acquisition last year with QTC from a health care perspective. And I think that's got some prospects to help maybe mitigate some of the -- particularly lightness in the defense in the near term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you just talk -- and guess it's mostly Bruce, but can you talk a little bit about the order environment? In the past, you talked about the first half would be relatively weak. And I know the Aeronautics shipments were up, but the backlog there did decline $2 billion sequentially. So can you just talk about how that backlog in the order activity is going to look as we look through the year?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, sure, Sam. I like to think we teed it up as we expected to happen in the first quarter. I think in the January, probably said we expect it to go down sequentially. I'll say, as I sit here today, I think second quarter is going to go down from the first quarter, although I'll say a lot of that is dependent upon the ongoing F-35 negotiations. So depending on when the LRIP 5 negotiation finishes, depending on when we get additional funding for the Undefinitized Contractual Action or the UCA for LRIP 6 and depending on when we get the long-lead funding for LRIP 7, that will bounce between second and third quarter likely. If those all were to happen in the second quarter, we might actually see some growth. If not, I think we'll have a big third quarter. We are expecting in the third quarter to have some good government satellite orders. We're also expecting the F-16 mod program for the Taiwanese government to happen in the third quarter. And in fourth quarter, we always expect that to be our largest order of all 4 quarters. That's where we get the orders for the fiscal year, the new fiscal year coming up. And think about it as fleet, ballistic missile, PAC-3 and, in this case, the C-5 FY '13 order, which is getting bigger and bigger every year as those quantities go up. So I think I keyed up at the last call that we thought by the end of this year we'd get close to where we were at the end of last year, and I still think that's kind of where we see it as we sit here today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a quick question on cash. I want to focus in on the cadence for cash generation for the rest of this year, having you remind us perhaps of what your pension contribution plans are for this year. Perhaps pension contributions for next year as well. And just talk about the impact of FAS/CAS Harmonization and how you are viewing that at this point from cash generation as we move into some of the out-years. But if you could give us a flavor of cadence for the rest of this year, what cash might do next year, particularly as it relates to pension contributions. And then longer term, what FAS/CAS is going to do for you.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Jason, let me try to address all of those for you. You talked about the cadence of cash for the year and pension contributions. I tried to tee up actually on the, I think -- probably the December call or the October call, excuse me. If not October, definitely January, that we're going to have a little different profile in cash in 2012 as maybe compared to prior years where we're going to have a lower first half of the year in cash and probably a higher second half of the year than we've experienced in previous years. I still think that's going to happen. First quarter obviously showed -- followed suit to that pattern, if you will. Second quarter, I'm expecting it to look a lot like the first quarter basically. We've already made a $600 million contribution to the pension plan. That satisfies all of the required contributions to the pension plan in 2011. That's the full $1.1 billion roughly. We also had 2 tax payments as we normally do in the second quarter, and that's why it's keeping it at that $0.5 billion level. We do think the second half of the year will be much higher than the first 2 quarters and get to the $3.8 billion. Again, we told you and at least I told you in the prepared remarks that I -- we're increasing or at least feel more confident in our ability to generate a $3.8 billion, at least that much, with the additional operating profit that we're generating. I think you asked -- I'm trying to recall this. I think you asked what the contribution for pensions was next year. It grows fairly considerably. Just think of it as $1.1 billion this year. It's probably another $1 billion-ish next year to $2.1 billion or so. The CAS contribution grows slightly, maybe $300 million or $400 million as we sit here today. The real -- I think the real heart of your question, Jason, is so what happens over time with that contribution? And you should think of us from a sort of a CAS Harmonization perspective as having roughly $4 billion of advanced contributions to the ERISA versus what we recovered from a CAS perspective. And so what CAS Harmonization is doing is spreading that advanced funding, if you will, that $4 billion over the period of the CAS Harmonization recovery. So think of that as 2013 through 2017. So that'll be spread -- not quite peanut butter but 25% increments each year. 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% over that period of time. So we expect the operating cash will get a pretty significant benefit from the recovery of that previously funded ERISA payments over the next few years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions on Aeronautics. First, can you give us your latest view on what 2012 versus 2011 units by program should look like? And then if you could provide any commentary on '13 versus '12 as well, even if just directionally, that'd be helpful. And then on Aeronautics' margins that kind of been reset lower as you're layering in more lower-margin revenue, the guidance, I guess, implies they kind of moved back towards '11 through the rest of the year. I'm just wondering if you could provide any comments on -- your thoughts on the direction of the Aeronautics margin beyond 2012 for the next couple of years.
Bruce L. Tanner: Noah, I'll take that as well. So in terms of the deliveries by program, I think was the first part of your question, maybe '12 versus '11, I think we're up pretty significantly in our F-16 deliveries, especially in the year 2012 versus '11. We're going to be somewhere around the 40 aircraft in 2012 for F-16s versus -- I think we did 22 in 2011. Quite a few of those get delivered off of the Turkish assembly line. I think more than 1/2, if I recall, come off the Turkish line. The rest of those come off of the Fort Worth F-16 line. C-130s are fairly constant to last year. We'll do -- I think we did 33 last year. We'll do that number, maybe 34 this year. The other program has got some quantity increases as the C-5 program. We delivered 2 last year. We'll likely do about 6 this year. I think the F-35 is probably well known and will stay fairly flat in that period of time, somewhere in the 30 aircraft mode. I'll remind you again, we're still booking those early Low-Rate initial Production contracts on a percentage of completion basis. So sales will not tie to the deliveries of those aircraft, if you will. And then I think you talked about the Aeronautics margin this year and going forward. We have been talking about the aero margin coming down when the associated volume of the F-35 program starts to pick up. And that program brings with it greater weight at a lower margin. We still think that's the case. I think as I look forward, we're going to come down some from where we are in 2012. Frankly, we benefited in 2011, and we're still benefiting in 2012 from a number of the cost-reduction activities that we've put in place over the past 18 months or so. Think of those, as Bob talked about, some facility issues or facility reduction, some headcount reductions. Some of that benefits the U.S. government. Some of that benefits the contractor, in this case, us. And we're seeing that materialize in margin improvements, not just in Aeronautics but especially in Electronic Systems as well. That helped 2012 from where I kind of thought we'd be a year ago. I still think we're going to come off that number, the 11% number going forward, because of the F-35 volume. We'll be somewhere in the 10-ish. 10%, 10.5% range would be my guesstimate over the next couple of years from a margin perspective for Aero.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Bob, you talked about the flight test program for the F-35 tracking ahead of schedule. I'm curious if you can talk about it not from the hardware side but from the software side and kind of some of the schedule milestones that you're looking at there, where you are relative to the respective block schedules and whether you're on par with the plan or still tracking a few months behind.
Robert J. Stevens: Yes, Myles. It just so happens that we have our Chief Operating Officer here with us today who knows everything there is to know about F-35 software schedules.
Christopher Eugene Kubasik: Yes, Myles let me talk about Block 2A. That's the next milestone that we're focused on. We're a couple of months behind schedule. There's some pressure on that. The good news is that both ourselves and our customers see this status in the same fashion, and we're working on a recovery plan. So sometime in the middle of 2012, whether it's July or September, in that time frame, we will be in a position to deliver Block 2A. And again, the ultimate delivery under the development plan for the remaining of the software is due in the 2016, 2017 time frame. So we have 3 years to get to 2B and the IOC. So I'm pleased with the progress that we're making. About 90% of the airborne software code has already been written. And a little more than 85% is in the lab and in flight tests. So we're tracking this on a regular basis, made some good progress here of late and confident the team will deliver.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.
George Shapiro: Yes, Bruce, I wanted to pursue the F-35 margin. Based on the lot of disclosure that you gave in the report, it looks like the F-35 margin on the production went up this year from last year. If you could just talk a little bit about what caused that and where we might expect it to go.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, George. As usual, you're pretty perceptive. And I think you gave us a back-handed compliment on the disclosure, so we appreciate that as well. I'll pass that along to the team. The F-35 margins on the production side on the Low-Rate Initial Production contracts -- I think I tried to tee up in the last couple of calls that we're nearing completion of the deliveries of each one of the early, early LRIP contracts. And so in the case of, I believe, of LRIP 1 and LRIP 2, we're far enough along on deliveries of those 2 in particular, that we did have some performance adjustments on the positive side, simply reflecting the fact that we've come -- in the case of LRIP 1, we've delivered those aircraft. In the case of LRIP 2, we're making very good progress on completions of the aircraft out of the factory for that lot as well. And as you would expect, the risk retirements associated with that progress enabled us to make an improvement in the performance adjustments that we just talked about. Going forward, I think there might be some potential for some additional on the latter -- additional LRIP 2 or LRIP 3. I don't think anything sizable. And I think the overall margins as far as where we see it is kind of -- think of between mid and double-digit sorts of levels for the year, is where we think the LRIP contracts will come out in total.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lewis of Lazard Capital.
Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Yes, and I just wanted to circle back on F-35 for a second and get your opinion on exactly how you expect the Congress to come back with these markups and what else you would expect, whether there's additional aircraft that could be brought back into the program in '13 and '14.
Robert J. Stevens: I believe that the fiscal '13 bill, which is on the hill now, is being marked. And let me say so far, because we're not completely through these discussions. I think the early indication is the House marked it 29 airplanes, the Senate has not yet marked. Our conclusion after discussions, again recognizing we're not through with the process, is that there's a good level of support for the quantity of the program that's been described in the rephasing of the production plan. So I have this sense that there is a view that we've got the program better managed and better focused than we're earning value in both the flight test program and on the production line and that we need to stabilize the production build, focus on cost reduction and affordability and there's a general level of support for the quantities that Bruce and I have referred you to over time. We see those quantities as being, let me say, within a range of 30 to 32-ish kind of airplanes flat for a couple of years, and that's the U.S. content. So I think -- and a corollary to your question is can that be changed? I don't think it's likely to be changed from the U.S. domestic buy. But we might see an increase in airplanes, probably not in the very near term, but we could see an increase in airplanes during this flattish period where international customers to come forward and combine their buy with the U.S. buy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I'd wanted to go back, this is probably for Bruce, and talk about the kind of elephant in the room and sequestration and contingency planning and how you prepare for that kind of looming wall. And I recall, last year, as we led up to the debt ceiling negotiation and the potential for a government shutdown, you dialed back a bit on the cash deployment in the case that you may need it to self-fund some things. And so I wonder if there are scenarios that you evaluate as we move closer to the end of the year and you think about some of the things that may happen in terms of sequestration and ways you may deal with it if there's a scenario where we could see that sort of action being taken again.
Bruce L. Tanner: Carter, great question. And as you would probably expect, we are looking at multiple scenarios. I'll be honest here and say they're difficult because they're kind of scenarios of our own making since we don't have a whole lot of direction that we can rely on, as far as what the effects of sequestration will actually have on an individual program basis. So as I said, you would expect us to be doing some scenario playing out. We're doing that right now as we speak. I think we'll get a little better visibility, possibly as we head into the summer time frame from our customer in this regard. At least, as I've looked at it, Carter, the thing that I'm watching the closest, and I think may be the most interesting part relative to 2012 going forward, is the very likely chance that we're going to have a continuing resolution in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. So in the fourth quarter of 2012. And I think it's going to be an interesting study to see if our government customers -- by definition, continuing resolution normally says you kind of spend at the same level of the new fiscal year as you did at the prior fiscal year. It's going to be interesting to see what happens in this continuing resolution with the prospects of a sequestration 3 months after the continuing resolution will start, if it starts. And specifically, whether or not customers feel comfortable or not sort of holding the line at the same level as the prior fiscal year, or whether or not we see a reduction in the continuing resolution in anticipation of sequestration. So those obviously are prospects that we're concerned about. You read what I was trying to describe relative to cash deployment rank. We're trying to keep all of our options open there and do what makes the most efficient sense for us to continue performing throughout the rest of this calendar year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Bob, Bruce is having all the fun here. Maybe I could just -- your could touch base on further portfolio shaping. This is something I know that you guys evaluate on a constant basis. But what's the latest status now that we've got this kind of fog bank out there with sequestration and everything else and what you're seeing on the budgets?
Robert J. Stevens: You're -- I think you refer to it as fog bank. The uncertainty associated with sequestration does add a new dimension to portfolio shaping. We have this portfolio shaping over time. We very much like the quality of the portfolio we have now. We think the portfolio in the core business actually has the potential for future growth with international expansion. And as Bruce mentioned in his remarks earlier, we're looking to add content to the company through adjacent markets. We're constantly evaluating this portfolio. I rather think what you should expect to see from us are cost reductions of the nature we've been describing in facilities consolidations that unfortunately are very difficult and painful reductions in force, where the programs are relevant to the businesses have been reshaped. We're focusing maximum attention on efficiency that drives affordability for our customers. I would like to get some more visibility as to the more specific consequences of sequestration because it's such a significant number. And as Bruce mentioned, it's not very specifically detailed that we would like to see more about that. And then we would add that as an overlay to our ongoing evaluation of how our portfolio is performing today and likely to perform in the future. We have a sufficient amount of firepower to add to our portfolio. We have sufficient talent and leadership in the company to add resources to any segment of that portfolio to either improve its performance or to take segments of our portfolio into new markets with new customers to facilitate future growth. But insofar as sequestration is sitting out there, I think we're going to have to go along a little bit so that we have a broader knowledge base, and we'd like to make our decisions with a little higher confidence that we understand the circumstances and the implications of those decisions before we make them. So with the uncertainty, I think we're going to continue our evaluation here.
Jerry F. Kircher: Shawn, this is Jerry. I'm afraid we're coming up on the hour, and we do have a hard stop here today. So maybe we'll let Bob make some final comments? But we appreciate everybody's questions.
Robert J. Stevens: Well, certainly. Let me thank everybody again for joining the call today. We are going to stay focused on being very strong in a tough environment and are taking all the actions that are necessary to drive future growth in the company. And we are all looking forward to seeing you in July. Thanks, Shawn.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Robert J. Stevens: Okay, thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. All of us here hope that your new year is off to a very good start. Let me begin with a quick summary of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we booked almost $20 billion in new business awards from domestic and international customers and finished the year with a record backlog of almost $81 billion. Strong program execution, coupled with ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, enabled segment operating margins to increase to 11.5% for the quarter and 11.4% for the year, which reflected improvements over prior-year levels. Cash generation was exceptional with $1.1 billion in cash from operations in the quarter after making accelerated pension contributions of $1 billion and over $4.2 billion for the year, surpassing the prior year by more than $450 million. We paid $325 million in dividends in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the year as we continue to execute our $4 a share annual dividend payout. Share repurchases continued in the quarter and totaled almost 32 million shares for the year, enabling the retirement of 7% of the outstanding shares. With this focus, we generated a 21% total shareholder return with 16% stock price appreciation and a 5% dividend yield. These results reflect the quality of our workforce, the dedication of our leaders and the strength of our corporation and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders. Thanks to everyone in the company who played a role in driving these results. Since we last spoke in October, we've seen an expansion and in some cases, an amplification of the uncertainty evident in the global security environment and in world economic conditions. The events playing out in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt, North Korea, China and many other regions of the world underscore the complexity and the volatility embedded in the mission of maintaining global security. Many signs of economic stress remain, and the global recovery appears to be, at best, uneven and slow. On the domestic horizon, we see change as well. Earlier this month, the administration released a new security strategy highlighting priorities for our 21st century defense. Citing the strategic turning point after a decade of war that is now concluding, the joint force will be reshaped to be smaller and leaner, but more agile, flexible, ready and technologically advanced. Forces are to be rebalanced with more emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East while assuring additional focus on the critical priorities of Space and cyberspace, Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance communications and navigation systems, counterterrorism and irregular warfare and effective nuclear deterrent and counter weapons of mass destruction capabilities. There will be an emphasis on air and naval forces while reducing land forces, and on building more effective security cooperation partnerships with friends and allies. The President's 2013 budget is also set to be delivered to Congress on February 13. And Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, gave an executive summary look at the DoD portion just 1 hour ago in a press conference at the Pentagon, which actually may still be ongoing. The Secretary described a fiscal '13 budget request of $525 billion in the base budget that compares to a $531 billion defense budget in fiscal '12, along with a request for $88.4 billion for overseas contingency operations. This new budget reflects the new security strategy and includes the effects of last year's Budget Control Act that triggered the administration's proposal to reduce the defense top line by $487 billion through 2021, with $259 billion of that reduction occurring between 2013 and 2017. This significant and substantial $487 billion reduction, in conjunction with the new security strategy, assures that commitments to deficit and debt reduction are met while maintaining an adequate security posture necessary in the uncertain and volatile world that we see today. While we'll gain additional details about specific program funding levels in the budget as more information becomes available, the clear contours of the new strategy align exceedingly well with our portfolio and our experience. This alignment is no accident. Even as our national focus was appropriately on ground operations in Iraq and Afghanistan after having committed forces there, our assessment of the global security environment suggests that the long arc of our national strategic interest would orient toward the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. That regional security there would be influenced by China, North Korea, Iran and others who are investing heavily in advanced technologies. That these technologies would include sophisticated anti-access and area-denial capabilities, the advancement of nuclear and other weapons and the missile systems necessary for their delivery, and an increasingly elaborate series of cyber systems and methods, all of which would require a response, and further that sustained pressure in world economic conditions would continue to impose constraints on the resources available to government, leading to more cooperation on shared security objectives. That's why we took action years ago to refine the architecture of our products to assure they would incorporate the most advanced sensor fusion and communications capabilities, such that real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information could be leveraged, and that our systems would be flexible and adaptable in meeting emerging challenges. And that's why the architecture of our business model was structured on promoting sustainable security cooperation partnerships where interoperability would support more effective coalition action and leverage the global supply chain. While we clearly recognize there would be challenges with this strategic approach, requiring us initially to deal with additional measure of innovation and the complexity that results from that innovation, our strategy is proving to be durable and well aligned. The result is a robust and increasingly mature portfolio of relevant global systems that are meeting the needs of our customers in addressing global challenges, systems like the Joint Strike Fighter, supporting 3 U.S. services, 8 initial partners and the needs of an increasing number of international customers, most recently Japan; or our missile defense capabilities, including Egypt's PAC-3 and THAAD, which are setting the standard for U.S. and allied defenses as reflected in the recent selection of THAAD by the United Arab Emirates; or the Littoral Combat Ship that is driving innovation and adaptability to a more affordable solution to meet the expanding array of demands clearly present in the littoral waters around the globe; or our space-based assets, including Advanced EHF, MUOS, SBIRS, GPS III and other satellite systems that enable unparalleled situational awareness, secure communications, precision navigation and prompt global response. We're continuing today to apply the very same energy, rigor, talent and resources to further integrate systems at [ph] a more effective command and control, constructing more resilient networks and preparing the information technology environment for the hazards of expanding cyber threats while driving greater levels of efficiency and affordability across our company. There is much more work yet to do, which is why we are greatly distressed by the prospect of sequestration. That element of existing law mandated by the failure of the Super Committee to find additional spending reductions. The resulting automatic across-the-board budget cuts and sequestration would approximately double the $487 billion top line reduction already reflected in defense funding with an additional $52 billion reduction in 2013. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has spoken in the strongest possible terms against sequestration, which he described as having catastrophic consequences to our defense. We support this view completely. The sequestration process has occurred independent of any correlation with strategy, core [ph] structure, technology needs or operational reality. While the precise detailing of the adverse impacts of sequestration are yet to be determined, the United States would likely have the smallest ground force since 1940, the fewest number of ships since 1915 and the smallest Air Force in our nation's history. The impact on industry would be devastating. With a significant disruption of ongoing programs and initiatives, facility closures and personnel reductions that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operations, erode engineering expertise and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge, directly undermining a key provision of the new security strategy, which is to preserve the industrial base. We understand well the fiscal pressures our nation faces and have not hesitated in realigning the cost bases in our business through expense reductions, rebalancing the workforce, consolidating facilities and the like, and we'll continue to do so. And we recognize that the Department of Defense is committed to $0.5 trillion reduction over the next 10 years, an ambitious initiative that we fully support. But our position on sequestration is very clear. We must not let an automatic budget trigger, a default position in effect only due to a committee failure, to become the dominant force for allocating resources and shaping our nation's security posture, and we strongly urge action to stop this process. Before I ask Bruce to give you some color and details on our performance, I want to highlight an organizational change we announced this morning. After 37 years of distinguished service, Ralph Heath advised of his plans to retire from our company. I have worked with Ralph for a very long time now, and found him to be an exceptional executive in every respect. He's been dedicated and professional in every assignment, and he's set the standard for ethics and business conduct. Ralph's decision highlights why we've invested so much time and energy in our talent management, our leadership development and our succession planning process over the years, subjects we really don't talk a lot about on this call, but subjects vitally important to our future success. Through this process, we now have an outstanding cadre of highly qualified executives ready to assume additional responsibilities and take our business forward. Effective April 1, Larry Lawson will serve as Executive Vice President of our Aeronautics business replacing Ralph, and the business could not be in better hands. Larry brings a proven track record of success in all that he has done. Orlando Carvalho will succeed Larry as Vice President, General Manager of the F-35 program. You may recall that Orlando jointed Aeronautics in August of 2011 after serving as President of our Maritime Systems & Sensors business. Orlando's 30 years of experience in complex systems and in organizational leadership equip him well for the demands of the F-35. Lorraine Martin will serve as Orlando's deputy on the F-35 program, moving from the C-130, and George Shultz will assume responsibilities for C-130 operations. I mention these names because they represent the breadth and depth of talent in this company. Each has decades of experience, worked in diversified assignments, driven higher levels of performance and have built superb teams. When I tell you that it's a privilege for me to work in this company, I'm talking about the opportunity to work with leaders like Ralph, Larry, Orlando, Lorraine and George, and I thank them all. So I have Bruce now go through some of the details of our performance, and then we'll open up the lines for questions. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner: Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of the full year for 2011. We grew sales for the company by 2% over our 2010 level and given the environment we operated in throughout the year, we're pleased with those results. We're even more pleased with the record backlog amount for the full year driven by almost $20 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, as Bob said. Segment margins were 40 basis points higher than last year, reflecting a strong performance year for us with much of that improvement stemming from cost-reduction actions that we took earlier this year -- or last year, excuse me. Our earnings per share from continuing operation were 11% higher than 2010, and we generated $4.3 billion in cash from operations while accelerating $1 billion in pension contributions previously planned for 2012. So overall, 2011 was a very strong execution year, and our results reflect that performance. On Chart 4, we'll look at sales by the 4 business areas. Two of the 4 business areas grew sales for the year led by a strong 10% increase in Aeronautics sales over 2010 levels. Electronic Systems had 2% growth for the year, better than what we premised when the year began. As anticipated, IS&GS declined by 5%, driven mostly by the absence of the U.S. Census activity this year. And Space ended the year relatively flat compared with 2010 as we expected. Turning to Chart 5, and our backlog to end the year, all 4 business areas grew backlog in the fourth quarter, and the company increased backlog by about $8 billion in the third -- from -- over the third quarter level. Key orders recognized in the quarter included: additional funding for the F-35 LRIP 5 contract, as well as F-16 awards from Oman and Iraq in Aeronautics; additional domestic and international PAC-3 orders; a $1 billion order to upgrade Warrior fighting vehicles in the U.K.; and our first international order for the THAAD program electronic systems; the award of the NSF Polar contract to IS&GS and the FY '12 installment of the Fleet Ballistic Missile contract in Space Systems along with an award for the initial launch of an unmanned Orion capsule in 2014. Chart 6 highlights that we grew backlog in 2011 by over $2 billion to $80.7 billion, a record for the corporation. This is the second consecutive year we've grown our backlog, and ending backlog is about $2 billion higher than our expectations at the start of the year. Moving to Chart 7. You can see the significant improvement in margins for both the fourth quarter and total year compared with 2010, again resulting from strong program execution and our cost reduction actions. And these cost reductions are benefiting our customers as we price new business. On Chart 8, we'll discuss our earnings per share. Our EPS from continuing operations increased 11% to $7.85 for the year. I'll remind you that last year included charges for our VESP program and the elimination of Medicare Part D subsidies. However, when adjusting both years for the negative impacts of the FAS/CAS adjustment, our pension adjusted earnings per share grew 21% over 2010 levels. Turning to Chart 9. You can see the effects of our cash deployment actions returning $2.5 billion back to our shareholders through share repurchases and $1.1 billion in the form of dividends during the year. Combined, we returned 109% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2011 and returned almost $200 million more than the prior year's amount. On Chart 10, we show the impacts of our share repurchases over time. 2011 was the second straight year that we've reduced outstanding share count by 7%, and we've reduced shares outstanding by more than 100 million shares over the last 5 years. Chart 11 shows that our total shareholder return last year was significantly outperforming all of major benchmarks. The TSR reflects both the strong execution in the year and the cash deployment actions from the prior chart. Beginning with Chart 12, we'll discuss our outlook for the year 2012. Our sales for the year are expected to be about 2% lower than 2011 at the midpoint of our guidance. And segment profit generally falls to sales volume with our segment margins expected to remain above 11% for the year. I'll discuss both sales and segment operating profit in greater detail in the next chart. Moving down the chart, our FAS/CAS adjustment has improved from the trends we gave in October, I'll also speak more about this change in a couple of charts. Our earnings per share guidance for the year is $7.70 to $7.90 per share, and as a reminder, does not include any consideration for the R&D tax credit being extended into 2012. Think of that R&D tax credit being worth about $0.10 per share of benefit in 2011. Finally, our cash from operations guidance is $3.8 billion, up slightly from what we described last quarter. I should point out that we expect the phasing our cash from operations this year to be different from prior years, and that our cash will be significantly higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. We'll be making the planned pension contributions in the first half with around $500 million in the first quarter and the remainder in the second quarter. And we also have a tax payment in the first quarter, while we had a tax refund in the first quarter of 2011.  Chart 13 provides our guidance ranges for both sales and segment operating profit by the 4 business areas. For sales, we now expect both Electronic Systems and Aeronautics to remain relatively flat at the midpoint compared with 2011, while IS&GS and Space Systems are expected to see a reduction in sales. You'll recall that when we discussed our trend data during the third quarter call, we had expected sales to remain relatively flat compared to 2011. Two key events occurred at the end of the year that changed that outlook. First, we were unsuccessful in our bids to win the GMD competition. This results in sales in our Space Systems segment being lower than expected when we spoke in October. Second, we've reduced our guidance for IS&GS as a result of recent customer directions to stop activities on the AMF JTRS program by the end of February. Our segment operating profit guidance is driven mostly by the sales volume. The margins for Aeronautics Space and IS&GS are expected to be down slightly, reflecting a lower dollar amount of profit rate adjustments planned for 2012 as compared to 2011, while Electronic Systems is expected to have consistent margins with what we saw in 2011. Chart 14 shows the changes that impacted our FAS/CAS adjustment from what we described last quarter. We ended the year with a slightly higher discount rate of 4.75% versus the 4.5% we discussed in the third quarter. And this improved the negative FAS/CAS adjustment by $115 million. We also had other updates, which partially offset the impact of the higher discount rate by some $25 million, resulting in the 2012 FAS/CAS adjustment of an $835 million headwind on reported earnings. And finally, on Chart 15, we have our summary. 2011 was a strong year by any measure and reflects the focus that our team demonstrated throughout the year. 2012 is expected to be a solid year, building on the strategic alignment of our portfolio, our record backlog and the strong cash generation we've demonstrated for many years. With that, Jovan, I think we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi Investment.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a quick question on the guidance and the Secretary's comments that he made this afternoon. Does your guidance reflect the things that he had to say this afternoon or is there a potential risk either to the upside or to the downside after you parse through his comments?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Jason, I'll take that one on. Obviously, we're still sorting through what the Secretary is saying. But I think in any event, I don't think there is a change to the 2012 guidance. Essentially, anything that would happen at least that I'm aware of in the conversations that he had today would affect 2013 and beyond, but we've still got some sorting out to do to see exactly what that impact would be. Bob, offer any other comments as you might want...
Robert J. Stevens: Jason, just another thought. I think the Secretary gave some executive summary views, and so we and others could get a sense of the shape and overall feel. But I think our experience has been entirely valuable to get into the details, the time phasing and other facets of the budget proper, and I don't think that's going to be available to us until February 13. So I think we'll give you -- we'll be able to give you much better insight as to our overall reaction to what is just really breaking news today when we next speak with you. But as Bruce said, it doesn't feel likely that we're overly sensitive in fiscal -- in our current fiscal year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I wanted to get an update on your views on the F-35 right now. I know when -- Bob, when you talked after Q3, there were issues when you look at LRIP 5 in terms of the structure of that program, the risks involved in potentially having to –- pay for work on prior airplanes. So if you could, if you could update both on LRIP 5 where that stands today, and then also when you're looking at some of the technical challenges on the airplane such as the arresting hook, helmet-mounted display, could you give us an idea how some of that progress is going and when you expect a resolution of some of those issues?
Robert J. Stevens: Sure. I'll do my best, and you'll let us know if it's thorough enough, Doug. So when we last spoke, we had a very unique issue on LRIP 5, and it had to do with risks associated with concurrency costs. And the in -- at the time of our discussion, the formulation that we were reviewing from the government had a substantial risk transfer to industry, our company and our partners and our suppliers. Through negotiation and discussion that unfolded subsequent to the call, we negotiated the parameters associated with concurrency, and I would tell you, put it into a formulation that both we and the government felt was appropriate with regard to risk and execution, where we are accountable and they are accountable, and that's what partners do. So I think that matter is resolved. We are in the process of negotiating Lot 5 now. I don't have a time horizon where I can give you some assurance that negotiation will be complete, but we are leaning forward in an attempt to negotiate the final terms, conditions, pricing and provisions of Lot 5. Relative to some of the technical issues that you described, Doug, and I think a number of those over time were associated with the STOVL variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, I tell you we're making progress along each of the items that are identified. I think that progress was reflected in the 2011 performance of the program overall, certainly, the flight test program that ran a little bit ahead of schedule. I think most people would have noted that the STOVL variant was removed from probation after personal involvement by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. The Secretary visited the Pax River Naval Air Station. He spoke directly with the pilots and the maintainers and others familiar with the airplane. These are folks in the government, as well as folks in industry. I believe he went through a careful and detailed review, item by item and issue by issue. I must tell you I admire very much the personal level of due diligence from a person as busy as Secretary Panetta to get personally involved to understand the details. With that understanding, he removed the jet from probation. We know there are challenges. This is a development program. I've spoken to you as honestly and straightforwardly as I possibly can about our assessment of the development program. And I would tell you, this feels ordinary and traditional for complex airplanes of this type. It doesn't mean we're pleased when we have to modify an arresting hook or adapt a helmet-mounted display or work some thermal issues in the propulsion system. But these are observations that are the types that are relatively familiar with complex aeronautical systems like this. We've aligned our resources well. We've got great cooperation from the Naval Air Systems Command, from the Joint Program Office, from others in the government. Everyone is leaning forward. So when I tell you we had a better year on the Joint Strike Fighter, I don't mean we, Lockheed Martin. I mean, we, our partners, our suppliers, as well as all those in the government who support this effort, who understand the need. But what you will consistently hear is the underscoring of the criticality of having fifth-generation capabilities in this complex security environment. You heard that from Secretary Panetta today. You heard that from the President of the United States and Secretary Panetta when the new strategy was rolled out. We take that responsibility seriously. We have international partners who expect us to deliver on this program, and we will. We have an increasing number of foreign military sales participants, most recently, Japan, who can look at any airplane around the globe and pick the best airplane in which they have the most confidence that will meet their security demands. They selected the F-35. That's a huge honor and responsibility for the F-35 team. And finally, Larry Lawson's leadership on this program has simply been exceptional, and he is a very seasoned and skilled executive. He's built a lot of sophisticated airplanes, including the F-22. The team that he assembled -- has assembled is first-rate and we're ready for the challenges that we face. So I will tell you the momentum is in the program. Yes, there will be some quantity reductions. We've talked to you before about the new reality. This is part of the new reality where there are complex global security challenges and scarce resources available to governments to meet those security challenges. We'll make the adaptations. We'll incorporate the new quantities once we understand their time phasing. We will drive hard to have a successful, effective, affordable program.
Operator: And next on the line, we have Rich Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard Tobie Safran - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I wanted to ask a question on your backlog. So taking a look at your book to bill was pretty hefty, 1.6x this quarter. You finished the year greater than 1x as you said last year. Following last year's greater than 1x book to bill. Not meaning to sound like someone who's saying what have you done for me lately, just wanted to know if you could comment on the opportunity set for 2012. What's your view on 2012 book to bill? And what I'd really like to get a sense of is do you feel -- do you kind of feel that book to bill has peaked in 2011 or do you see an ability to repeat that this year?
Bruce L. Tanner: Hey, Rich, I'll take that one also. Hey, I was looking at this actually recently, we kind of did a review of the plan for 2012 and the outyear look as well. The thing that struck me as I was looking at that is there's not just a large number of I'll say high dollar awards in the first quarter or practically for that matter, in the first half of 2012. So what I think we're going to see, at least in the first half of the year, is some reduction in that backlog. So our book to bill will be lower than 1.0. I'm trying to think off the top of my head some of the larger orders we have in the first quarter, but things like the fiscal year '12 F-22 sustainment contract as one example. The authorization under a UCA in all likelihood of the F-35, LRIP 6 contract, and some international sales within Aero, perhaps for some C-130s might be highest dollar items in the first half of the year. I think we will likely have greater than 1 point. At least as we sit here today we'll likely have greater than 1.0 book to bill in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, a little bit different maybe than years past, which has always historically been our lowest quarter of the year from an orders perspective, and we've always dropped backlog more in the third quarter than any other quarter. I think that might change somewhat at least as we see here today that the third quarter will actually see some backlog growth. And I'm hoping, Rich, that by the end of the year, I think we might see some slight reduction. But I'd like to think we can be around the $80 billion mark for the year. And I don't think that's -- I guess that's a stretch goal I'd like to have for ourselves to kind of keep the backlog starting in the 80s. That's not a slam dunk by any stretch, but that's, again as we sit here today, that's the way I think about it, Rich.
Operator: And next on the line, we have Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Bob, 2 questions for you. One simple and the other more big picture. First, when do you get to rate on the F-35? And the second question is can you talk about the state of IR&D? The DoD doesn't seem to be clear about where their R&D priorities are going to be beyond bomber? So where does your IR&D future look like since DoD may be a less reliable source of R&D going forward?
Robert J. Stevens: Yes, thanks, Heidi. On both of these fronts, the answer has gone a little -- it would be a little bit, we're going to have to wait and see. For example, rate on the F-35 is going to be function of we think of new quantity adjustments that will phase out. I'll give you our best understanding today. Phase out of the nearer-term lots, some of the build cycle probably more or less leveling the quantities at around 30. Again, we'll look for the detail, and then accelerating out of there. I think in conjunction with that, Heidi, our understanding today is that the total quantity to be procured domestically remains at 2,443. So we're looking at a phasing, the phasing will have dual advantages of lowering the budget demands, aligning to fiscal pressures, as well as creating some time for the maturation of the airplane that might minimize some of the revisions to the configuration. Both of those things we think makes sense. I think the other aspect of rate or volume at least in the near term, we will, in the very short term, get some clarity and insight as to the U.S. government's buy plan. And we'd like to anchor that as a foundation. And then revisit with each of our international partners and each of our potential foreign military sales customers not just those who are already on board the program like Israel or Japan, but maybe future purchasers like South Korea where there is a tender and others, and begin to then build this revised acceleration plan that will lead to rate so that we can do that in the most efficient and effective way possible. So I think that's about the best summary of F-35 volume over time to rate that we have today. And we'll get you some more details when they're available to us. We continue to make investments internally in the areas that we think will be most relevant to the forces described in the strategy that was released. And I'll say it to you again, I think that our portfolio as defined in products and services, but also our portfolio of research and investigative initiatives aligns pretty well with the strategy that was described to the extent that we have those broad contours. For example, a number of years ago, we established, through this research and development facility, a cyber laboratory so that we could begin to much more thoroughly exercise the resilience in systems and the resilience in networks. So I think some of our actions there have aligned very well. I think the future of the overall portfolio and I very much resonate to the spirit of your question in an era of more fiscal austerity. How will the apportionment of the top line budget reduction flow between and among expense accounts like operations and maintenance and personnel and the investment accounts of procurement and research and development? And how will resources available for research be thrifted? So that's sort of an open watch item for us because we don't want to see an attrition in our engineering facility. We don't want to lose some of the innovative expertise that is fueled by access to this type of funding. And here again, I think the best we can do is look for the details over time, but we're not in possession of today and maybe, be sure to follow on with you in that regard.
Operator: And next on the line, we have Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So on the F-35, looking through your commentary, it looks like revenues last year were down about -- were up about $700 million on both parts of the program, and profits may be off $35 million, so the margin's off may be 1 point. Could you give us any sense now that you seem to have the concurrency issues resolved? Do we have any opportunity on margins this year -- or excuse me, moving into the future?
Bruce L. Tanner: Hey, Cai, it's Bruce. I'll take that one on. Look, without commenting on your math, your math is usually pretty accurate. But without commenting on it, the way I'd look at 2012, let's start with the revenue on the F-35 program. I think the F-35 LRIP contracts are growing somewhere in the 9-ish to 10% range year-over-year. So we're still seeing some good growth there. That's being offset because the development contract, the SDD contract, is going down compared to 2011 as you might expect. I think net-net, the F-35 is up some mid-single digits growth year-over-year. As to your question on margins, I would expect us to see some margin improvement on the F-35 in 2012, primarily because if you just sit back and think about what we're going to accomplish in the year, we're going to deliver a lot more aircraft this year. We're going to deliver, and I'm quoting this from memory here. We're going to deliver all the LRIP 2 aircraft, all the LRIP 3 aircraft and a good portion of the LRIP 4 aircraft all in 2012. And so as you might expect, we have a historical practice of not booking from a booking rate perspective at the at-completion position or as we expect the programs to run at their end or at their completion until we've retired the risk on those contracts. And so as you might expect, we've got some risk retirement that we're expecting to become finalized with the final delivery of those aircraft. And again, because a good chunk of those 3 LRIPs are all finishing in 2012, we would expect to see some margin improvement compared to 2011 for the F-35.
Operator: And next on the line, we have Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee & Leach.
Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just a question on capital deployment. You guys have been setting the standard amongst your peers in terms of dividends and buybacks. I wanted -- how are you approaching it going forward now that we kind of have pretty good feel directionally, where the budgets are going to be and potentially a lot of moving parts amongst your peers when you weigh that against a selective M&A? How are you looking at that in terms of going forward on the strategy?
Robert J. Stevens: Well, with -- in today's environment, we're looking at cash deployment pretty much the same the way we have been, and we're not communicating with you any change in strategy or philosophy because I think you know that the first thing we do is start by getting the cash. And I don't say that lightly, but we have a very rigorous focused and disciplined process here that is institutionalized around the company that cash management matters a great deal relative to our ability to both make appropriate internal investments and then return appropriate value to shareholders. So we're rigorously focused on that, and we like the balanced cash deployment approach we have that you highlighted, a component for share repurchases and a component for dividends. We spent a lot of time talking with the investors in the company to make sure that we understand your sense about how we ought to be thinking about cash deployment, but I don't think you should expect a change in our approach.
Bruce L. Tanner: Peter, this is Bruce. I don't think I said in my remarks, but I'll say it here because it relates to your question, obviously. The guidance that we provided for 2012 assumes that we're going to have at least $1 billion of share repurchases contained within the earnings per share number that we gave you. And I think that's the at least some indication that we're going to continue the practices that we've done and demonstrated in the last few years.
Operator: And next on the line, we have Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just for Bruce, a quick clarification on your comments around the Aeronautics margin and then a question about long-term pension funding. On the margin, back to what you were talking about on the F-35 and your sort of historical behavior pattern on EACs and risk retirement around the end of a contract, as you look to the end of the F-22, should we be expecting anything that kind of intra-year quarterly patterns of margin in Aeronautics that's worth noting in 1 quarter versus some of the others? And then secondly, you provided some commentary around pension funding. Obviously, that's in the guidance in 2012. I just wondered if you might give us some color on how that stands where we are today for 2013 and beyond.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes. Thanks Carter. So let's say, I'll start with the sort of the F-22 question, would you see the same thing that we described. I think that was your question as we saw or as I commented on the F-35. I think there's 8 aircraft left to deliver on the F-22 production program. All of them have literally left the factory, and they're sitting in what we call our flight line operations going through, as you might expect, flight testing both with our pilots and with the government pilots. So there's not a lot of -- frankly, there's not a lot of cost left to do on those aircraft. Again, they are all built, at this point in time, they were finished last year. So most of the risk retirement that you would associate with the end of the program occurred in the 2011 time frame, not the 2012 time frame. So while there might be some opportunities for improvement, I wouldn't expect it to be as substantial, for instance, as we saw in 2011. Longer-term pension funding, again, we accelerated $1 billion of the required payments from 2012 into 2011. As we look for and I think you're probably aware of the CAS Harmonization rules were recently passed or implemented. I think they're actually effective not until next month, but I think the notification came out at the end of December of last year. We should see cash recovery rise in the next few years, but the actual payments from the ERISA perspective looking into from 2012 into 2013, I think we're paying now about $1.1 billion in 2012. That number grows to about $2.1 billion in 2013. The flip side of that is the CAS recoveries about $1.1 billion. So think of that as being sort of a breakeven position. CAS risk -- excuse me, risk of payments out and CAS recoveries in for 2012. The CAS recovery in '13 is more like $1.4 billion. So we're getting some of the benefit of the CAS Harmonization, but not much. ERISA payments are probably at similar level in the year after and the CAS recovery grows some beyond that. So slow recovery I'll say it back to -- sort of getting back to a breakeven position, primarily because the CAS Harmonization got pushed out further than we had expected when we started first talking about CAS Harmonization. That's still expecting in the not-too-distant future for that to get close to breakeven, then start to flip the other way around where we're getting more collections than payouts.
Operator: And next on the line, we have Joe Nadol with JPMorgan Securities.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Bob, on the capital deployment front, you have made maybe a subtle shift in the strategy or maybe it's just the timing, but you've done a couple of acquisitions here in the fourth quarter that were -- they weren't huge, but they were bigger than certainly than you've been doing. You've also over the last year or so divested a couple of the deals that you had done a few years ago. And I think all 4 of these acquisitions, I'm including the -- or all 4 of these deals, I'm talking about the 2 acquisitions you made in the fourth quarter as well as Savi and PAE, they're in adjacencies. So I was wondering if you could maybe characterize big picture how you're viewing acquisitions in adjacencies? And then maybe a little bit on each of the deals and why you decided to divest Savi and then acquire these other 2?
Robert J. Stevens: Sure, I'll be happy to, Joe. I think that we are -- you mentioned timing here. I think that's maybe a little bit of timing. We've had a-string-of-pearls approach. We like that approach. We look for companies that give us access to markets, unique technology, they provide a good fit, they have some ease of integration and they meet our overall test for valuations. I think the acquisitions you're referring to were Sim-Industries and QTC. They are part of an adjacent market strategy that we've had in place for a number of years now. We are certainly interested in moving this business forward in the technology areas that we think customers will increasingly value and in areas where we can back up some synergies. If you think of Sim-Industries in the market for simulators, we've been in the simulator business for a long time. This extends our portfolio. We're not unwilling to take that portfolio beyond our traditional customer sets to bring in some of those business practices into our core business. We think there is real synergy there. We'll continue to explore for businesses that fit our portfolio, fit our business model and that will now align with the contours of this new National Security Strategy and the portfolio we've put in place. So to the extent that there would be a business that would provide for us international opportunities, we will certainly look at that. With regard to the cyber domain, I think there'll be a continuing and even growing demand for capabilities in that regard. Our Systems Integration businesses is always one that we'd like to reinforce and support. And certainly the emerging field of energy and here, we're going to be selective because one size isn't going to fit all. But we do have some interest in the energy domain as well as others. I think there'll be some opportunities unfolding as we see the details in the budget domestically and maybe get a better feel for how our global customers respond, perhaps, in logistics and sustainability and support. If long-term budgets are going to be under pressure, yet operational tempos are going to remain high. If we're going to have deployments to Asia-Pacific, in the Middle East, if we're going to find innovative ways to move forces around, we think there'll be roles in our logistics business, in our support and our supply businesses there. So if there were acquisition opportunities there, we would look. We've been prudent, I think, as good stewards of the hard-earned cash position that we have. We want to maintain good credit quality. We have firepower, that financial flexibility, I think, is a discriminator of our company along with our portfolio and our selectivity about what we buy and what we do with it. In the case of the divestitures, if there are changes in the market, changes in the customers' behavior, we are not going to keep businesses that don't align with the overall strategic arc and trajectory of this businesses, and we'll be decisive. So I think on the acquisition side we want to be selective so that we're not talking to you in the future about a lot of divestitures. But in a case where circumstances change, we're going to face the reality, deal with those changes and move the business forward. In doing so, we'll try to generate as much value as we can and share that value with investors to the best of our ability.
Operator: And next on the line, we have George Shapiro with Access 3:42.
George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC: This is for Bruce. If you take a look at Aeronautics, you disclosed this quarter that you had risk retirement of $70 million on the F-16, and another $35 million on the C-130 and C-5, and together, it's maybe 270 basis points addition to the margin. Can you just describe what they were actually related to and what the opportunity is for getting more of those next year? And is there any way we can kind of anticipate some of those coming? And then one other one in that area. The F-35 profit margin is clearly implied to be down in this quarter based on your commentary. I just want to validate that, that's probably LRIP 4 being booked in higher revenues and a lower margin that's kind of swamping your overall numbers, and there wasn't any change in any of the other program margins.
Bruce L. Tanner: Okay, let me start, George, with the first question, the F-16 step-ups and the C-130 what drove them and what's out there for next year and what should you be looking for. The F-16 we've -- I'll say a lot of that was sort of ordinary run-of-the-mill program execution, clicking off performance milestones and retiring risk accordingly. There was on one of our international contracts, a particular item that we were tracking towards that we actually reached closure on in the fourth quarter that we felt justified a step up. So that particular item, which was -- I'm trying to think off the top of my head, George, that was a pretty good chunk, probably 1/2 or so of the F-16 pick-up, that will likely not repeat next year on the F-16 program. The C-130 program is again just sort of the clicking off the normal manufacturing activities. The only thing that was a little bit unusual on the C-130 is we had a really, really good performance on the sustainment contracts on the C-130 activities in the quarter. And I'd like to think that we have the opportunity to do that in 2012 as well. We're -- I think we've really hit a stride where customers are seeing great value in the sustainment support that we are providing those, particularly obviously, the international customers is where that -- most of that happens. And I'd like to think that, that was -- be something that you'll continue to see in 2012 as well. As far as the F-35 profit margins are concerned, I mean, there was no -- and I'm doing this again from the top of my head, that there was no profit adjustments upwardly or downwardly in the quarter. So any margin change that happened was purely volume related. We are starting to get some heavier activity in the LRIP 4 contract as you described in your question. And that's again because as I said earlier LRIP 2, 3 and part of 4 will start delivering this year. So that volume is starting to come in, and some of that margin improvement that we're looking for in 2012 will be on contracts such as LRIP 4 as we start to see production aircraft roll-off the line as we anticipate. That will be the triggering mechanism, if you will, for the risk retirements that we plan.
Operator: And next on the line, we have Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just going back to the cash flow outlook for next year at $2.8 billion on the op cash line. Bruce, a couple of things. One, the pension expense after-tax looks like it's a $750 million tailwind or so, maybe a little bit less than that. And then is there anything outside of maybe advances or cash taxes, are those the 2 major downers to the cash in 2012? It just seems like even your usual 10%, 15% conservatism, this would be a bit lighter than you might otherwise have given the tailwind on lower pension contributions?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, hey Myles, let me -- just to clarify what I think I heard. I think you said $2.8 billion in operating cash in 2012, it's $3.8 billion for the year. And if your questions, again, when there was -- again there were a lot of receipts that got pulled into 2011 from 2012, including some fairly good-sized international receipts. And that's one of the things that enabled us to do the $1 billion acceleration of the pension plan. So we're actually ahead of the game. In fact, for the first time in the corporation's history, at least as I look back in the records, we actually have negative working capital at the working -- at the corporation level. So that's hard to replicate, and one of the reasons that you'll see are -- that your calculation from balance sheet perspective, that's the heart of your question. It's because you're seeing some of the work-off, if you will, that negative working capital coming back next year. I'd like to think even having said that, there are still opportunities. I can tell you, if you talk to any of my folks in the finance organization working in the 4 business areas, they will tell you that I am pushing hard to do better on cash flow than what we've committed to here. And I think there are opportunities to do that, but we're just not there at this point in time to change the guidance accordingly. We'll, obviously, give you updates throughout the year as we progress, and we'll come back to you and tell you how we're doing on that challenge.
Operator: Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies & Company.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Bob, you were very successful in placing THAAD in UAE. Are there a couple more opportunities for this? And might you also address some international potential?
Robert J. Stevens: Yes, thanks, Howard. I'll tell you that relative to the THAAD in the UAE program, you know that Chris Kubasik hadn't been on the calls because he went out and got a real job as our Chief Operating Officer. And he'd been doing an excellent job in focusing on the execution of programs like THAAD, as well as assuring that we're listening carefully to the needs of customers. When we look at the Middle East and you start with an assessment of the security climate there, I think many people look at the Iranians with respect to their actions and their intentions even in the most recent discussions about prospect of closing the Straits of Hormuz, and it creates a very high level of tension. And people recognize that they have invested in the kind of technologies that include ballistic missile threats, and therefore, many in the region who have population centers, who have oil production centers, who have strategic areas of interest view missile defense as a very critical system. So that as we look at the National Security Strategy that was outlined by the President -- the Secretary when they talked about increasing security cooperation partnerships movement as you highlighted by United Arab Emirates here with THAAD, I think if you look across the -- generally, the Gulf Coordinating Council regions, you would see I think a similar level of threat and risk and a similar desire on the part of our administration to lean forward. Now you know we follow a very discreet process here that starts with government-to-government discussions. First, and nothing that we would say or do would subvert that process. But in the longer term, I suspect there'll be heightened and continued interest. I think that those interests will be viewed favorably by our government, and I think we'll have a maturing portfolio in the Middle East with regard to missile defense. I think there'll be a similar version of that experience throughout the Asia-Pacific theater, because we're watching the same or similar type of overall security risk, the proliferation of technologies, the desire to get missiles of greater performance, longer range, more precision, and the desire for governments to have some protection against that ballistic missile threat. So I think this segment of our portfolio is one that will likely grow internationally. Our focus is on making sure that we're executing the requirements under the contract that the technology stays robust. And there was a question earlier about research and development or how are you investing, well, we want to make sure that we have resources available to think in terms of next-generation technology and how can we adapt, how can we provide adjuncts to this system. Maybe it's greater range, maybe it's greater payload. But to continue to evolve these systems, and we think that's a very smart way to address the demands in the global security environment. Of course, you need a mature portfolio to start with before you can evolve that portfolio as the dynamics in the global security environment unfold themselves and we can address them. And I'm very pleased that we have the kind of portfolio you mentioned that we have it in Aegis, we have it in PAC-3. In our missile defense portfolio that forms a really good basis where some incremental investment could not only satisfy customer needs today, but satisfy them tomorrow and can enable us to adapt the system for regional demands around the globe.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS Securities.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a couple of little things. Bruce, I don't think you specifically said the tax rate you're looking for, for 2012. And then back on F-35 in terms of the mix, could you maybe breakout percentage-wise on the production side how much of the revenue base you think in 2012 will be LRIP 2 aircraft versus 3 versus 4?
Bruce L. Tanner: I'll answer the easy one first, David. Tax rate for 2012 is -- right now, we're looking at about 30%. That excludes, obviously, the effects of the R&D tax credit. But for planning purposes, think about 30%. Relative to your question on the split of the LRIPs, I'll remind you this is a contract that we’re -- the LRIP contracts themselves are contracts that were booking on a percentage-of-completion basis. So there's very little cost, I'll say, for the LRIP 2 aircraft relative to -- it is not proportional to taking simply LRIP 2 aircraft divide it by the total, because those -- the cost to build those aircraft similar to what I was describing on the F-22 program are kind of behind us. They're out of the factory. They're going through flight testing and the like, and so it's difficult to parse that out. Off the top of my head, I'll say for the total LRIP activity, that's heavily, heavily dominated by LRIP 3 and LRIP 4 activity, which you would probably expect in 2011, and that will shift over in 2012 to the LRIP 4 and LRIP 5 and a similar pattern all the way through future years.
Robert J. Stevens: Jovan, let me say thank you for your help today. We're going to take our increasingly mature portfolio of relevant global systems, focus on the needs of our customers in addressing global challenges, and we look forward to updating you with our progress next quarter. Thank you, all, very much for tuning in on the call today. Again, Jovan, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference today. Please have a great evening.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry F. Kircher: Thank you, Karen. And good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Stevens: Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks again for joining us today. In the third quarter, we continued the positive momentum we've been driving since the beginning of the year. We achieved sales growth of 7%, while growing earnings per share from continuing operations by 30%. We generated over $500 million in cash from operations, utilized our strong cash position to repurchase a record level of 13.4 million shares and made dividend payments of $246 million.  Additionally, our Board of Directors approved both an increase of 33% to our quarterly dividend, bringing the full-year dividend payout to $4 a share and an additional share repurchase authorization of $3.5 billion for opportunistic share repurchases. Our sound year-to-date performance has also enabled us to increase our full-year guidance for earnings per share.  Since we were last together in July, both the global security environment and world economic conditions have remained volatile. Domestically, the environment remains fluid, driven principally by the ongoing deliberations on potential reductions to federal budget levels. The recently enacted Budget Control Act of 2011 increased the federal government's borrowing limit, while reducing projected government spending over the next 10 years. It also established the bipartisan congressional joint select committee on deficit reduction, sometimes referred to as the super committee with a debt panel, which is charged with recommending legislation by November 23. The enactment of which would result in spending and revenue changes that would reduce net government spending by at least $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years.  If the super committee fails to recommend legislation or the Congress fails to approve that legislation by December 23, or the President fails to sign that legislation into law, then an automatic sequestration process would be triggered, which would make up any shortfall necessary to achieve the $1.2 trillion target. Under the budget act, 50% of any shortfall would automatically be applied as a reduction to the discretionary appropriations for national defense programs and 50% to other domestic programs commencing in 2013.  We certainly want this committee to be successful. We understand the urgency of reducing trillion dollar annual budget deficits and our $14 trillion national debt. But we also feel strongly that the defense department is already working on nearly $0.5 trillion in reductions, which is very significant, and that resources for national security should be aligned with our nation's strategy to meet global challenges and not a function of automatic budget triggers.  Looking at the current FY '12 DoD budget, Congress passed a continuing resolution that is in effect through November 18. Committees in both the Senate and the House are assessing the President's initial budget request of $553 billion for the base DoD budget and $118 billion for the overseas contingency operations budget. As budget deliberations evolve, we are very focused on the drive for greater efficiency and execution across the corporation.  This quarter, we implemented additional staffing reductions in Information Systems & Global Solutions and at corporate headquarters. While these staffing reductions are very painful, they're essential in responding to changing economic conditions and new realities. We know the demands on our customers are great, and they are being asked to do more with less on a daily basis. It's imperative that we respond to this environment as effectively as possible.  On the international front, we continue to see a varied picture of markets and regions. In the Middle East and Pacific Rim, we believe interest in our products will likely remain strong in areas like missile defense, fighter and cargo aircraft, command and control capabilities, sensors and other systems. The outlook is much more uncertain in the Eurozone with large national debt levels, low economic prospects and high unemployment.  Despite domestic and international pressures, our overall portfolio of products and services is well positioned to provide solutions in support of critical national security missions for our nation and for our allies.  Turning to operations. Let me cover some events this quarter, starting with the F-35, where we continue to make solid progress in development and production. On the development program, flight test activities continued ahead of plan. Through September year-to-date, we were 9% ahead on test flights and 10% ahead on test points.  To update you through yesterday's performance, we have completed 803 flights and 6,287 test points, which means that with 83% of the year done, we have accomplished 92% of this year's planned flights, that's 872 in total, and 95% of this year's planned test points, that's 6,622 by year's end. We completed static structural testing slightly ahead of schedule, which was an important series of tests as they verify the structural integrity of the airframe.  Progress was also made on the carrier variant aircraft during the evaluation of carrier suitability at Lakehurst, New Jersey. The team successfully completed Jet Blast Deflector testing and the first steam catapult launch of the aircraft with 59 catapult launches completed to date. This testing also revealed that additional work will be needed on the arresting hook to reduce bounce and a thorough design of performance review is now underway.  Testing will continue through the balance of the year as we prepare for shipboard testing in 2013. The steel hull aircraft continues to show improved reliability and performance with over 250 vertical landings achieved year-to-date. Beyond the quarter, on October 3, the STOVL aircraft successfully executed a vertical landing on the deck of the USS Wasp, the first vertical landing at sea marking the beginning of sea trials testing for the STOVL variant.  In total, 72 short takeoffs and vertical landings were completed over 19 days, and flying qualities, environmental effects and initial deck and hangar operations, including taxi, towing, tie down, refueling and elevator operations were all evaluated, with all initial sea trial objectives being met. I want to offer a special thanks to all those on the government team, especially all those aboard the USS Wasp, for the dedication and professionalism that enabled these tests to be completed on schedule.  The software development activities on the program continue to progress with software release 1-B flying today, it's performing well with good stability and functionality. Follow-on releases with enhanced functionality are in various stages of development, including integration lab tests, initial system integration and requirements definition.  Overall, the software program continues to have approximately 2 months schedule pressure and we're applying resources to recover schedule and mitigate impacts.  On F-35 production, working with our partners and suppliers, we're seeing greater cycling of the production line. Year-to-date we delivered 8 aircraft under our LRIP 2 contract. 4 of the 5 airplanes delivered this quarter were provided to Eglin Air Force Base to be used for training pilots and maintainers at the F-35 integrated training center in Florida.  We now have 55 aircraft in backlog for Production Lots 2 through 4. On the international front, our 8 international partners continue to support the program and we see expanding interest in the F-35. For example, this quarter we were pleased to submit a proposal for the F-35 to Japan under their F-X competition and look forward to potential interest from the government of South Korea.  I also wanted to provide an update on our Lot 5 negotiations. You may recall that we received Long-lead funding from the government for Lot 5 in July 2010. That Long-lead funding was exhausted in February of this year and we requested additional funding from the government, which has not yet been provided.  We've continued to work on the program to ensure production continuity, so that we could protect the government schedule and so that we and our suppliers could collectively remain focused on cost-effective execution, while we secured additional funding and work to negotiate the Lot 5 contract. As a result, the termination liability at the end of our third quarter was about $750 million. As we requested funding to cover termination liability and fund our supplier base on Lot 5, we were advised by the government earlier this month that the funding for Lot 5 that was appropriated by the Congress in April would now be contingent on our company assuming a new and unprecedented contract provision known as a concurrency clause.  Since this is a new requirement and a potentially unfamiliar one, let me take a moment to offer some background in perspective. For decades, our nation has provided for its security by focusing on technological superiority rather than numerical superiority. This is proven to be a very successful strategy resulting in the most capable military to ever take the field. To accomplish this strategy, industry has asked to stretch the boundaries of science and technology to create capabilities that simply have not existed before like a fifth-generation, net-enabled, stealthy supersonic fighter that hovers.  At the state of the art today, it's broadly recognized that neither industry nor government possesses the analytical capabilities to predict exactly how these complex and sophisticated systems will behave when subjected to the extraordinarily demanding environments our customers must confront. And that is precisely why we have extensive and rigorous test programs to discover those aspects of performance that we all know are unknown at the time of design.  The term concurrency describes an element of a government acquisition strategy. It results when the government calls for the start of Low-Rate Initial Production, while the development and test activities are ongoing. This approach has been a common practice when building air [ph] vehicles for the military as it's designed to accelerate deliveries while lowering total cost.  Balancing the potential cost of incorporating changes from the discovery of unknowns in the test program with the cost reduction opportunities associated with more volume and earlier periods provides for more effective learning curves and the replacement of older aircraft sooner, which is of value to the government. For Lot 5, the government has stated that in order to obtain additional funding, the industry team would need to accept a concurrency clause including a cost-sharing element.  For discoveries that are known, that is, those that have already been made during tests, this concept may be workable, as we, our partners and our suppliers do stand behind our performance as evidenced by our assuming the fixed-price type contract in Lot 4. This concept breaks down, however, when extended to cover the unknown, that is discoveries that might occur in the future but are not known and cannot be predicted today.  So we and our partners and suppliers need to explore this concept in greater detail to arrive at a fair and equitable cost share for concurrency changes. We're also awaiting the results of the government's should cost analysis and have our first meeting scheduled for next week.  To summarize the status on Lot 5, then, we need to secure funding without delay and believe that funding should not be conditioned on a concurrency clause or any other clause and we should commence the negotiation of Lot 5 including all clauses and provisions as soon as we possibly can. We would very much like to have the Lot 5 negotiation completed by the end of the year.  Moving to the C-130J program, our team delivered 13 aircraft in the quarter and is on track to achieve the increased production deliveries of 33 aircraft that we outlined for you at the start of this year. With a backlog of 81 aircraft and robust domestic and international demand, the C-130J line continues to be a strong contributor to our corporate portfolio.  On the F-16 program, the government of Iraq signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 18 new F-16 fighters with a future sales value of approximately $3 billion. We will be working with Iraq to finalize the contract as soon as possible. Finalization of this award will add to the existing F-16 backlog of 55 aircraft and extend the production line to 2015.  Moving to Electronic Systems. In the expanding area of ballistic missile defense, our team supported the United States Army's flight test of our Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System or THAAD and its successful intercept of 2 different simultaneous targets. This test was the first of the initial operational test and evaluation flights and challenged the THAAD System to track, detect and intercept 2 different targets utilizing 2 THAAD interceptors, making a first for the system. Congratulations to the U.S. Army on their very successful use of this capability and a significant thank you to the Missile Defense Agency for the confidence invested in the THAAD team.  Since 2005, the THAAD System has successfully performed 9 of 9 intercepts, demonstrating the maturity of the program. Production is ongoing to provide additional missile batteries to the United States Army and international interest in the program is strong with an inaugural international award from the United Arab Emirates is expected in the near future.  On LCS, our team began construction of our third ship known as LCS 5, which will be the future USS Milwaukee. We've planned delivery to the United States Navy in 2014. LCS 5 is the first of 10 Freedom Class ships awarded to us by the Navy last December. Our second LCS ship, known as the Fort Worth or LCS 3 put to sea for the first time and began builder sea trials that's focused on operational testing of the vessel's navigation and power systems.  Following the completion of the builder sea trials, the ship will undergo acceptance trials later this fall conducted by the Navy. LCS 3 remains on cost and on schedule for delivery to the fleet in 2012. With good performance and growing international interest, we believe this program offers the potential for future growth.  In Information Systems & Global Solutions, we've provided a significant software upgrade to the air traffic control system at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control facility, which has responsibility for the nation's second busiest airspace. This software enables the use of GPS technology to help direct air traffic and provide an improved picture of the airspace.  And in Space Systems, 2 critical mission success events were achieved this quarter for NASA. The first was the launch of the Juno spacecraft that will arrive at Jupiter in 2016 with the goal of studying the planet's structure, atmosphere and magnetosphere. And the second was the launch of the twin robotic grill spacecraft to the Earth's moon to map the gravitational field.  Data obtained will determine the structure of the lunar interior from crust to core and expand our knowledge of the thermal evolution of the moon.  Before turning the call over to Bruce, I wanted to comment on 3 additional items from the quarter. I was particularly pleased to see that our corporation was recognized by the Carbon Disclosure Project as one of the top 25 companies worldwide for our efforts to analyze our carbon footprint and identify ways to achieve reductions.  Our investments in energy efficiency are helping improve the sustainability of our products and operations, while also reducing infrastructure costs. Our Go Green culture is driving an innovation of environmental stewardship that provides benefits for our businesses, our customers and the communities where we live and work. In the October 17 edition of Fortune magazine, we were very proud to see our colleagues Marilyn Hewson, Linda Gooden and Joanne Maguire and our board member, Ross Brewer, all included among the 50 most powerful women in business.  As we say around here, when you possess the situational awareness, information dominance and precision engagement that they do, this is no surprise. Sincere congratulations to each of them on a very well-deserved recognition. And, finally this quarter, I established the executive office of the chairman to include myself and our President and Chief Operating officer, Chris Kubasik. This office was created to enhance the corporation's responsiveness, agility and performance in an increasingly complex business environment.  As members of the executive office, Chris and I will act promptly to address and resolve operational and functional issues as they arise. The expansion of Chris's responsibility demonstrates the confidence that I and the board have in his ability, his vision and his leadership. I'll turn the call over to Bruce now to provide some additional detail on the third quarter financial results, our outlook for 2011 and some directional perspectives for 2012. And then open the lines for discussion, and I think we'll try to add back some time here at the back end because there's a lot to cover in the business today. So I'll turn the call over to Bruce now.
Bruce L. Tanner: Thank you, Bob. And good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our third quarter. We grew sales for the company by a strong 7% driven by growth in Aeronautics and Space Systems.  Our earnings per share from continuing operations grew by 30% compared to last year, driven by higher sales volume and segment margins, and as a reminder, last year's third quarter included the charge from our VESP program. We generated over $500 million in cash from operations bringing our year-to-date total to more than $3 billion. We repurchased over 13 million shares and increased our quarterly dividend by 33% to an annualized dividend of $4 per share. So, overall, we had another strong quarter.  On Chart 4, we'll look at sales on the 4 business areas. 3 of the 4 business areas grew sales in the quarter. Aeronautics' growth was driven primarily by the delivery of 13 C-130s this quarter compared with 7 deliveries in the third quarter of 2010. Higher sales for the F-35 LRIP programs and a C-5 delivery this quarter versus none in the third quarter of 2010 round out the increases. Space had higher sales due to the delivery of a commercial satellite in the quarter, while none occurred in 2010.  Electronic Systems' sales growth was driven by air defense sales at Missiles & Fire Control and the soft CLS program sales increases in Global Training & Logistics. IS&GS experienced a decrease in sales, primarily due to the absence of the U.S. Census activity this year compared with $115 million in sales for that program in the third quarter of last year.  Turning to Chart 5 and our earnings per share in the quarter. Our earnings per share from continuing operations grew 30% over last year's level. And our pension adjusted earnings per share grew by more than 40% as shown on the chart after adding back the negative effect of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment in both periods.  As I said earlier, this EPS growth was driven by the higher sales volume, a slight improvement in segment operating margin and last year's VESP charge being significantly greater than this quarter's severance charge for reductions in both IS&GS and the corporate office.  On Chart 6, we'll further describe our cash from operations in the quarter. This quarter's results were similar to last year's, both in the operating cash and the level of pension contributions and we remain on track to generate at least $4.2 billion this year.  Staying with cash on Chart 7, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to the shareholders. $3 billion returned through dividends or repurchases versus $2.6 billion in free cash flow.  On Chart 8, we'll discuss our share repurchase activity in more detail.  During the quarter, we repurchased 13.4 million shares, which represents the highest number of shares we've ever repurchased in a quarter. That brings our year-to-date number of shares repurchased to just under 30 million. And if you look on Chart 9, you can see that we've already matched the highest annual percentage reduction and share count through just the first 3 quarters of this year.  Chart 10 shows the significant increases in our quarterly dividend amount over time to the current level of $1 per share, resulting in an annualized yield in excess of 5%.  On Chart 11, we have our current earnings per share outlook for the year. We increased both the low end and the high end of the earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.05 as a result of a $25 million increase in segment operating profit for the number of other items that offset one another.  On Chart 12, I want to provide some insight into what we are expecting as we look toward 2012. Of course, we'll provide more detailed guidance on the January call, but we wanted to at least provide you with the trends we're seeing today. We expect sales at the top line to be flattish compared to 2011. That difference from our previous discussions about long-term sales growth primarily in the Aeronautics business area. Aero will likely see flat to slight growth compared with 2011 as a result of establishing the final baseline of the F-35 development contract, which occurred this quarter.  Error of quantity changes, the phasing of F-16 deliveries from 2012 to 2013 to bridge the production line and avoid a gap and the effects of our cost reduction activities. Electronic Systems also will likely see flat to slight growth while Space Systems should remain relatively similar to 2011 sales.  IS&GS should have a slight decline in sales probably in the mid-single-digit range as the government IT market continues to face budget pressure. Segment operating margins, on the other hand, should remain at around 11% versus the mid-10% range we have previously described. Most of the improved margin is projected in Aeronautics, reflecting both the lower F-35 volume and the rephasing of the development program and the impacts of cost reductions on our price backlog. Operating cash flow should be impacted by higher than expected pension contributions in 2012 compared with 2011. 2012 funding is expected to be some $800 million higher than what we are funding in 2011 but cash flow from the core pensions should be consistent with this year's levels. And our estimated FAS/CAS pension adjustment should be higher than previously discussed as described on the next chart.  Chart 13 shows the potential changes for our FAS/CAS estimate from previous estimates. As you can see, our 2012 FAS/CAS adjustment could be comparable to the 2011 adjustment of $925 million, which is substantially higher than the $200 million estimate I provided in January. We use the notional 4.5% discount rate, reflecting the significantly lower rate environment since the end of last year. The discount rate change accounts for about 2/3 of the estimated increase in FAS/CAS for 2012. The remainder of the estimated increase is driven by our expectation that CAS privatization will move out of the 2012 time frame into the 2013 or 2014 time frame. And we will likely lower our long-term asset return assumptions to 8% from the current 8.5%, reflecting a slightly more conservative view of future market returns.  And, of course, our FAS/CAS adjustment will not be finalized until year end, when the discount rate and other factors are known.  Finally, on Chart 14, we have our summary. Overall we've had a strong year so far and we expect that the full year will follow suit. Some of the cost and proven actions we've been taking are favorably impacting our results this year as well as next year on our price business, and while 2012 is obviously dependent upon budgetary outcomes, we expect to have greater clarity to share with you on the January call. And with that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: On the Aeronautics, I really wanted to if -- I have 2 things in there. You'd said you had better margins because of F-22, C-130J. First, are those onetime improvements in margin due to those 2 programs? And then how do you think about F-35 margin going forward given the uncertainty around LRIP 5, the timing of the LRIP 5 agreement looking into next year?
Bruce L. Tanner: This is Bruce. I'll answer those 2, if that's okay. I think you're talking about the quarter for F-22 and C-130, are you not?
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: That's correct, yes.
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, for both those -- for F-22 and C-130, we did have some fairly good risk retirements in the quarter. In particular, for the F-22 I'll say that was probably larger than what we should be expecting going forward. Obviously, the production program runs out, I believe, in February of next year. So there may be some potential risk retirements along the way but I don't think it'll be as quite as large as the one we'd experienced in the third quarter of this year. For C-130, I'm trying to think, Doug. I'm not sure if we had large step-ups or risk retirements in the quarter or not. I think that was mostly volume driven for the most part, with maybe a little bit of improvement there. So I would say there was not anything in particular that happened in the third quarter that can't continue to happen going forward, if that makes sense. And in the last question I think you have was on F-35 profitability and what the prospects are relative to the LRIP 5 negotiation. I should remind you, I think that we booked the development contract as a standalone contract. We also booked each of the Production Lots, so LRIP 1, 2, 3 and 4 as standalone contracts. So the LRIP 5 negotiation will have literally no impact on the other contracts as far as bookings is concerned or margins are concerned. I would suggest that for LRIP 5, you would expect us to be appropriately conservative to start off on that program.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.
Richard Tobie Safran - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I just wanted to ask you about 2 programs, THAAD and F-16. I heard your comments about the test success. Congrats on that. Also on your comment about the outlook for THAAD, I just want to know, for the UAE, do you think that that's -- I know you said the order could come in the near future. Do you think that's something you could book in late 2011 or is that potentially a 2012 event? And also if you could maybe touch on any additional F-16 opportunities you see beyond the Iraq order you just got, if you expect that production will continue beyond 2014.
Bob Stevens: Yes, I'm happy to do that, Rich. I'll tell you that we have been working to secure the THAAD order. And I think our best judgment now is we're sort of right at the cusp of the end of '11 or early '12. And it's honestly just really hard to make that call based on all the knowledge we have. We think our discussions have been constructive and positive and headed in the right direction. I know you know that everyone here would much prefer a late '11 order to be sure. It's just treading right on the seam of the year. I will tell you we're especially appreciative of the work that's been done by the Missile Defense Agency, they've been very forward leaning here in working with both us and the Emiratis and they have facilitated a great pathway for us to follow here. So we don't see any impediments, I think it's just being workman-like in the final details here. On the F-16 program, we were pleased to see the Iraqis make progress. When we last talked about prospects for Iraq, we mentioned the deferral in the order and it's nice to see that deferral reversed. We're also, relative to future orders, looking at the prospects in Oman for 18 airplanes. And we'll continue to survey other countries to examine whether they have further interest in the F-16. With 18 airplanes, I think we'll certainly move out beyond 2015 or so on the production line. You may recall that we actually rephased the production flow on the F-16 line, lowering near-term production volumes so that we would have a better opportunity to smooth the production flow that would enable or enhance the ability to secure our future orders. We thought that was an action undertaken that would generate greater additional value in the future, so we have done that. And then there'll be some opportunities with the administration's decision in Taiwan to modify a number of their existing F-16 aircraft. And there is, even though this current round of discussions did not result in the sale of new airplanes, the goal of security environment remains sufficiently volatile that we don't really know what the future has and that's why we want to keep the line as vibrant as we can and ready to assess any contingencies when they arise.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just wanted to, I guess, confirm that the FY '12 sales outlook is predicated on the President's proposed budget, that's what it says in the press release, despite the fact that the budget control act looks like it's going to chop that by about $25 billion. And if we assume instead that the budget is going to come down $25 billion from the President's proposed level, what sort of sales outlook would you have for next year instead?
Bruce L. Tanner: This is Bruce. Let me try this one. I think the answer is that it depends a little bit by the business area. If you just sort of think of Aeronautics and space, especially, those 2 business areas have a lot of backlog that extends over multiple years. And so really if we're talking 2012, most of what's going to occur, saleswise, for those 2 business areas in 2012 is contracts that are under -- in our backlog as of today, electronics. And I would suggest to you that that's probably not going to change whether it's the President's budget or the $25 billion reduction. Electronic Systems is a bit of a mixture. Some of the programs within that business area have that long-duration backlog and some of them are shorter. But that is less subject to the volatility in the budget outlook in the near term, say, 2012 than maybe businesses like IS&GS. The area where we have the most vulnerability to what's going to happen in 2012 is IS&GS. And I will say I think we've got a fairly good handle on what happens to that marketplace even in a budget environment with that $25 billion reduction you're talking about. I think we see the government's IT marketplace dropping from about 5% to 10% year-over-year. And I think that's about where we're seeing that layout in just about any scenario we can put together ourselves. In the meantime, we will continue to look to international to help offset some of that increase, but I think, hopefully, what I'm conveying to you is that I think under either scenario I don't see a whole lot of volatility in our sales outlook for 2012.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Access 3:42.
George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC: Bruce, I wanted to pursue right now like you've mentioned you returned more to shareholders in your free cash flow. Next year, with the $800 million pension payment, the free cash flow is probably something less than this year, maybe it's $2.5 billion to $3 billion. And you've got $1.4 billion $1.3 billion in dividends and you've been buying back stock at $3 billion. So even if you just continue what you're doing you're going to be returning like $4.3 billion versus free cash flow of $2.7 billion or $2.8 billion, would you continue to do that and just work down the cash balances? Or would you wind up lowering the share buyback? Or what other scenario might you come up with?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, George I think there's a couple of things there. You probably saw that we -- well I know you saw, George, that we did a $2 billion debt offering in the third quarter. We used about $500 million of that to reduce some of our debt obligations with 2013 durations on them. We have, I think, somewhere around $4.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet as we sit here today. I think that is fungible [ph] into the extent that we could either use that to further fund the pension plan, use it for general purposes or continue along the cash deployment actions that we have done so far this -- for quite some time, quite frankly. So I think we have the power to continue to do that. I think as I'd said many times with many of you folks, we don't need $4.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And so we will likely draw that down to a lower number. Some of that, again, being available for pension so that they're available for acquisitions and obviously some of that being available for cash deployment to our shareholders. So I would like to think we would probably continue to use the same sort of firepower we have today going forward relative to those buybacks going forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: My questions are F-35 related. First, why did you choose to, in a sense, negotiate this process with LRIP 5 through the press? Do you think that it's realistic that LRIP 5 won't happen and that you'll have to bill the government for that termination? And then lastly, with the budget control act as the backdrop, if the government were to reduce the number of F-35s that it buys over the lifetime of this program, when would that happen? Do you think that this is a fiscal '12 -- excuse me fiscal '13 budget introduction time frame like wind? When are we going to get a little bit more clarity on the impacts of the budget control act on the F-35 program, specifically?
Bob Stevens: Relative to your question, I want to just say back to you your words as why did we elect at least to paraphrase why did we elect to negotiate this in the press. That is absolutely the last thing that we're doing. We have a responsibility that I take very seriously here about disclosing and discussing with you and others the financial performance of this company. And as we had accumulated the termination liability exposure that I described to you at $750 million on the Lot 5 work that we've undertaken, as we've exhausted the Long-lead funding that we have and as in our discussions with the government, the construct of not receiving incremental funding until we negotiated a concurrency clause, in my mind was a relevant change with a new contract provision that we have not seen before, I have not had the occasion to discuss that with you and other investors of capital in this business that we felt it was simply responsible to advice the investors in the business that these discussions are underway. I have no intention of negotiating Lot 5 in any other fashion other than in good faith with those in the government who are chartered to negotiate Lot 5 as well. We've had many exchanges of ideas, many concepts have been advanced. It is very clear to all of us and hopefully this will sound consistent to you, that our customers are facing a new reality as are we, that they're confronting a greater number of challenges and they will clearly have fewer resources available to meet those challenges. And that's why our company has undertaken, for now, a multiyear approach to affordability. Divesting businesses, cutting expenses, checking capital carefully and engaging in a series of reductions in force that for us are very difficult and very painful, but yet we all know are very necessary. So there's no desire to elaborate in greater detail with you or anyone else about the details other than to inform you as honestly and as straightforwardly as we can about the quality of the business. I'd also say that when you're looking for insight as to when the program architecture of the F-35 might change, if it were to change, relative to quantities or timing, that decision resides entirely within the government and not us. We know there are deliberations underway now consistent with the budget control act as you've highlighted that are causing our customers to look at all their expenses just like we are, all their programs. Roles in missions analyses and how will the nation need to posture for an uncertain security future knowing they're pursuing a course now reducing $0.5 trillion so it's difficult for us to have greater visibility, and therefore, we can't share that visibility with you. But as soon as we know as we learned about the conditions on Lot 5, we will disclose this to you as accurately as we can.
Bruce L. Tanner: And, Jason, I'll just -- sort of one other more thing for consideration, I think we looked at instead -- at the levels of exposure that we have from a termination liability perspective, we really thought that this was something that we should disclose in our 10-Q filing and the reason we included it in our press release and we're talking about it today was so that there was no surprises when people looked at our 10-Q later this week that we haven't discussed that with you and the rest of our investors prior to that becoming public.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo Securities.
Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about both Aeronautics and ES just if I look at the pie chart in your presentation about what the profits should look like for the full year, it would seem like you need to have a pretty substantial sequential decline of, call it, $30 million or $40 million apiece in operating profits from Q3 to Q4. And I know you highlighted the F-22 in this quarter, I don't know if that $30 million is the swing factor, but just what would cause the profits to be down sequentially in the fourth quarter in those segments?
Bruce L. Tanner: Sam I'll take that and also the -- you're right. If you just squeeze for the fourth quarter, if you will, both Aero and Electronic Systems probably looked a little lighter than we've run for the first 3 quarters of the year. I think as we look here today, I think the return on sales will probably, for Aeronautics, will probably be more similar to what we saw in the first quarter maybe a little bit around that range and lower than what we saw in the second or third quarter. And that's really because of the risk retirements that I talked about that occurred not just in the third quarter, I mentioned for the F-22, but also in the second quarter for other planes [ph]. As we sit here today, we have the potential to have additional risk retirements in the fourth quarter but we haven't closed on those potentials yet. And so that's sort of where we are with the Aeronautics business area. For Electronic Systems, we're seeing -- we're going to have actually a little lower volume, obviously, in the fourth quarter with a very strong fourth quarter in 2010 from a top line perspective. We think that the margins will likely follow the sales excuse me -- EBIT dollars will likely follow the sales at a slightly lower margin. This is one business area, to be honest with you, although, Sam, right, I do believe that we have some potential upside there. I think what I'd like to see is I think the last 2 years in Electronic System, we've run somewhere around a 12.2% margin. I think if you just squeeze for the fourth quarter we'd be a little light for that and I would say it, one of my objectives will be to see if we can't get closer to what we've run in the last 2 years.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Bob, I'm going to go back to that F-35 issue from a different angle than my colleague earlier. There were multibillion-dollar costs associated with concurrency on the F-18 wing drop, which didn't service until very late in that program's testing and the government pays out without issue. As we look forward and we see these attempts to have industry shoulder more of this, I'm wondering whether it's fair for us to understand that it introduces 2 new elements to the picture: one is greater technical risk on the heart of the industry and two, potentially reduced profits because even if I logically extend what you're telling us, doesn't any share line up on this cost-sharing element portend overall profitability on F-35 is going to have to be lower than what we might have been expecting before?
Bob Stevens: Well, I think we've thought through this to the extent we can't have been able to given that we've learned about this just a few weeks ago during the government's discussions with us. We think that there is a pretty big distinction between that which you know, that which has been observed in a test program that might require the change in the configuration of an airplane. We think that there is a method to absolutely assure that we incorporate changes wisely and well so that there is no open-ended position from a government's point of view of the inability to get the configuration changed. We think we can put a share line on that. We think that can have a ceiling price associated with it, we would incorporate those changes and have responsibility for that. I think the dilemma, not only for our company, I'm certainly believing for our industry partners but I think for industry more broadly, especially knowing that the work that we do is so specialized. It is in essence so inherently governmental. This is not really a commercial line of business that we have here. So many of the systems and technologies are tailored for that extreme level of performance and unbelievably demanding conditions that -- and it's one of the immense motivating factors in this industry is to take on those technological challenges to put our best intellect and experience forward to challenge the boundaries of what is known and to genuinely create and innovate things that simply haven't been done before. And that's not in today's complex systems, that's not just in, let's say, airframe dynamics but it integrates airframe with propulsion, with avionics in very sophisticated ways. All who have done this know the challenges of doing that and you can just look at the headlines and see the challenges reside not just in aeronautical systems for the military but in state-of-the-art air vehicles, whether they're commercial or not. We think that deserves a good deal of discussion so that we can arrive at an equitable position with the government that respects where we should properly support our execution and performance responsibilities. But again we are willing to do and believe we have demonstrated both in taking a fixed price contract on Lot 4 and in supporting the Lot 5 work beyond the funding that we have had to keep our industry team focused, especially our small businesses, because we recognize it's difficult for them to get financing. They have workforces that are highly valued to us. We would not want to see any disruption in that workforce's ability to remain focused with the kind of the economy that we see today so there's a lot at stake in keeping that focus. And we think that fair and equitable position would result, in the long run, without undue pressure on profits by introducing new elements as you've described. And I think when we looked at history, we've seen the same general phenomenon that you'd described, that discoveries can be certainly unexpected and unpredicted and they can occur both early and late in a test program. And I think we will be mindful of that and we will bring that to the attention of our customers as we negotiate Lot 5.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: First for Bruce. Can you tie out how the F-35 work this year is weighing on your cash flow? And I guess how much you're absorbing versus the supply chain?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Myles, good question. Relative to LRIP 5, I'll presume you're -- don't know if I caught that in your question...
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's exactly right.
Bruce L. Tanner: So far through the end of the third quarter we actually had no cash exposure. On this program at this point in time, we had termination liability exposure predominantly, but not exclusively with our supply chain. We think of this as buying or committing advanced procurement systems and the like but not having sort of the bills through the pipeline to be paid at this point in time. That starts becoming realized cash starting this month, the month of October. And as we look out the point towards the end of the year and say we were still in the situation through the end of the year, I think that number from our perspective, Lockheed Martin's perspective, could grow to as large as $150 million of cash for the year. I'll quickly say that I think there are operational opportunities within the corporation that even if we did have that $150 million exposure on the LRIP 5, that we could offset that and still maintain the $4.2 billion that we've guided you to. But that would be a potential exposure if it was not finalized before the end of the year.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a quick follow-up on the F-35 and then one bigger question. Just in terms of how this resolves itself, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're saying you will likely find some middle ground where the resolution does have some cost share on future unknowns just that it won't be all of them?
Bob Stevens: Well I don't know how to answer that in specific detail. I will certainly tell you our intention is to negotiate good faith with the government. We've exchanged views, we've had a lively discussion here. They're onboard to taking information, we're onboard to taking information. There are uncertainties that we embrace in the work that we do today. We have many contracts that have cost sharing formulas with the government that is not foreign to us. It's finding the right formula for what I think for both of them and us is a new avenue for cost-sharing under a contract as we've tried to look for a precedent so that we could be informed by that, which has occurred over time in history, we don't find a precedent for this kind of contract provision in any contract that we have and we haven't been provided any precedent from any contract that might be available for us to examine. So I think we're fundamentally plowing some new ground here. Of course we're facing a new reality, where we'll continue to be confronted with new circumstances, is part of our commitment is to be as agile and as forward leaning as we can be but also to act responsibly and serve multiple interests and everyone knows that we have a responsibility to do that. So we want to engage and start the negotiation for Lot 5 in the totality of the negotiation. We submitted the proposal in April and are looking forward to receiving the should cost analysis so that we can take that onboard. And then in this good faith process that we believe accurately describes to be the environment we're in today, we can get closure on Lot 5.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe tying the topic into a bigger picture question. I wonder, Bob, if you'd be willing to discuss where you see the range of potential outcomes for the segment margins of this company at longer term. If we look back prior to the -- before the last defense spending upturn you guys were in the 7s, it's clearly a substantially different company today, but this F-35 discussion is one of many examples of the Pentagon acting substantially different than they have the past 5 to 10 years. When you put it on a pot and you look out, where do you see the potential scenarios for the margins for the company just because the difference for us financially modeling between 11 going to 10.5 and 11 going to 8 makes all the difference in the world?
Bob Stevens: I know that's true and I surely appreciate your question. I'm not sure I can give you an answer as refined as your question is because if we're talking about -- and I know how relevant a half a percentage point or a basis point is on returns, I know you appreciate that we've just described for you an environment of, let me say, more than reasonable uncertainty and I know you know that when you just look out at domestic and global events. We -- under a continuing resolution, Bruce talked about the sensitivity our business has under the CR, we have the prospects of a successful super committee. It's not clear if this committee is successful, if that number would be $1.2 trillion or more and where the incidents of those either expenditure reductions or revenue enhancements would follow. We have the mix of business in both international communities as well as domestic. We're working hard on the international front. And we think that can offset both revenue volume as well as profitability, and we performed well with our margin generation on the international business and is likely going to depend on wins and losses and just fundamental blocking and tackling in our business. I will say this: I like our portfolio very much. I believe it is robust, and I believe it aligns well with the aspects of the global security environment that we see today and I think our customers believe that as well. I have great confidence in our professional workforce. I would submit to you that they, like all of us, have been seeing this uncertainty grow now for probably the better part of 2 years. And if I look at the first 3 quarters of execution in our company in 2011, I am enormously proud of them. It does not mean we don't have challenges. We have challenges because we stretch far in technology and in our commitment to you. But they have stayed focused and they have stayed disciplined when Lord knows there were enough distractions out there. So I don't think I'm going to be able to satisfy that interest. Our goal is to sustain our margin generation. We understand what returns mean to you, what returns on invested capital mean in assessing the quality of this company and how that creates an investment. So hopefully our actions over the years, including returning cash to the shareholders and making prudent acquisitions and the way we've run this business has at least suggested to you that we take this responsibility seriously.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Bob, regarding your past restructuring efforts on headcount, does that really rightsize the business for the initial $0.5 trillion of cuts but if the super committee cuts more, then we'd probably see another round of restructuring?
Bob Stevens: Well if -- we've taken those actions thus far. And I think the best way to answer that is I don't believe today we can guarantee that we won't have to engage in more adaptations in our business if sequestration were to occur. I personally know that we haven't fully incorporated the prospects of sequestration here because you can't really have a feel today of the location of where those reductions would come nor the timing of those reductions. But I think I can speak with pretty good confidence that neither we, nor our industry colleagues, nor the Department of Defense have internalized both strategic and operational plans that are built on the consequences of the sequestration process. I think that's why Secretary Panetta and Secretary Gates before him both described the prospects of sequestration in very negative terms. So we don't really have that embedded in. We'll continue to run this business with greater agility if we see upside opportunities for innovation or for investment, we will seize those opportunities. We certainly have the financial capacity to do that. If there are more reductions necessary, we'll certainly try to build the strength of the business so that we can minimize those consequences. But we won't hesitate to take the actions that will be necessary to keep the business rightsized for the environment that we see.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Bob, you've got a tough challenge. I mean, the behavior of the Pentagon, though, has been building for this for some time as respect to the F-35. I think on prior calls, I asked you about UCAS and there was clearly a delay by the customer just to kind of drag things out as opposed to improve efficiency. So I'm trying to understand here what is really different from what's been going on for the last 18 months other than maybe this specific issue over, what I would call, changing the rules of the game after they've been started?
Bob Stevens: Well, for me, and I think I speak for all of us on the call, what's changed was the more definitive language in the discussions that we had that, as Bruce mentioned, required us to put a disclosure in our 10-Q and because we intend to be transparent and open with you and others knowing we were going to be required to put that disclosure in the 10-Q, have this conversation with everybody today as I said earlier certainly we have no interest or desire to negotiate anything in the press. That's not where negotiations occur, but the disclosure was mandatory and part of our responsibilities. I think for us, it was a new circumstance, Howard, to have bid Lot 5 exactly the same way we had bid Lot 4 which is what we were asked to do only months ago. To have submitted that proposal in April, and 2, 3 weeks ago, be confronted with a new contract requirement that wasn't reflected in the price that we have offered. And as we discussed the overall negotiation climate for Lot 5, we're advised that the additional funding that we have been requesting since February was, in fact, conditioned on the successful negotiation of a concurrency clause. My preference would be to negotiate all the terms and conditions and all the aspects of Lot 5 at the same time, not selectively address incremental pieces. I can say that if we had, had the funding associated with the undefinitized contract action, we would not have had a compelling responsibility to disclose and we  would've gone about the negotiations in Lot 5 as we did in Lot 4. And you will recall, we had no such discussions with you about events on Lot 4, that was a negotiation that took over 12 months from the proposal's submission, to having a contract concluded in its finality, and we weren't having discussions. This is a responsibility for disclosure that we undertake, and the conditions that we see now are the first really tangible evidence of changing the requirements and expectations for Lot 5 and that's why we're talking about it now.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So you mentioned throughout your commentary on the quarter risk reductions and the amounts for various programs. And believe me, in your latest 10-Q for the first time, you revealed the amounts in total for the first and second quarters, I believe it was 4.25% for the second quarter. How big was the benefit from changes and estimates of completion in this quarter and last year? And approximately how large should we expect that to be for the year?
Bruce L. Tanner: Cai, I'll take that one. We've come back and looked historically, I'll say we're, generally speaking, around somewhere between 26 and 32-ish kind of a percent on a quarterly basis in terms of the amount of pickups or step-ups that we have on our contracts, think of those as the inception to date adjustments that reflect the risk retirement that I was talking about earlier on the F-22 program. Now I don't recall that out of the top of my head but I want to say it was somewhere in the $300 million to $400 million range this quarter, probably closer to the $400 million actually maybe a little bit higher than that maybe as much as $425 million or so in the third quarter. So I don't think out of school of what we did in the second quarter and if I remember your question right I would say, going forward, we would expect to have a fairly good-sized, maybe a little bit towards the lower end of that percentage as far as the adjustments going forward. Again this year and a little bit last year also, it's because of the F-22 wind down, there were just some recognition of a lot of risk retirement with the end of that production line that we took that obviously post 2012 won't be there.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn of Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Bob, to what extent could unit quantities for future LRIPs, let's say 6 and 7, or frankly even 5 be tied to these concurrency costs? And that we could be flatlined here at 29 aircraft as for the SAC-D proposals on the basis that maybe they're looking to just find a solution if you can't find one otherwise?
Bob Stevens: I think that I wouldn't rule that out as a possibility, Rob. I don't have the insight nor do we participate in the determination of exactly how overall risk on the program would be managed. And I know you're suggesting in your question, would the prospect of incremental cost for concurrency changes be offset by a reduction in production quantities, I'm not sure whether that would happen or whether that would not happen. Our goal has been very much to keep our head down and focused on execution and the details of the development and the test program and then on the production side continue to more tightly weave together our global supply chain so that we can improve maturity, improve quality, lower the total cost. Our experience is built on a foundation of just a couple of observations and one of them is that volume matters over time on production programs. We've got a good learning curve in the aggregate for the work that we're undertaking on the F-35. It is, again, just as some of this risk of uncertainty, in my judgment, is inherently governmental, it's also the government's responsibility to look at concurrency on the program and make their judgment of what those cost risks consequences might be from concurrency changes in the production bills compared to the opportunity of driving down learning curves aggressively. And in my mind, reaching out for international opportunities to help build the volume on the program. I would just remind all that the name of this aircraft is the Joint Strike Fighter for a reason. It's not only Joint with regard to the Air Force and the Navy and the Marine Corps here. By design from the inception of this program forward, it was intended to be multiservice and multinational. And with that construct came the prospect in any economic environment of greater quantity. So when we do our modeling here, we look favorably at a forward leaning posture that would reach out and build security cooperation partnerships between our governments and friendly and allied governments and in building those security cooperation partnerships, we would have an aircraft that by design was interoperable and having the ability to be shared consistent with our global supply chain. That is the F-35 by design. So it is possible that future production lot quantities would be affected by either concurrency cost risk or other cost risks or other appraisals of the program. That decision doesn't rest with us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Bob, could you give us some color around F-35 learning or cost reduction, what you're seeing there, how it's tracking relative to prior programs? And then one for Bruce. Bruce, can you give us some detail around -- you'd talked about the booking on -- your booking on F-35 this year is a mix of EMD and LRIP 2 through 4, can you talk about how that changes as we move into 2012?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes. Let me take on both those, actually. I'll say the learning curve performance that we've experienced so far and that we are actually forecasting in the LRIP 5 proposal is in family or a little better than in family with all the experiences of building similar fighter aircraft at least in our portfolio, our history of those type of aircraft, be it F-16s, be it F-22s, be it F-117s, even. I think the learning curves we're experiencing so far, as I'd say, are in family or a little better than that at this juncture of the -- the comparable juncture of the build sequence. So I think we're actually performing very well in that regard. And we're continuing to show those sorts of improvements going forward. Relative to the booking on F-35, we do have a situation where I think next year is EMD or the SDD contract sales are going to be a little bit lighter but not much than this year. So we still have, I'll say, the drag of a low-margin cost reimbursable type contract. We have actually had some of the risk retirement inception to date pickups that Cai was referencing on the LRIP contracts last year and this year so those opportunities are still there. And part of it is, Dave, back to your question on learning curves is, assuming we do make those learning curves going forward, that's one of those elements of risk retirement that will enable us to increase the inception to date booking rates on those programs [ph]. I wouldn't think, though, that you would see a large increase on the return on sales. Having said everything that I said between 2011 and 2012 simply because of where we are on those early production lots.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.
Peter J. Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Bruce, you just touched on this a little bit, but I was wondering if we can go further. I think you said the SDD contract on the F-35 would be down a little next year. I'm just wondering in your top line assumption for 2012, the LRIPs for F-35, sort of in aggregate, are they expected to be up, are they expected to be flat and to what extent maybe the LRIP 5 timing of that contract depends or drives that?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, very little LRIP 5 impact on 2012 costs that I would expect to see. I'm doing this from the top of my head a little bit here, but I believe the F-35 -- if I just think of F-35 in total, and that includes both the SDD contract and the LRIP contract, I want to say we're growing some 7-or-so percent year-over-year for 2011 and 2012. The development contract, actually, is reducing somewhat, not a lot. I want to say $100 million or maybe a little bit more than that year-over-year and the difference is more than offset by increases in the LRIP contracts from '11 to '12.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just one quick one for you, Bruce, in the interest of time since we're running behind. On the pension, I don't think you'd mentioned this, but the $800 million in funding for next year, how do you see that looking beyond if things are unchanged, what sort of contributions do you think we might end up seeing beyond 2012?
Bruce L. Tanner: Carter, I'm a little hesitant to speculate beyond 2012, given where we are today. But I have looked at that. And I'll say -- and I always caution this with current course and speed assuming the 4.5% discount rate held and asset returns would be at the expected longer-term asset return rate of 8% versus 8.5%. I would think our funding level on an ERISA basis or the cash out are paid into would be close to the amount we're talking about in 2012 going forward. So I wouldn't see an increase year-over-year beyond 2012 assuming those parameters hold constant with what we're seeing or projecting in 2012. So think of it as being $1.3 billion ERISA payments in 2011, about $2.1 billion next year. And I would think that number will stay fairly consistent short of those previous items or factors that play into the payments changing, as I said, the discount rate in the asset return.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis of Lazard Capital Markets.
Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I just want to switch gears real fast to talk about the Joint Air-to-ground Missile. It could face some cancellation risk here, if that does occur, do you think that that's actually a positive for the HELLFIRE for a potential new upgrade to the system?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Mike, I'll take that one. The JAGM, we're watching that very closely. Obviously, we've got a number of customer tests and a number of, actually, company-funded tests and that missile is performing very well. You might think of this as sort of an all-capability missile for any target on the ground from both rotary wing as well as fixed wing. The HELLFIRE is performing extremely well. In theater, it is battle proven, it is very affordable. I mean, it has every characteristic you'd want to have in a weapon of that nature and I would submit to you that we have improved the HELLFIRE over the years, not just going forward. We have made that a better missile bringing back a lot of the technology that's already being considered into the JAGM, into the HELLFIRE and we could do that going forward as well. So that's a product we would be pleased to sell for a long, long time.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a clarification, Bruce, when you said 4.5% for the discount rate, is that actually what you're seeing or are you giving us a sensitivity that can establish kind of worst case scenario conditions because Northrop, for example, is looking for more of a 25 to 50 basis point headwind. It's 100 basis point headwind, I'm just curious, is that what your actuaries are telling you?
Bruce L. Tanner: Yes, Myles, the actuaries are probably a lot easier for me to understand at the end of the year as they are now, frankly. But I think just from a sensitivity perspective, I think we're seeing realistically right now 75 to 100 basis points drop since the end of the year. So it's probably somewhere in that range and that's the reason we went with the 100 basis points, frankly.
Bob Stevens: Good. First, I want to say thanks for your help on the call today, Karen. Thanks, everybody, for being patient. I know we went longer on the call again, we thought we had a lot to talk about the F-35 and other programs. We took some time today to describe to you some of the challenges that we're facing. But we also have some very strong fundamental differentiating aspects of our company.  Our financial strength and our stability, our cash generation, which provides exceptional firepower for shareholder value deployment, our workforce excellence, which I believe is second to none and our program portfolio that offers the best alignment to global security needs. We'll continue to work hard, we'll continue to stay focused, and we look forward to talking to you on the call in January. Thanks again for your time today. Karen, thank you again.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you, Saeed, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Stevens: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining in the call today. In the second quarter, we continued the positive momentum we established at the beginning of the year. In the quarter, we achieved sales growth of 2%, grew earnings per share from continuing operations by 11% and generated $843 million in cash from operations. This performance enabled us to increase our full year guidance for segment operating profit earnings per share and operating cash. In the quarter, we also repurchased 13 million shares of stock and made dividend payments of $258 million. These actions continue to provide solid returns to shareholders while assuring we sustain appropriate investments in our business. Since we were last together in April, the range of global security and economic challenges we described as we assessed our strategic landscape has not diminished, and the environment remains fluid, particularly with regard to debt ceiling deliberations. Domestically, the highest priority focus remains on assuring that our nation does not default on our debt obligations, that we develop a balanced plan that reduces deficits and liquidates our national debt, and we establish a foundation for economic growth. We are under no illusions about the difficulty of meeting these demands and continue to provide all encouragement to the administration and Congress as they undertake this work. As there is yet no clear long-term course of action, we will not attempt to predict what elements will emerge in the final approved plan. What we can do and what we are doing with the resources we have is to redouble our focus on execution across the company as we drive for greater efficiency.  This quarter, we implemented staffing reductions in 2 business areas: Space Systems and Aeronautics. As a number of our programs transition from development to production, we'll look to flatten organizations, tighten the span of control and drive affordability. While these staffing reductions are very difficult aspect of running our business, they are essential in responding to the new realities and changing economic conditions we face. Our customers are being asked to do more with less on a daily basis, and the demands on them are enormous. It's imperative that our cost structures be as low and efficient as possible to provide affordable solutions to meet their needs. Looking at our largest customer, key leadership changes were effective this quarter with the retirement of Secretary Gates and the swearing-in of his successor, Secretary Panetta. The department continues a roles and missions evaluation to determine what programs and levels of resources are required for our national security and the President's fiscal year 2012 budget request of $671 billion. That's $553 billion in the base budget request and $118 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. It's currently under Congressional Committee review.  Looking at the international environment, world economic conditions vary. The eurozone is showing considerable stress with areas of high unemployment, low economic growth and large national debt levels impacting countries such as Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy. Other market regions are more positive, and demand for our products remains strong in a number of countries, particularly in the Middle East and Pacific Rim. Future sales growth in these regions is expected in fighter aircraft, Missile Defense and cargo aircraft as we continue to work to expand the content of international revenues. Despite domestic and international pressures, our portfolio of products is well positioned to provide assistance in support of critical national security requirements. Let me turn to key operational events that occurred this quarter and start with our largest program, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, where we achieved multiple noteworthy events and continued progress on both the development and production programs. On the development program, flight test activities continued ahead of plan for each aircraft variant. Through June year-to-date, 448 test flights were completed, which is 18% ahead of the 378 flights planned. Test point achievement remained 30% ahead of plan with 3,907 test points completed against the plan of 2,996. At midyear, we accomplished 51% of this year's planned flights and 58% of this year's planned test points.  Other development accomplishments included the successful delivery of 2 additional test aircraft to the Patuxent River Naval Air Station which completed deliveries of all carrier variant aircraft for the system design and development flight test program. One carrier variant was subsequently deployed to Lakehurst, New Jersey to conduct jet blast deflector ground testing, while a second carrier variant initiated Catapult hook up testing at the Pax River test site. Both of these events supported the expanded pace of Navy activities as we prepare for shipboard testing in 2013. The software development plan consists of 3 blocks of software with 2 releases in each block. The software that is flying today, release 1A, is performing well with respect to functionality and stability. The next release, 1B, is in the integration lab test phase and is looking to move to the flight test program. Release 2A is in initial system integration and release 2B has completed requirements definition and is in development.  Block 3, which provides enhanced war fighting capabilities is early in the requirements definition process. This software program has approximately 1 month of scheduled pressure, where we're focused on applying resources and mitigating impacts. Overall, we believe there are sufficient resources to accomplish this software program. The first full mission simulator was delivered to the schoolhouse at Eglin Air Force Base. This system will provide the next generation of F-35 pilots and maintainers with the most advanced training system in the world. Progress on production also continued. In the quarter, we delivered the first 2 production F-35 aircraft completing Lot 1 deliveries.  Beyond the quarter, momentum continues to build. The first 2 production airplanes from the second production lot were delivered to Eglin Air Force Base. These jets will be used for activities in concert with training pilots and maintainers at the new F-35 integrated training center. The next 4 conventional takeoff and landing jets are all in the final stages of acceptance flights and transfer. The next 6 jets are the Lot 2 STOVL aircraft, and we're working with our customers to mitigate any potential impact associated with the late delivery of STOVL propulsion systems. Of the 63 airplanes under contract, 46 are now in factory flow, 21 are in component assembly, 16 are in final assembly and 9 are on the flight line going through initial flight qualifications. And our fifth production lot proposal for 32 airplanes is being reviewed by the U.S. government.  On the international front, the Norwegian Pilot Unit unanimously supported funding for 4 F-35 training jets to begin fulfilling Norway's future air combat capability requirements. The Netherlands exercised its order for one test aircraft under the Lot 4 contract, and Australia and Italy are on track to participate in production Lot 6. Because so many have raised questions, I want to take a minute and talk about 2 areas of cost on the F-35, the cost of the first 3 production lots and the estimated $1 trillion cost of sustainment. The first 3 production lots are up to 31 aircraft in total, including 3 for international customers, making the total U.S. government buy 28 aircraft. Each lot has a cost-type contract with an incentive fee provision and progressive cost-sharing responsibilities to assure that the industry team is focused on cost containment and owns a share of any cost growth. This formula was mutually agreed to during the negotiations because it appropriately recognized the inherent risk in starting a production program with new aircraft, particularly when the development and test program was running in parallel.  Earlier this month, the Joint Program Office released an estimate indicating the cost of these 28 aircraft might be as much as $900 million more than target. It's our understanding that this estimate assumes more conservative worst-case conditions and includes both estimated costs in excess of targets associated with our execution performance and estimated costs with revising the production aircraft in these early lots to include changes resulting from discovery in the test program, a risk seen in all aircraft programs generally known as concurrency. About 50% of the estimated cost growth is associated with execution performance and 50% with concurrency. We are absolutely committed to working with our industry team and our customers to reduce this cost pressure as much as possible.  When we negotiated these lots, we did agree to stretch as far as we possibly could and accept the challenging cost targets. As we have executed the bill, we've been unable to meet all of the challenges that were undertaken, and we are sharing in any overrun. We take our responsibility for cost reduction and affordability seriously and believe we have identified about $200 million in cost-avoidance opportunities on these first 3 lots that our customer will evaluate.  We also recognize that the concurrency cost challenges will be completely extinguished with the conclusion of the test program and will not be a recurring element in the baseline cost of the aircraft. Even with the cost pressure that has been recognized, the cost of each production lot and each successive jet is declining. There can be no doubt that we're taking affordability challenges seriously not just in Aeronautics, but across the entire company. Over the last year or so, we've affected facilities consolidations, divestitures, a voluntary executive separation program, reducing senior ranks by 26%, expense and overhead reductions, salary freezes for senior executives, organizational changes to tighten our span of control and reductions in our work force. We'll continue this focus. The cost of the F-35 will continue to come down, and we will deliver a high-performance, effective and affordable solution. Relating to sustainment, in an effort to understand the long-term ownership cost of the F-35, a U.S. government model was developed that attempted to estimate the cost of 2,443 aircraft in 107 squadrons at more than 50 sites worldwide through the year 2065. This 50-year model includes many assumptions about phasing, flight hours, training sites, personnel, wage rates, support equipment, spares, aircraft configuration, modifications, fuel costs, risk factors, inflation rates and many other elements of cost. The result was an estimate of $1 trillion. While much more work needs to be done in examining the details of this estimate over such a long half-century horizon, there are 3 early observations.  First, there is the issue of comparability or context. To my knowledge, the F-35 is the first and only program to undertake such an extensive estimate, spanning broad ranges of programmatic considerations over more than 5 decades. It's my sense that if other capabilities were to be estimated with the same assumptions over the same time horizon, the results would be similar, if not greater.  For example, if the fleet of legacy fighters that the F-35 will replace were to be similarly estimated, the cost of their sustainment would likely exceed that of the F-35 without achieving any of the significant aircraft admission systems benefits afforded with this fifth generation capability. It's important to remember that part of the value of the F-35 lies in its ability to enhance and leverage the performance of other systems, adding significantly to strategic flexibility and tactical responsiveness. The second area is estimability. 50 years is a long time, and the estimate is in then year dollars. Assumptions about rates and factors that compound over decades have a profound effect on the resulting estimate. The third area is a very important one, acceptability. There is no one in our customer community and no one on the industry team who accepts this outcome, no one. I certainly will not. I have every confidence that we and our customers working together will substantially reduce the cost of sustainment to well below this estimate.  Finally, on the F-35, with the critical importance of this program to our customers and our corporation, I asked Orlando Carvalho, a talented and proven executive who formerly served as President of our Mission Systems & Sensors business, to assist the current F-35 executive team by bringing his extensive background to strengthen our focus on remaining activities on the system design and develop a program. Orlando's expertise in managing large complex production programs as they transition from development will be invaluable. Turning to the C-5M program, our team completed modernization and delivery of the second production Super Galaxy this quarter. This modernization program is demonstrating a new level of capability in strategic airlift, and the improvements in performance and efficiency validate the value of modernizing these proven and viable aircraft in an affordable way. To date, we've delivered 5 C-5M aircraft as we continue to work on our multiyear contracts to modernize 52 air lifters. The modernization activities being implemented on the C-5 program have been calculated by the Air Force to dramatically reduce operations and sustainment costs and yield a net savings of almost $9 billion when completed.  Moving to Electronic Systems. We had key new business awards and operational achievements this quarter. In the expanding area of Ballistic Missile Defense, we received a contract from the United States Army for hardware and services on the Patriot missile program. We continue to see strong interest in Patriot around the globe. In a test of our Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system, we tracked and engaged an intermediate-range ballistic missile using data from our remote radar site. This successful test off the Coast of Hawaii marked the first engagement of the system against an intermediate-range ballistic missile, as well as the first use of a launch on remote capability. This challenging test and success to further improve the defense capabilities of our nation against the growing proliferation of ballistic missile threats.  Finally, in Electronics. We received a follow-on contract from the United States Army to produce 29 additional persistent threat detection systems or PTDS to support coalition forces in Afghanistan. This contract follows our completion of 28 systems that were delivered to the Army in 2010. PTDS is an affordable, highly effective, combat-proven, Aero staff-based surveillance reconnaissance and communication system in support of force protection and anti-IED missions. The system currently provides around-the-clock coverage and actionable intelligence that helps to protect our troops from a range of threats. This latest follow-on award, when fully exercised, will bring the inception to date PTDS total program awards value to over $1 billion. Since this Aero staff can accommodate a variety of sensor packages, we're exploring broader market applications for a proven low-cost capability. Moving to Information Systems & Global Solutions. For the 17th consecutive year, Lockheed Martin was ranked #1 in the information technology provision to the federal government. This quarter, we established a teaming arrangement with Carnegie Melon University to pursue innovative solutions in the demanding world of cybersecurity. To facilitate collaboration, we opened a new cyberlab near the campus to enable joint research into concepts and technologies that will likely shape the future of cyber operations and generate solutions to the growing challenge for government agencies to protect their networks and infrastructure against adversaries. These efforts will be used to support the recently released cybersecurity initiatives outlined by the Pentagon to help protect critical information from loss to adversaries.  Closer to home, our own corporation continues to be a target for attempted cyber intrusion on a daily basis. This past quarter, we've been a target of a sophisticated and highly publicized cyber intrusion attempt. Our safeguards performed as designed, and no data was lost. But make no mistake, the cyber threat is real, pervasive and only growing in frequency and sophistication, requiring new and innovative solutions to stay ahead of threats.  In Space Systems, we were very gratified to see the successful launch and geosynchronous orbit insertion of the first space-based infrared system spacecraft followed by the commencement of first imagery transmission. SBIRS GEO-1 is the most technologically advanced military infrared satellite ever developed. It will vastly improve missile warning capabilities, while simultaneously improving missile defense, intelligence and battle space awareness for our nation and allies for years to come.  Taken as a portfolio, these operational accomplishments across our business highlight our corporate-wide focus on program execution that we regard as a critical component of our strategy. They reflect the quality and depth of our leadership and the commitment of our team to meet commitments while focusing on affordability and improving quality. Our portfolio of products remains exceptionally well positioned to provide solutions and products to satisfy the critical needs of domestic and international customers in the growing global security environment. With all the pressures and challenges we all see on a daily basis, I'm optimistic about our future. Even with significant economic challenges, the global security environment remains complex and volatile, and advanced solutions will be needed. We have exceptional talent, expertise and the dedication of our workforce in helping solve the difficult problems faced by our customers. Their efforts will continue to be the foundation in providing customer and shareholder value.  I was particularly pleased in their evaluation of industry that Aviation Week & Space Technology recognized Lockheed Martin as the top performing company in our category for an unprecedented 4th consecutive year. This award belongs to our 126,000 employees and is a true testament to their focus on continuous improvement every day.  I'll turn the call over to Bruce now to provide additional detail on the second quarter financial results and our outlook on 2011, and then we'll turn to your questions. Bruce?
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, I would encourage you to follow along with the web charts that we've included today.  Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our first quarter. We grew sales for the company by 2%, which was in line with our expectations. Our earnings per share from continuing operations grew by 11% compared to last year, driven by higher sales volume and segment margins and a net benefit of a tax matter that we discussed last quarter more than offsetting almost $100 million in severance charges from announced reductions in both our Aeronautics and Space businesses. The impact of the severance charges was an $0.18 reduction to our quarterly EPS. We generated almost $850 million in cash from operations, a higher level than we had expected when we discussed our outlook last quarter. And we repurchased 13 million shares for $1 billion, which we will discuss in greater detail in later charts. So overall, we had a strong second quarter and solid results for the first half of 2011. Turning to Chart 4. We'll look at our sales by the 4 business areas. As in the first quarter, 2 of the 4 business areas grew this quarter led by Aeronautics with 9% growth and Electronic Systems with 6% growth. Aeronautics growth was driven primarily by the F-35 and air mobility programs, including the C-130 and C-5 programs, while Electronic Systems growth was driven primarily by Missiles & Fire Control.  Both IS&GS and Space had lower sales in the quarter with IS&GS again reflecting the absence of the U.S. Census activity that finished last year. Space Systems was lower due to reduced activity on the Orion crew exploration vehicle and lower sales for the External Tank program, resulting from the end of shuttle operations.  Moving to Chart 5 and our earnings per share in the quarter. Our earnings from continuing operations grew 11% over last year's level. And if you adjust EPS in both periods to add back the negative effect of the FAS/CAS impact, our EPS grew by more than 20% as shown on the chart. As I said earlier, this EPS growth was driven by a higher sales volume, a 40 basis point improvement in segment operating margin and the net benefit of tax matters versus the severance charges.  If you'll now turn to Chart 6. We'll discuss our share repurchase activity in more detail. During the quarter, we repurchased 13 million shares, significantly higher than during the first quarter when the threat of a government shutdown lowered our repurchase activity. As a result of our repurchases, we reduced our outstanding share count by more than 3% in the second quarter.  Continuing with our share repurchases on Chart 7, you can see that the second quarter of this year was higher than last year and that our year-to-date repurchases of 16.5 million shares in 2011 is higher than at this same point last year. Chart 8 shows our year-to-date cash from operations. So far this year, we've generated over $2.5 billion in cash from operations and almost $2.3 billion in free cash flow. On the right side of the chart, we show the amount of free cash flow returned to our shareholders in the first half of the year. With a $1.3 billion of share repurchases, along with a $0.5 billion in dividends, we've returned about 80% of our free cash flow thus far.  If you'll turn to Chart 9. We'll discuss provisions to our sales outlook this quarter, and I should say that all the outlook changes we'll provide assume a resolution of the debt ceiling discussion without an impact to the DoD spend level in 2011. For the overall company, we tied the sales range while leaving the midpoint of the range unchanged. Within the business areas, we increased Electronic Systems, reflecting its strong performance thus far while we lowered the ranges for both Space Systems and IS&GS given some of the pressures we've seen this year. For Aeronautics, we simply tightened the range to reflect increased revenue visibility for the remainder of the year.  On Chart 10, we showed the revision to our segment operating profit outlook. Overall, we increased the low end of the range by $100 million and increased the upper end of the range by $50 million, resulting in a $75 million increase at the midpoint. You can see that we substantially increased both the low end and high end of Electronic Systems range and maintained a high end for both Space Systems and IS&GS, while increasing the low end for both businesses. And again, for Aeronautics, we narrowed the range while maintaining the high end of our guidance. Moving to Chart 11. We show our earnings per share from continuing operations guidance changes in the quarter. As a reminder, we increased our EPS guidance for the year during the first quarter call to reflect the expected resolution of prior year tax matters that actually occurred in the second quarter. This quarter, we see higher segment operating profit for the year, lower corporate expenses, a lower tax rate and share count offsetting the severance charge in the quarter. As a result, we increased our EPS outlook by $0.40 at the lower end of the range and $0.30 at the upper end, reflecting our increased confidence in the year. On Chart 12, you can see that we also increased our cash from operations for the year by $100 million to a new outlook of greater than or equal to $4.2 billion. This increase in cash reflects the higher operating profit mentioned previously. Finally and just to summarize on Chart 13, we've had a strong start for the first half of 2011 and expect that performance to continue for the rest of the year. We believe that the results we're seeing this year reflect the actions taken over the past year or so to remain competitive and efficient, and we continue to return value to our shareholders even during challenging times. And I think, due to the expanded prepared remarks today, we'll continue the call beyond the planned hour duration to try to accommodate any open callers in the queue.  And with that, Saeed, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc: Just a quick question about some of the language in your release itself with regard to the severance actions, particularly in Aeronautics. You suggested that part of it was to reduce -- due to reduced expectations around spending levels, particularly globally. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about what you see in some of the out years with regard to demand for Aeronautics and whether this is signaling some sort of change that you see on programs outside the F-35.
Bob Stevens: Jason, this is Bob Stevens. We envision that the strength of our portfolio in Aeronautics will have a good reception in the out years both domestically and internationally. You mentioned the F-35, and I think that we expect to see based upon our continued ability to execute good levels of demand domestically and internationally on the F-35. On the F-16 program, we've already, I think, commented with real transparency and clarity not only to you, but to our international customers that we're getting to the end of that F-16 line. We have worked to rephase the balance of our production deliveries on the F-16 that allows us to bridge program performance to the end of 2013. And we have, at the same time, advised that if we don't receive firm commitments for additional F-16s on or about the end of this year, then the line will certainly begin to shutdown, if not, have a significant gap. And I think that's caused a number of our global customers to evaluate their inventory needs. As we look at the F-16 specifically relative to future opportunities, both the Omanis and the Iraqis have expressed interest in purchasing additional F-16s. And we were advised as you were earlier this month that the United States government will likely make an up-down decision on whether or not our government will release new F-16s to Taiwan. So there are certainly elements of interest here being expressed in the prospect for future F-16s, and we'll keep you posted. We expect the C-130 program to do well domestically and internationally. It's a strong and proven performer, and I think the strength of that demonstrated performance matters a lot in an environment where uncertainty is increasing. And we were certain that we'll see growth on the C-5 program. So our initiative to engage in a reduction in force is part of a broader initiative to drive levels of affordability in this company. And it's not uniquely associated with our expectations in Aeronautics on international markets.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Bob, I wanted to, if I could, follow up on your F-16 comments for a second. There's been some chatter about an F-16 upgrade program for the U.S. due to F-35 delays, and I want to know if you could give some comment on that program? I'd be interested to know if you think an F-16 upgrade program for the U.S. would be real? If you think there'd actually be money for it, and if it might come at the expense, for example, the F-35 program.
Bob Stevens: It's just a little, I think, early to make a forceful determination about that. I know that there are always ongoing evaluations in the Pentagon about the need, desire and practicability of service life extension programs on airframes and, really, other platforms. And I do believe that's occurring in an evaluation of the F-16. But I don't think any final decisions have been undertaken. And I think as we examine the environment in which activities are unfolding in the Pentagon, there is currently an ongoing roles and missions evaluation. There is an ongoing strategic assessment. As you know, there are ongoing budget deliberations, and I think the confluence of those examinations will likely need to mature a little bit before we'll all get greater clarity on what an F-16 service flight extension program may be looking at. You added, I think, a thought about the F-35 program. We're certainly applying all our energies to assure that we deliver the best F-35 possible in the most affordable way. The F-35s that are flying are performing well. The feedback that we're getting is very good. That, which we're discovering and learning in the test program, it changes or additional action is needed. We're taking the appropriate action. So generally, I think there's a positive view of the F-35 relative to its performance in the test program, and we're focusing with all our energy, along with our partners and suppliers, to make sure the costs can be contained, and that we'll have an affordable program here. And I think overall, the F-35 will prove to be a very good performing airplane.
Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: On the F-35, could you talk a little bit about LRIP 4 and LRIP 5? And in particular, you had mentioned costs have been coming down per unit as you've gone through each of the blocks. My understanding is LRIP 5 is a little bit more expensive than LRIP 4, and then on top of that, we've had this seminar on services committee, most in their amendment to put that under a firm fixed price contract. Can you talk about how you're looking at LRIP 4 and LRIP 5 and also how progress is going on LRIP 4?
Bob Stevens: Sure. Well, the way we're looking at LRIP 4 is head down focused on execution, building the momentum off Lots 2 and 3 and driving the costs and assuring the quality and cycling the production line, which I honestly believe, Doug, is everything everybody wants us to do. So it's a very head down, day-to-day focus on getting the supply chain to cycle in an appropriate way that feeds the production line and then driving efficiencies through that production line and assuring quality of the products that are done. I think as you know in the early production lots, there is a development program running in parallel. There are discoveries that are occurring in that development program that get fed into the line. So part of the challenge in the early lots is doing that, incorporating those changes with efficiency, and we're working hard to do that well. Lot 5 has not yet been negotiated. We submitted our proposal, which is a fixed-price incentive-type contract proposal basis in April. The government is undertaking a new should-cost approach. We haven't had any feedback from the should-cost evaluation. We think that's likely to be forthcoming perhaps next month. And with that, we believe we'll be able to engage in a very good dialogue as we attempt to negotiate a Lot 5 position that is both affordable and realistic and reasonable. But we don't want to leave it there. We intend to work with our customers to drive the incremental costs of Lots 6 and 7 and beyond out of this airplane and have confidence that over the long run, if we do our jobs effectively and well and if the preconditions that are necessary in the architecture of the program exist, that are amenable to high-quality and affordable produceability of the jets, we'll have a very competitive, very high performing airplane here in the F-35. Relative to the Senate Armed Services Committee language and commentary on the program, I'm quite confident the Senate and I'll extend this to the whole entirety of the U.S. Congress, they want to see affordable systems. They want to see cost control. And in a program like the F-35, they want to see and need to see that over time with the increase in production volume that the costs will come down such that we will have an affordable and competitive airplane. I will tell you that everyone we talk with in the Department of Defense wants exactly the same thing, and I hope and trust you know that we and our industry partners want the same thing. That's how you have a successful program that meets the expectations that we not only have for ourselves, but that our customers have for us because we take very seriously the responsibility we have here to provide the kind of capabilities that the U.S. military needs and our friends and allies demand in a world where there's increasing instability in the global security environment. So we're very focused in this regard, and we will continue to drive with all our energy to get a high-performing, low-cost, very affordable F-35.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Campbell from Barclays Capital.
Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital: The IS&GS backlog of $8.6 billion, one of the lowest we've seen since this segment was created down, it looks like a little over $1 billion since year end. And less than 1x the forecast sales, which you took $100 million to $200 million out of. And I wondered if you could just share with us some of the dynamics of what's happening here. I wasn't sure whether this order intake was coming in a segment that was more sensitive to the CR. Maybe some of the divestitures affected the numbers in ways that made them look different than I was thinking. And last quarter, you noted that the intel was trending down. So I wondered whether this was continuing? And just in general, a little more color on this.
Bruce Tanner: Joe, this is Bruce. I'll take that one on. You threw a lot of things out there, so let me try to address maybe several of them sequentially here. I think IS&GS of all 4 of our business areas is probably the one that is most sensitive to the CRs because it is sort of a hand-to-mouth kind of business relative to some of our other business areas in terms of orders converting to sales. So I think there was some of that in the early first quarter associated with the CR, IS&GS typically always has a large fourth quarter in terms of orders being awarded in that particular quarter as the first quarter obviously, of the government fiscal year. We expect to see that same trend happen this year. So you'll see a bit of a spike, at least we're expecting to see a bit of a spike in the fourth quarter for our orders. You talked about security, and there's several phenomenon going on kind of concurrently within IS&GS, and part of it is within our Intelligence business there. We went through several years of some fairly large a big-ticket implementations of IT systems, if you will, and we're now seeing a number of much smaller sort of modern sustainment activities as opposed to large developmental activities there. And frankly, a lot of the developmental activities that the agencies need to get done have been done to this point. So I think that's some of what's happening on in Intelligence. Elsewhere in just the government IT business in general, we continue to see downward pressure associated with the fiscal environment that the government is facing. And that is manifesting itself in terms of downward spend on the IT budgets of the federal agencies that we deal with. We've seen that fairly much across the board in terms of agencies that we've dealt with for a long time that are simply reducing the amount of IT budget for activities that we've been supporting for a number of years. So I think that's sort of some of the pressures we've talked about within IS&GS. That's why again, we took the sales down in the guidance that we did. Overall for the corporation, I don't think the outlook or the results that happened in the second quarter surprised me. I tried to keep it up in the first quarter that we would see a sequential reduction between first and second. And again, I expect to see a sequential reduction between second and third. Third is almost always historically our lowest level for orders in the corporation. And I still expect that at the end of the year, we'll get back somewhere close to where we start the year 2011 somewhere in the $78 billion range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Bob and Bruce, you may want to forgive me a little bit for the historical context, but the last time you went through one of these things, Bob, I think was CFO, and you were very successful in implementing a lot of restructuring charges and changes. And I'm sort of trying to understand where you think the right size of Lockheed Martin will be as you look out as the changing environment. And then second, related to that from an accounting point of view, why are you taking some of the charges now? I thought you'd normally be able to capitalize some of those and recoup them over either some contracts or another period of time.
Bob Stevens: I'll take the first part, Howard and I'll have Bruce cover the second part on the accounting treatment. When you think about the long-term right size for Lockheed Martin, that's going to be dependent and a function of a number of ongoing deliberations, not just domestically but around the globe. Domestically, we're going to have to work our way through the increase of the debt ceiling discussions and deliberations. But I look at that as really the first and honestly initial part of a discussion that must include longer-term planning for deficit reduction and the long-term liquidation of $14.3 trillion in national debt, followed by a third companion initiative that looks to establish a better foundation for economic growth and expansion in the United States. This is a big set of demands. So it's not clear to me what the content of that planning will be at this point. So as to preclude some more definitive judgment about exactly what size we should have and structure and content would be best aligned. But I can tell you, we surely see the vector. We know where the general direction is going, and we're not going to hesitate to move out crisply and effectively in reducing our cost structure while improving our spans of control and our ability to navigate in an environment where the velocity of events is greater and the volatility of those events is broadening, we know we have to be more responsive and more agile, and we're working to do that. So all the actions that we have outlined to take really constitute a portfolio of initiatives that are going to put us in the right place at the right time. The future conclusions that are reached in the planning process will tell us whether we need to accelerate in some areas or whether we're about where we need to be in some areas. But I hope you have a feel for the general direction and the commitment that we have to be in the right place at the right time to assure the overall and long-term vitality of this company. And I'll ask Bruce to comment on the accounting.
Bruce Tanner: Yes, Howard. If you just think of the charges that we took, there's a $97 million split between Aeronautics and Space Systems Company, GAAP really requires us because of the size of the charge to establish a provision for the severance charges themselves. And our reported GAAP earnings per share on the government accounting side, and I think your question was actually more related to the government accounting or the PCA's side. We do expect to recover most of these charges in our contracts going for it. If you just think of the nature of the contracts in each of those 2 business areas, Space Systems companies mostly cost plus environment and again, we would expect to recover it in that environment. On the Aeronautics business, it has a greater proportion of its overall sales that are fixed priced and fixed price incentive, that even in the Aeronautics side, we still expect to recover the vast majority of those charges in the -- going forward with our customer. I mean, simplistically, I'll just try to make this as simple as possible. If you think of the cost of the severance, the lower cost that will result from these head count reductions sort of offsets the severance charges at about 6 months' time frame. So it doesn't take long for sort of that cost to get mitigated and such that it doesn't have an impact on the contracts going forward. Hopefully, that makes sense to you, Howard.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Access 342.
George Shapiro - Citi: Bruce, I had a question on the Aeronautics margin. You gave a lot of information this time around. I have 2 questions on it. One, it doesn't seem like you would have changed the margin on the F-35 R&D program or the production program. I just wanted to know whether that was an accurate statement? And then second, if you have any updates on the $600-million-plus of incentive fees as to whatever is going to happen to those?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Let me try to address those, George. You're correct on the F-35. We did nothing on either the development program or the production program in the quarter. So you're insight is six-spot on there. The one thing that I'll point out that maybe was embedded in your question is that in the second quarter, we had a pretty good adjustment positively on the C-130 program that really reflects that we delivered the last multiyear aircraft on our C-130 multiyear program in the second quarter. So if you think of all the risk retirements that we sort of plan out towards the end of the program, that is now sort of consummated itself at the end of the quarter. So we took quite a larger pickup in the second quarter simply because of that event. That likely will not be repeated going forward on the C-130 for the rest of this year. The roughly $600 million that you're talking about, it's actually less than that because there were some events in the late 2010 time frame that reduced that value some $35 million or so. So think of it as around the $575 million, $580 million number. The most near-term events that we're watching there, and that's really all we can talk about because we really haven't scheduled out anything beyond 2011 quite frankly. But there are 5 near-term events that sort of all happened in the fourth quarter of this year worth collectively a little over $50 million or kind of equally split. Think of that $50 million being equally split over those 5 items, and we're watching those closely. We think we are performing well on the vast majority of them. A couple of them are kind of close. We're working to sort of address those in an efficient manner as we could possibly do. So I don't think we'll have much more to report to you even in the third quarter call, George, but definitely, the fourth quarter call, we'll have a good idea. Actually, we should have a great idea because I should be completed by that point in time, and I can tell you then what actually happened.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Bob, I was hoping you could comment a bit on the F-22 with the grounding situation there. I would imagine there's not much in terms of materiality impact because of the percentage completion accounting. But if you could comment on how you're working with the customers all the situation and the feedback you're getting and kind of lessons on how you're feeding that into other aspects. And also, Bruce, could you comment on the outlook for 2012 on the F-16? Is it still looking to be 40 16s or you are kind of level loading given the uncertainty on the long-term outlook there?
Bob Stevens: Yes, Myles, I'll start on the onboard oxygen generating system issue. Sometimes it's referred to as OBOGS because everything here has an acronym. The environment here is that some pilots, but not all pilots have experienced hypoxia-like symptoms. And it's sort of important to go through a little detail of that because hypoxia in the cockpit environment has a very specific definition. And what's being experienced is hypoxia-like but has not been established at this time as a failure of that onboard oxygen generating system. So at this juncture, there really hasn't been an obvious or apparent cause of what are intermittent symptoms that some pilots are experiencing. So the Air Force quite rightly has stood the airplanes down and commenced an incredibly thorough and detailed review to see if we can get to the root cause together of what this cause might be. As of our conversation today, we collectively have been unable to replicate the conditions. But again, I think the Air Force quite prudently has taken an F-22 and added some very sophisticated instrumentation and is flying that instrumented airplane to see if those conditions exist, and if the conditions can be observed, then if we can trace backwards together so as to the root cause. So the U.S. government has believed the cause is really unclear at this time. I should tell you this phenomenon has occurred on other jets from time to time. So I have every confidence the Air Force has all the expertise to create the conditions where this phenomenon can be appropriately examined. It's not a financial issue to us at all, and we are doing all we know how to do to support our customer. So that they can get to the bottom of what this condition is and how we can fix this condition and how they can fly these jets with confidence. And I think they and we have confidence that we will get to the bottom of it. It's just one of those frustrating circumstances now where we haven't been able to determine root cause as of this time. But we'll continue to work with the Air Force on that initiative.
Bruce Tanner: Myles, this is Bruce. You asked about the F-16 quantities as we look out to 2012 time frame. We are still thinking in numbers of about 40 aircraft or so for 2012. One of the reasons for that, frankly, is because a good portion of those aircraft are actually Turkish aircraft that are being delivered off of an assembly line in Turkey as opposed to the assembly line at Fort Worth. So those aircraft are going to happen in accordance with the Turkish needs unfettered. The other thing that may be behind your question though is and Bob kind of said in his remarks, but I'll just echo a little bit there. We have adjusted some of our future deliveries in the 2013 time frame. I think in some earlier discussions that I've had with several of you, we were looking at sort of a mid-year or actually maybe even closer to the early part of the year end of the F-16 line, we have renegotiated with a couple of our international customers to extend that now to the end of the 2013 time frame. But specifically answering your question, next year's deliveries we still expect to be around the 40 number.
Operator: Our next question comes from Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Bob, I have 2 questions for you. One is as we look ahead into this budget debate, if this budget debate results and cuts to the carrier force levels, there is a potential that added savings of needing fewer air carrier air wings. So can you help us -- how should we think about the impact of fewer F-35 fees on the price of the F-35? Does this have a potential domino effect on the affordability for international customers? Or would a narrowing build be far off a way that it wouldn't affect the next few years?
Bob Stevens: Well, Heidi, the direct answer to that question is it all depends. And it will largely depend on what the total buy ultimately looks like. And in our view, how we accelerate through the production lots and how we might phase any changes in inventory, whether that's variant by variant, the F-35 C, which is the Navy variant or any of the other variants. It is simply, in our judgment, too early to determine what the budget deliberations will ultimately look like. I think we hold a pretty general model in our minds of knowing that the overall discretionary spending accounts, whether that's for defense or non-defense purposes, are going to come down as a part of a broad-based deficit and debt reduction program that includes actions on entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, the discretionary accounts and some discussions about revenue. And we're watching that unfold on a daily basis, and I won't comment on that. We also know that quite apart from the budget deliberations, there are strategic evaluations occurring about the quality and character of the global security environment. I think every observation that has been shared with us about that environment suggests that it is more complex. It is very demanding. It is highly volatile and uncertain. And as a result, we have to try to be as prepared as we possibly can be for lots of eventualities in the future. Some of the observations from those strategic assessments, and as I mentioned earlier, the yet-to-be-concluded roles and missions evaluation is that carriers are going to be an important element in the 21st century when you think about spheres of influence for our nation relative to assuring trade, access to routes, security issues in a shared and cooperative way. We have talked a lot about Afghanistan and Iraq, and they are important because we have forces deployed there. But we also think in terms of instability in the Korean Peninsula, lots of discussion about resource claims in the South China Sea, freedom of navigation there, Iran, the Middle East and other parts of the world that suggest to us that there will be a demand for a blue water navy, and there will be a demand for carriers. I cannot comment on exactly how many carriers, but I think the demands on the security side will be sustained. And it will be our collective jobs to determine at the intersection of the strategy and the budget availability what the right mix of force structure is. So, it's just very hard to handicap that. We know and believe and think history strongly supports that when you plan to build 200 Joint Strike Fighters a year and you facilitize to do that, if you build fewer than that, the cost of those jets will be more because we simply don't have degrees of freedom left in how we would amortize the cost that we have. We think that the tactical aircraft fleet needs to be recapitalized over the long term. We think that the proliferation of technologies around the globe strongly support the need for fifth generation capabilities that are already designed and embedded in the F-35 through a process that's now unfolded over 15 years of investment by this nation in this capability that the smartest and best things we can do with our industry team is put our head down and focus on execution and continue to drive this program forward in cooperation with our customers. And then we and they together will look at the changing strategic landscape and budget landscape and try to make the right decisions at the margin.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Terrific. And can I ask a second question?
Bob Stevens: Yes, you may.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: You referred to it actually in your answer. You remarked about global security strategy and I wonder if you would update us on your thinking and the top initiatives that you're embarking on to really flush out that strategy more broadly? And perhaps in your answer, Bob, to help us understand how you're defining global security. Do you mean via TACAIR cargo and Missile Defense? Or are you looking into growth and new initiatives and if so, can you give us color on those?
Bob Stevens: Yes, I'm going to try to be brief because we could talk for 2 hours, Heidi, without exaggeration, and I've been known to do that, but I promise I won't. The definition of global security is getting broader from our point of view. And you mentioned some immediate focus areas that tend to be in the military application of security interests, and we have really very high quality core program capabilities here in those areas. But we've had a lot of discussion recently about cybersecurity. We'll have growing discussion about energy security, and that is not a U.S. phenomenon. It's a global phenomenon. We will talk more about how governments can provide continuing effective services for citizens in a more efficient way because their stress on government is at every level of government, and that's not unique to the United States either. We think we can play a very strong role in information technology applications in a variety of domains, in the cybersecurity domain, in the energy security domain, as well as in the humanitarian relief aspects of our program portfolio, the Intelligence component and the military component. So my sense is that the demands around the globe are only growing. And when we do a region-by-region, country-by-country assessment, the volatility of events and the demands there are really considerably increasing. And those demands are actually exacerbated by the state of world economic conditions that, I think, generally if you took them in total are showing more signs of stress so that there'll be fewer economic resources available to meet the growing set of security demands. We want to play a role there. We think we've been effective at doing that historically. We intend to make the adaptations in our company that are necessary to assure that we can meet our customers at that intersection of fulfilling their security responsibilities in an affordable and effective way. And, Heidi, let me say this to be brief in my comments. We'll make sure as we move forward together we comment more clearly on our views of global security and the responses that we're taking to that changing global landscape.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I have a couple of what might be more mundane questions, but just on the Electronics segment where you raised revenue guidance, I was wondering what the driver was? Was it the PTDS follow on or was there something else there? And then I was wondering if you could just be more specific, or maybe I missed this, the corporate staffing reductions that you just announced, I think, last week, are those embedded in this guidance or not? And if not, what can we -- how can we think about it?
Bruce Tanner: Joe, I'll try to take both of those. On the Electronic Systems' revenue guidance. The bigger driver there as opposed to PTDS is more Missiles & Fire Control volume up, but also just the entirety of MS2. The PTDS order that Bob talked about, the additional 29 units will have some sales in 2011, but it's not what's driving the increase actually. Most of those sales because of the time it takes to develop those systems will actually occur in 2012. So the bigger driver again is primarily Missiles & Fire Control and MS2. On the corporate voluntary reduction as we sit here today, Joe, I don't think that the numbers we're expecting to see from the number of people who will take the voluntary lay off are going to amount to a large enough number that'll move the needle very much at all this year, at least that's our expectations as we sit here today.
Operator: And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: You've done a very nice job of holding and actually raising your operating profit forecast this year despite retaining the midpoint of the sales forecast. But notwithstanding, looks like the margins will decline at least a bit in the second half. Can you talk about the trends by segment as we go from H1 to H2? What was one time in the second quarter, which, of course, is quite strong and which of these 2 halves are better indication for margins next year?
Bruce Tanner: I'll try that one also. I'll just maybe just go around the horn for all 4 business areas and talk in margins there. I think if we start, maybe, with Electronic Systems to begin with, I think margins in Electronic Systems are probably going to follow a somewhat similar pattern to what we saw in 2010, which also experienced a higher first half of the year than the second half. Currently, I'm looking -- I still think we're going to be in the 12% range next year, and my guess would be going forward that, that's a good assumption for 2012 as well. IS&GS margins in the first half, actually, we think are probably a little lower than what we're going to see in the second half of the year. We think as we sit here today that the margins for IS&GS are probably going to end up being slightly above 9%. And same comment for IS&GS as I just made for Electronic Systems. I think IS&GS is kind of a 9%, low 9% business in 2012 as well. Aeronautics business area, we would expect the margins to be a little lower in the second half of the year. Again, I've tried to tee up with George's question the notion that we did have a fairly good-sized pickup on the C-130 program as a result of delivering the final multi-year aircraft in the second quarter. That won't be replicated in the second half, so I would expect those margins to be slightly lower. And I would expect the Aeronautics differing than the Electronic Systems or IS&GS to be lower in 2012 than it is in 2011 primarily as I've tried to tip numerous times because of the continued growth of the F-35 program offset by, in particular, lower sales on the F-22 program in 2012. And then finally, in Space. Space had a very high quarter, 13% quarter. That's not the run rate that we will see in Space. That was mostly due to the timing, phasing some of our equity earnings primarily in our United Launch Alliance having to do with the phasing of some of the launched vehicles themselves. That's not a change in our outlook for the year for Space, but it did happen earlier than we were expecting it to, and that's what caused the spike in the second quarter. Because of that spike, I would expect the second half to be lower than that. And as far as the run rate for Space, I think it might be slightly lower than this year, but still in the 11%, 11-plus percent level is what I would expect to see in 2012.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Bob, a question on cash deployment. You talked in the past about a balanced cash deployment strategy. But clearly, at the moment, you're spending a large amount on the buyback. Do you think there will be a benefit or not from, maybe, proportionately putting more into the dividend versus the buyback?
Bob Stevens: Well, we like the cash deployment philosophy that we've had, Rob. Let me say it that way. We've had a commitment now for many years of assuring that we return at least 50% of our free cash flow to investors. And I think history is probably not only instructive but informative about how we look at the world and what we are likely to do going forward. We wanted to have what we regarded as a good and competitive dividend position. I like what we have done there. And I think in September, we'll give the value of dividends full consideration, and we'll make a decision there. And we've been opportunistic with our share repurchases. And I'm quite confident we'll continue that kind of approach to a share repurchase program. The good news, I think, is that and I'm very proud of our leadership team and the professionalism demonstrated throughout the company in focusing on cash generation. They have been able to do that very effectively and very well through now a variety of quite different market conditions. They've been focused on cash generation. So we're able to produce that level of operating cash and then equivalently, the leadership team here has been very prudent in how we invest in the business assuring we're investing in the right things at adequate levels of investment but not a $0.01 more. And as a result of that, we've been able to, I think, engage in the kind of value-generation activities that you and others might well regard. And dividends and share repurchases play a very big role in that. They have historically, and I think they will as we look forward together.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Could you give us an update on pension in terms of your performance year-to-date kind of what you now see contributing this year and next year? What's happening with CAS Harmonization and kind of what the numbers might look like if we close the year with the interest with the Moody's and kind of some of those interest rates about where they are?
Bruce Tanner: I'll also take that one on also. Where to begin? I think on U.S. where we stand from a sort of performance today, I'd want to say we're tracking pretty closely to the overall equity return of the global equity market. So think of that as I want to say somewhere in the 4-ish, 4.5 percentage range, something like that. Not at the 8.5% that we have for the year, but we're not through with the year yet either. Discount rate-wise, if we were to pick it today, actually I think the data I just looked at that not too long ago, but I think today would actually indicate it's fairly close to where we close the end of the year in 2010. So I wouldn't expect to see much movement if we were to draw a line in the sand today as to what we would select for that discount rate. And then I'd say the other -- yes, just the outlook going forward. I think CAS expenditures I think we've described that as $1.3 billion this year. We have an expectation that the CAS number in terms of what needs to be contributed relative to CAS will increase next year. You asked about CAS Harmonization. I'm not sure where that's going to end up quite honestly at the end of this year. It is still our expectation and our numbers are kind of based on that becoming effective in 2012. I think rough order of magnitude if CAS Harmonization were not to occur in 2012, you should think of that as lowering our CAS cost estimates by about $150 million or so. So the FAS/CAS swing will get worse by that $150 million, if you will. And then maybe the final point, Cai, I'm not sure if this was in your question or not, but we sort of measure our CAS performance on sort of end of May to end of May time frame as we sit here today because that period of time, obviously, has closed out. We actually finish that period of time for CAS measurement and greater than 8.5% return versus our 8.5% assumption on the asset side. So that element's locked down. We're still looking at sort of some of the actuarial data for the population along with the CAS Harmonization we'll give you a better of indication of where we sit there likely in the third quarter.
Jerry Kircher: Saeed, this is Jerry. I know we're over -- as long as there's still some people in queue, I guess I'd ask you, how many are still in the queue? Because I would like to try and catch a few remaining ones.
Operator: I'm showing 9 more in queue.
Jerry Kircher: All right, we'll keep going. If people want to have the time, we've got the time here. So we'll go to the next question.
Operator: And our next question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I apologize for repeating, but I'm just very curious on this topic, which a caller just asked about the buyback versus the dividend. And if I look over the past couple of years, you've spent 2x to 4x on buyback versus dividend. And it's been several years since buyback has been an incredibly fruitful effort just given what the stock has done. And a lot of that is out of your control. And I guess, I wonder going forward, you guys have spent a lot of time talking about the macro environment, which in a lot of ways is completely out of your control. Why wouldn't you look at making a major change in almost flipping that ratio of dividend to buyback such that you're giving the cash straight to the investor to do as they wish with it versus reinvesting in something where as we've discussed here a lot of the drivers are completely out of your control?
Bob Stevens: Yes, I appreciate the call and the comment and the straightforward nature of the recommendation. We like a balanced approach that gives us flexibility as we look forward. I can tell you that we don't have an algorithm that says 2:1 or any such thing. Your comments will certainly be taken under advisement. We really value assembling the points of view that get offered to us with opportunities like this on the call and in other discussions that we have. With respect to the share repurchase, we intend to be opportunistic. We do absolutely see dividends as an important and vital mechanism through which to directly convey value to shareholders. I don't know if I was sufficiently clear in my response to the prior question, but coming up here in the third quarter in September, we will make our determination about movement on the dividend. And we will certainly take your views and the views of others in full consideration when we make that determination. But the point that you're making is clear to us, and I appreciate you making it.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Strauss from UBS.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: This might be more of a question for Bruce. The F-35, the cost overruns on LRIP 1 through 3 that, Bob, you spoke about and the potential for you all to accommodate some of those, how does that work mechanically in terms of your booking rate? Is that something you already accounted for in terms of how you're booking the program today? Does this just relate to incentive fee no longer being there? If you could just walk through the mechanics. And then as a follow-up, Bruce, I don't think you specifically have stated what your guidance now has baked in for share repurchase and tax rate for the year.
Bruce Tanner: On the first one, I think the short answer is on the F-35 LRIP 1 through 3 growth numbers that were reported, this is not new news. These numbers have been tossed around for quite some time. They were currently considered in numerous CAPE analyses, had to be considered in a number of sort of certification, the technology baseline reviews. So our booking rates have considered that for some time, and we would not expect to see a change because of -- it is depressed, but that's not a change to our expectations from where they've been for a while. The second question was relative to our planned share repurchase activity for the second half of the year. Essentially, David, what we have assumed is that we're going to maintain the current share count, which essentially says we will offset any sort of share accrete from option exercises or shares put in our retirement plans and the like. So now that's what the guidance is based on. We'll obviously, as Bob said, be opportunistic in the second half as we always are that says typically what we assume we started the year with $1 billion share repurchase embedded in the numbers. We felt confident we were going to get there. The current number assumes nothing beyond the 1.3, I guess it's the simple way to say it. And then as far as the effective tax rate for the year with all the improvements we've seen to date, the effective tax rate should be in the -- I'm guessing about the 27% range for the year in total.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Gleacher & Company.
Peter Arment - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Yes, Bob, I guess could you give us your thoughts on a need for maybe more portfolio shaping given, I think, the expectation that we're going to see kind of a nose down direction in future budgets or maybe conversely using some of your robust free cash flow to adding into some of these target adjacencies that you've kind of laid out, given your global security framework? I mean, is there an opportunity there to -- an economic critical mass basis versus just kind of some of the relationships you just started such as the Carnegie Mellon one?
Bob Stevens: Yes, Peter, certainly. We absolutely invest ourselves fully on this strategic assessment. The portfolio we have today we've shaped with care. And so we have what we want and we are today where we want to be, and we are making appropriate but limited investments internally to strengthen that portfolio to make sure that it's rigorous and can meet these changing demands that we see from customers and assuring that we can be agile and responsive in those areas. On the acquisition front, which is one of the facets of cash deployment that we didn't talk about when we talked about dividends and the share repurchase contribution to value generation. On the acquisition front, we followed a string-of-pearls approach that has been effective for us and we like, and that is the mechanism, Peter, that we have used to as you, I think, very appropriately described it. In an accelerated way, build some critical mass in areas that are important to us. Some of the features in that environment, I think, will be obvious to you. There are some things we like that just aren't valued very well, and we are not going to be unmindful of the responsibility that we have to you to make acquisitions at a value level that allows us to return the value to you and not put all the value in the acquisition. And that is a tighter and narrower market. And I think sometimes we see, in our judgment, companies that we think should be at a certain value level a little overheated because of the commentary or the interest in the market, and we want to be judicious in how we do that. So we are examining actually quite a number of areas of interest in that regard. But we are not going to lower the screen for selectivity. And I think historically, there's probably been pressure on the members of our industry when we are at an inflection point and see pressures on the budgets for our core markets to maybe get a little more adventurous there. And we are mindful of the need to have real discipline and real rigor in our evaluations of these future prospects and to be selective, and we think that will pay off in the long run. So we're careful in assessing the portfolio that we have in house today. Those reviews are really ongoing. And I say ongoing without exaggeration because the pace of events around the globe has accelerated to the point where you really can't do like a strategic plan a year or the durability doesn't last a year. Conditions really do change, and we don't want to fall behind the value prospects associated with varying conditions. And we'll continue to survey the marketplace to see if there are acquisitions that would make sense but we'd be prudent in the way we go about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Hugel from Stephens.
Eric Hugel - Stephens Inc.: Bob, from a big picture standpoint, can you discuss sort of, I guess, the current level of company funded R&D investment and how do you believe this trends over the next couple of years amid sort of all the heightened budget uncertainty, but again, balanced against the growth needs of the business?
Bob Stevens: Yes, Eric. We are looking on the company-funded side of about $800 million a year or so. I think we're going to sustain that level of R&D. When I mentioned the word uncertainty in the environment and everybody's desire to see uncertainty reduced, I think we can parse out that uncertainty in a variety of domains. One of the levels of uncertainty is what will the industrial base be called upon to provide in a changing global security landscape? Probably 5 years ago, we weren't talking a lot about cybersecurity. I can assure you, we're talking a lot about it today. We don't think that there are going to be a significant number of let me describe it as large program new starts. So here again, we want to take real care in not simply labeling on resources to do exploratory research and development where there wouldn't be a highly valued application that the nation and our customers will need. So we're spending a fair amount of time trying to work with customers around the globe in gaining a good understanding of the challenges that they see through their eyes and where we can bridge our core competencies and capabilities today and where it would be smart to augment those capabilities through the application of research and development to get a broader portfolio of very highly-valued systems or products or services that they would find really good utility from. And, of course, the other challenge is we have to do that in an environment where we're also driving for efficiency, and we think that efficiency argument probably costs both ways. We have to get our cost structure down here. But if we can make investments through the research and development pipeline that afford greater levels of efficiency for our customers, then we're really helping them meet their mission demands in an effective way. One thought here is on the Joint Strike Fighter, and I know we almost always talk about the Joint Strike Fighter in terms of immediate program execution performance and so forth, and all of that is appropriate. But there are bigger opportunities on the Joint Strike Fighter beyond those discussions that include the application of research and development funds to improve the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability of the airplane to essentially build upon the extraordinary computer capability, intelligence capability, sensor capability, communications capability that's already designed into this airplane in an embedded and seamless way. In this respect, the Joint Strike Fighter really is very, very different than any other airplane that anybody has built, including the airplanes that we have built. And that is by design and working with our customers. So we also think in terms of how do we take our existing product portfolio like the Joint Strike Fighter and extend it into areas where you can get real leverage for our customers if you can do multiple missions effectively and well at quality levels and at least comparable to other systems that exist today or better. And you can do that while flying other missions simultaneously, we've really leveraged the use of this incredibly high-performing asset. So some of our R&D is going into those avenues as well.
Jerry Kircher: Saeed, this is Jerry. I think we're coming up on the half hour here, and we've run in some other half hour beyond the original. Can we do one last question, please?
Operator: Our last question comes from Troy Lahr from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: As budget is tightening up, are you noticing any material changes to the competitive landscape, both on services and hardware? Is anybody getting irrational or trying to come into your markets?
Bob Stevens: Well, Troy, I'll say it's from our point of view, this has always felt like a pretty competitive marketplace. And there may be at the margin companies who may not have the financial capacity that we have. They not have the durability or the capital structure that we have. They may not have the quality of the core portfolio that we have that may make some moves in that area. We're trying to make sure that we don't sit back and allow any thinking to seep into our judgment like incumbency is a particularly safe place and a comfortable place to be. I think that part of the world is changing, and that's why we're assuring that we focus on every program, every opportunity, every customer, every day because in this climate, very much embedded in your question, you can't become complacent. You have to take a look at that. So I don't think we've seen any dramatic expressions of that kind of behavior yet. We're looking forward as you are, and we're absolutely trying to make sure that we don't participate in that. We want to deliver real value in a real sense, and I think we will be able to do that. Saeed, first, let me thank you for your help on the call today. You've been patient. I know we've gone longer. From our point of view, there certainly is uncertainty in the environment that we face, but we're very focused in our company on growth, on execution and on returns to our customers and certainly to you. And we're very much looking forward to updating you at the end of the third quarter. Thanks for your patience with us today, and we'll sign off here, Saeed. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program for today. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you, Sean, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.

Bob Stevens: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll proceed on the basis that you've had an opportunity to read today's earnings release for first quarter results, which I felt provided a good start for 2011, including booking over $12 billion in orders that expanded our backlog to over $80 billion while achieving sales growth of 3%. Our focus, operational tempo, quality and overall execution remain strong. We were again able to generate exceptional cash flow with cash from operations of $1.7 billion. This robust focus on cash generation continues to be a key element of our strategy to provide sustained return to shareholders while still ensuring appropriate investments in our business. Since we last spoke with you in January, the dynamic change in world events continues to demonstrate the growing spectrum of complex global security requirements faced by our country and our customers. In addition to ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, instability on the Korean Peninsula, an emerging China and a threatening Iran, just this past quarter, we've seen unprecedented civil demonstrations for democratic reform across Northern Africa and the Middle East, tragic earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan and New Zealand, requiring an instant humanitarian response, and actions to protect civilians in Libya from the risk of widespread massacre by government forces. These events and others underscore the ongoing and at times unanticipated critical missions that our military must fulfill.  With this velocity of change and the volume and volatility of global events continuing to expand, more demands on our military are likely. For our company, these events are having the effect of changing some of the near-term priorities of our international customers, delaying, for example, orders for F-16s in Iraq and C-130Js in the United Arab Emirates, while the need for an integrated air and missile defense system in the UAE has been reemphasized and elevated.  On April 15, agreement was reached on the FY '11 appropriations bill ending the continuing resolution that had been in place since the start of the fiscal year that began last October. The final bill signed into law by the President includes $531 billion for DoD-based budget authority and $158 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The resolution of the FY '11 Appropriations Bill was particularly important because it provides the resources and visibility our customers need to maintain their operational focus. With funding issues resolved, we're also able to reaffirm our previously stated financial guidance for calendar year 2011. Congress is now turning attention to the fiscal '12 defense budget where the President has requested $553 billion for the base budget and $118 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. However, as we've already seen, there'll be much more discussion about the right levels of security investment. Let me turn to some operational highlights and start with a view of the development, production and sustainment of the Joint Strike Fighter, which is showing good progress. On the development program, momentum continues to build in flight test. In the first quarter, overall, we completed 199 flights against the plan of 142, achieving the highest quarterly level to date. The maturity of the STOVL aircraft is showing marked improvement, completing 101 flights versus a plan of 62, including 61 vertical landings. The conventional and carrier variants are also performing well, and overall, test point productivity is ahead of plan and software development continues to meet the revised baseline. On the production program, progress also continues. The first 2 production aircraft flew for the first time in preparation for a delivery to the United States Air Force that we anticipate will occur over the next couple of weeks. Low-rate initial production continues to accelerate with 62 aircraft in backlog, and we look forward to placing Lot 5 under contract later this year.  Working with our customers and our suppliers, we are turning our attention to lowering the cost of producing the jets and the cost of their sustainment over time. In the quarter, Aeronautics also received a $725 million contract extension to provide performance-based logistics for the F-22 Raptor. This contract extension builds upon our initial contract award in 2008 and is focused on a fleet-wide sustainment program for all 7 operational bases in close partnership with the Air Force. The goal here is the highest possible aircraft availability and performance at the lowest possible cost. Turning to Electronic Systems. 2 key new business awards this quarter merit special attention. In ballistic missile defense, we received a contract for $790 million to produce additional Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD weapon systems for the Missile Defense Agency. This order will double the number of THAAD systems in the U.S. inventory from 2 to 4 batteries. Recall that THAAD was activated in 2008 and is the only missile defense system with the operational flexibility to intercept both inside and outside the atmosphere, providing a versatile capability.  THAAD is a key element in our nation's ballistic missile defense system and has generated significant interest by international customers as they seek a proven missile defense capability to counter the growing proliferation of offensive missiles. Here again, we see an excellent illustration of how international work can stabilize programs and where additional volume can directly contribute to cost reduction and affordability goals. In our Littoral Combat Ship program, we received a contract from the United States Navy for $376 million for construction of the second of 10 ships awarded to the Lockheed Martin team in December of 2010. The Navy's 10-ship award procurement plan provides stability of the program allowing industry to more efficiently meet customer needs for an affordable, multi-mission surface ship. Beyond the 2 ships in our new contract award, our second LCS ship at Fort Worth remains on schedule and on budget for delivery to the Navy in 2012. Moving to the Information Systems & Global Solutions. We achieved a key operational milestone this quarter on the next-generation identification system for the FBI. The FBI announced achievement of initial operational capability on the NGI systems' ability to process fingerprint identification more effectively and more accurately, which will help in solving investigations faster, preventing future crimes and apprehending more criminals and terrorists. We're really proud of the ongoing partnership we've had with the FBI since 1999 in this key area of law enforcement. In Space Systems, we received a contract from the United States Navy for $340 million for the fifth satellite in the mobile user objective system or MUOS constellation. When operational, MUOS will replace the current ultra high-frequency follow-on system and provide 10x more capability in assured communications, including simultaneous voice, video and data for forces on the move.  Operationally, a key milestone was achieved with the shipment of the first Orion spacecraft structure from the New Orleans facility to our Denver test facilities. This delivery milestone supports the objective of Orion's first crewed mission by 2016. Across our business, we're focused on program execution and cost reduction while maintaining quality. This is a challenging environment. But we have a strong and well-positioned portfolio of products that address the critical need of domestic and international customers in a complex global security environment. And we have talent throughout our workforce and a culture that challenges one another to do better and set the bar higher.  I'm very grateful to be able to work in a community of people who recognize our ability to contribute and want to do more. Let me turn the call over to Bruce now to provide some additional detail on our first quarter financial results and our outlook for 2011, and then we'll open the call for discussion. Bruce?
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please refer to the web charts we've included today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our first quarter. We grew sales for the quarter by 3%, which is noteworthy given that the continuing resolution lasted beyond the end of the quarter.  Our EPS from continuing operations grew by 12% compared to last year, driven by higher sales volume, higher segment margins and lower share count. We generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations, a record level for the company, surpassing the previous record from the first quarter of 2010. We also grew backlog to more than $80 billion with a significant portion of the growth driven by additional efforts to complete the F-35 development program. So we're off to a strong start in 2011. Turning to Chart 4. We'll look at sales by the 4 business areas. 2 of the 4 business areas grew in the quarter, led by Aeronautics with 8% growth and Electronic Systems with 6% growth. Aero's growth was driven by the F-35 and C-130 programs, while Electronic Systems grew in all 3 lines of business. Both IS&GS and Space had lower sales in the quarter, with IS&GS reflecting the absence of the U.S. census activity that finished last year. Space Systems was lower due to reduced activity on the Orion crew exploration vehicle and lower sales for the External Tank program resulting from the upcoming end of shuttle operations. Moving to Chart 5 and our earnings per share in the quarter. Our earnings from continuing operations grew 12% over last year's level. Adjusting for the FAS/CAS impact to both quarters and the Medicare Part D charge that occurred in last year's first quarter, our EPS grew by 9% with the Medicare Part D impact essentially offsetting the increase in FAS/CAS expense between the 2 time periods. As I said earlier, the resulting increase was driven by higher sales volume, improved segment margins and lower share count compared to last year. Looking at cash from operations on Chart 6. Cash generation was very strong at $1.7 billion, again, the highest cash the company has ever generated in a quarter. With our capital expenditures staying consistent with last year's level, free cash flow of $1.6 billion was also a record. As you would expect, cash generation in the quarter will be lower as we progress throughout the rest of the year. I would expect the second quarter to be our lowest for the year as we had over $1 billion in planned disbursements including 2 tax payments, a pension contribution and the payments owed under the voluntary executive separation program. On Chart 7, you will see our recent backlog levels compared with the results this quarter. Again, we grew backlog to the $80 billion level driven mostly by the additional developmental efforts for the F-35 resulting from the recommendations of the technical baseline review. Looking forward, I would expect backlog level at the end of the year to be very close to where we ended the year in 2010.  Chart 8 shows 15 of our largest programs, which represent around 45% of our sales in 2011 and how we view the future opportunities for growth in these programs over the next 2 to 3 years. As you can see, with the exception of the F-22 program, we believe that these large programs are either stable or growing in the near future. Going forward, with the future budget pressures we are likely to face, the strength of the portfolio is going to be the key determinant as to which companies can experience growth in that environment versus which cannot. Clearly, the days of enough budget growth to enable every farm in the industry to grow are over. We believe our portfolio is strong and well-positioned to succeed in that environment. Moving to Chart 9, we will show our guidance changes in the quarter. We increased both our EPS guidance and cash from operations as a result of the favorable resolution of several prior year tax matters. As a result, EPS was increased $0.25 to a new range of $6.95 to $7.25 per share, and cash from operations was increased by $100 million to a new level of $4.1 billion. I should point out that the resolution of these tax matters actually occurred in the month of April and when you see the impact of these items in our second quarter results, it will be reflected as an unusual event. Finally, on Chart 10, we summarized the quarter. Again, we're off to a good start in 2011 led by a very strong cash generation, which gives us great flexibility going forward. I think we're well positioned to achieve our goals set for the year, though I would point out that the phasing of some of our objectives, such as cash, will clearly not be linear for the rest of the year. And finally, with the threat of a government shutdown behind us, we can focus on meeting or potentially improving upon our financial outlook for the year.  With that, I think we're ready for your questions. Sean?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I just wanted to ask, if you look at your share buybacks just relative to prior years, the $3.5 million that you did this quarter just appears to be a bit lower than you what you've done before. So I just wanted to know is this reflecting some conservatism in your part. If you could also -- if you could comment on what expectation should be for buybacks for the rest of the year.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Rich. This is Bruce, I'll answer that one. To begin with, we did $281 million of repurchases in the quarter. So we're actually ahead of the pace to achieve the $1 billion in repurchases that we had in our guidance. Having said that, it probably was somewhat lighter than it might have been otherwise, and probably there were a couple of reasons that drove that. First, as we near the end of the quarter, the first quarter, it became clear that the government shutdown was a real possibility. And frankly, we believe that a less-disruptive path both for our employees and our customers was for us to sort of just press on business as usual. We believe that a shutdown, if it actually occurred, would be short-lived, but we wanted to have enough cash to fund the activities in the event that, that a shutdown did actually occur. And right in the middle of this, we knew we had some large disbursements that need to be made in the second quarter such as the ones I mentioned, the best payouts, the taxes, 2 tax payments and a pension contribution, and those needed to get paid whether we were getting paid during government shutdown or not. So we wanted to have the flexibility to deal with those as well. So overall, we've not changed our approach just to how we plan to return of cash to shareholders either for repurchases or, for that matter, for dividend increases as we look later this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi Investments.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc: Just a follow-up to that question. You've got $3.9 billion in cash. You've spoken about having $2 billion in excess cash. You're getting set to generate roughly $3.5 billion in free cash this year. At what point are we going to see an acceleration of money coming back to shareholders either through share repurchases or through an increase in the dividend? I think clearly, you've got plenty of dry powder here, so to speak, and I think, as the prior questioner alluded to, I think expectations were that things were going to be a little bit more robust than what we've seen in the first quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about are those numbers right at this point and what you see going forward and getting that excess cash back to shareholders?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, Jason, I'll try that one as well. As I said to Rich's question previously, I think the first quarter was probably a little lighter than it might otherwise been had we not seen the potentiality at least of the government shutdown occurring. I still feel very strongly that we are going to follow suit for what we've done in the past relative to both share repurchases and dividend increases. We always take a look at the dividend increase in our September board meeting. That is our expectation, is that we'll do that again and during that time frame, so you won't see anything happen sooner than that. And repurchases, without getting into specifically what we're going to do on a monthly or quarterly basis, Jason, I think the history of what we've done in the past speaks for what we're going to do throughout the rest of this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Hugel with Stephens.
Eric Hugel - Stephens Inc.: Just a quick question with regards to sort of what's going on in Japan especially, considering most of your products are so heavily into electronics. Are you having any issues sort of with availability or pricing of electronic components?
Bob Stevens: Eric, this is Bob Stevens. No, we are not. We're seeing no disruption in our supply chain. Of course, as embedded in your question, we're paying very considerable attention to the durability of that supply chain over time. But we're not seeing any disruption here.
Eric Hugel - Stephens Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Bob Stevens: Certainly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: On the F-35, the program leaderships recently stated that you received only $7 million of $35 million of available award fee last year and also commented that there's about $370 million available this year. Could you talk about what your expectations are now in terms of what you think you can receive, how the program is performing with respect to capturing that award fee.
Bob Stevens: Well, I think the [Vice] Admiral [David] Venlet's comment about earning $7 million of $35 million last year is accurate. We achieved 1 milestone against which there was the $7 million earn out. This year, we have $52.5 million of award fee earning potential that are spread across 5 milestones that we and our customers believe to be critical in demonstrating forward progress on the program and enabling future activities to flow smoothly in this environment. The first milestone is completion of all structural tests, completion of the carrier version, suitability testing at Lakehurst, New Jersey. This is for carrier suitability. Releasing the Block 2 flight test software updated to the flight test program, having the STOVL version, the F-35 B model, engage in C trials and getting that aircraft out to the ship and finally, releasing the Block 1.0 training update to the Eglin Air Force Base training facility. Each of these milestones is achievable. Each of them has $10.5 million of award fee potential associated with it, and it's ours to work toward and earn. And I think we'll be able to discreetly measure progress against that. The remainder of the award fee pool, we believe, through future negotiations will be allocated in a similar way to milestones that are perceived as being critical to demonstrate the performance of the airplane and bring the production airplanes forward into their initial operational capability. We'll keep you advised as information becomes available on how well we're performing against these milestones.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: Bruce, you talked about backlog settling at around the $78 billion at the end of this year that you had at the end of last year, roughly flat. How should we think about this by segment? And Bob, do you see any further portfolio shaping?
Bruce Tanner: I'll start off. Maybe just to give a little color on the phasing of the backlog in total first for the year. I think we're going to probably come down just a little bit in the second quarter from where we are right now. And if you look at historically, we tend to drop -- third quarter tends to be our lowest quarter for orders out of all the quarters of the year, and then we kind of bounce back typically in the fourth quarter. I would expect that we will see a very similar picture as far as the phasing of backlog for the year. As far as by the segments and their concern, I would expect to see that Aeronautics will actually have growth and backlog for the full year, as will Electronic Systems. Space will likely see some reduction in backlog somewhat dependent upon the win or not in the GMDS, the ground-based missile defense system competition that's coming up later this year. And IS&GS is likely going to be a little flattish relative to backlog as from where they ended in 2010. And I'll turn it over to Bob for his side.
Bob Stevens: Thanks, Bruce. I like our portfolio. Of course, we've worked over time to fashion it, to have the content that it has today. We think given the strength of the portfolio, we have the ability to focus on good execution, and if we focus on good execution, we should see future growth. So I don't want to signal to you any unhappiness with the portfolio we have. But as a matter of business discipline and process, we have a continuing assessment of the quality of this portfolio, its relevance in the strategic environment for our domestic and international customers in the markets that we serve today and in the adjacent horizon markets that we might want to become more active in tomorrow. So there is an ongoing process here to evaluate this portfolio and to shape it appropriately. But I don't want to convey to you any dissatisfaction with the quality of the portfolio or our judgment with the substance that we have and the maturity that we have. And given the relevance and priorities of the programs and capabilities to meet demanding customer missions, if we execute effectively, we ought to be able to grow the business and maintain the health of the portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Yes, Bob, actually somewhat harking off what you just said, when we dissect the parts of IS&GS, it kind of buried in it, Intel looks like it's trending down, even actually EIG. So there's 1 area where defense budget growth should remain significantly above the total. It's probably in Intel, which sort of raises the question, what areas are you losing ground on or are you satisfied with internal performance and your wins there, or is there a customer problem, or is it a budget timing issue?
Bob Stevens: Well, I think there's a little bit of maybe all of the above. It's got a lot more to do with the specific program of GeoScout maturity and the delivery of mission components under the GeoScout program, which is trending the Intel down. I mean, you're correct in your assessment that Intel is trending down. But let me say again, that the quality of the Intel work that we're doing and the significance of that work to a broader intelligence community customer is a great value to us and great value to them. So while we're seeing a little downward trending here, that shouldn't really convey a dissatisfaction on our part with the overall Intel community. And Heidi, I think 1 of the things we all look at in the future is how exactly will the great need to address the cybersecurity environment mature over time and how can we, with our extensive experience in the cyber domain, not just with the Intelligence communities but really across the entire breadth of the federal government, how can we bring that experience in a greatly focused way to make real contributions to greater security in the cyber domain. That's a question that I think is getting answered with the passage of time. There's not a discrete answer today, but we are focused on that. And in 2 ways, I mean there's the infrastructure component. What modifications will be necessary in the cyber domain to assure safety and security there, and then in mission areas, the applications part where we have considerable strength across the company. So I think that will also be a part of the overall intelligence community story that we will write and tell over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: My question is on the 8-K you filed a few days ago on compensation. And there were 2 metrics that were mentioned. One was operating cash flow. It's going to be very important this year then there's ROIC. My questions are, why were these 2 selected in particular? And then obviously, operating cash flow is very easy for us to track, but I'm wondering if you could provide -- since you no longer provide ROIC in your earnings statement I'm wondering how that's tracking for the year.
Bob Stevens: Yes, the reason it was done, Joe, is that our management development compensation committee specifically and the board generally do very much want to listen to our investors, to understand their specific points of view about tying our compensation to performance, and the board is very serious about this, and I hope you all have a sense that they are. And in listening to the discussion associated with performance, they thought it was advisable for me personally to tie my eligibility for options to, in essence, a double trigger, not just options with best over time, but having to meet very specific performance-based objectives. And I'm entirely okay with that because this is a pay-for-performance environment for me and every member of the leadership team here. The 2 parameters, operating cash and returns on investment, were selected because we and the board believe that they are the most critical drivers of shareholder value, and I will tell you if you like $1.7 billion in operating cash in the quarter, if you like the allocation of cash and the way that we allocate it to drive superior returns, I think that you and others would want to hear a management team talking in terms of shareholder value in addition to delivering value to customers. And I think that closes the equation pretty well. So that is why it is done. We do give you a significant information on our cash generation and that we can certainly provide information about returns on invested capital.
Bruce Tanner: Joe, I'll piggyback from what Bob just said. The metrics that we use that we have been using in the past for our long-term incentive program have always been cash and return on invested capital. The ROIC portion of that has always been an annual metric. That's what the metric will be for what was filed on the 8-K as well, and so we're not going to show the quarterly performance, if you will, because it's not necessarily aligned with the annual numbers that we've put in place for the compensation. We will definitely show that as we get towards the end of the year in terms of the expectation and the actual ROIC performance for the year such that you can compare that back to the 8-K.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Bob, you made some comments about the push out of F-16s and C-130Js and maybe the mentioned potential acceleration of air defense. Could you give us a little bit more color on what's happening there, what stuff is moving on and why, what stuff might be moving forward and why and timeframes in which we might get some of these orders?
Bob Stevens: Yes, certainly, and I don't think you're going to see a wholesale movement in the orders. But quite specifically, Cai, we've, in conversations, been advised by the leadership in the United Arab Emirates that they want to postpone their order placement of 12 C-130Js and take that discussion up at a future time. Within that very same discussion or in that environment around those discussions reemphasized and elevated the need for an air and missile defense system because of the observation of the proliferation of offensive missile systems in a region of the world that, as we all see today, is highly volatile and risky. With the case that I mentioned in Iraq, around which there was an LOA for 18 F-16 aircraft, the Iraqis this year reallocated those funds for domestic purposes rather than security purposes. Our sense here is that we will reinvigorate those discussions about the 18 F-16s during the balance of this year and probably have more to talk about in 2012 about that likely order placement. These are rough approximations. So I would think the air and missile defense is going to hold the schedule and that the C-130s will be phased out through the Emirates. The good news about C-130s I think generally is there are pretty high-demand aircraft that are giving really exceptional service in their mission capabilities, and then we'll come back and talk to the Iraqis about F-16s later on this year presumably for an order next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Bob, I was wondering if you could comment on what you thought the impact of the CR was this quarter and how you think the rest of your year will now progress as the government sort of gets back to work.
Bob Stevens: Rob, well, I think, and hopefully we convey this to you clearly, as we were concluding the government fiscal '10 and watching the activities for government fiscal '11, we anticipated the likelihood of a continuing resolution. Of course, the difficulty for us and you and everybody is estimating the duration of the continuing resolution. We and others make assumptions about what the climate is like and what the likely debate will be and what the timing around a conclusion of the CR would be. We did not think for example a CR would be in effect for the full year. But we did think the CR would be in effect for a while. We incorporated those assumptions about timing and content and the ability to proceed into our planning, into our guidance, into our discussions with you. As Bruce mentioned earlier in his remarks, what we also elected to do believing that sometimes CRs don't end on a date certain but have some additional extensions. We felt it would be unacceptable and ill-advised to have a disruption in the focus of our professional teams as we are executing against our program commitments for the want of extensions to the CR that we believe wouldn't be long-term extensions. So I think what you were seeing are our ability to reaffirm our guidance is that our assumptions were pretty close to the mark as to the overall timing and content, had that continuing resolution not resolve the way it had on April 15, we'd be having a different conversation with you today. And I'm quite sure our customers would be subjected to an enormously more difficult operating environment because under these CRs, the customers are compelled to replan and replan and replan and replan almost on a cash to cash basis for the content of their operations, which is enormously demanding and time-consuming for them. So we were really gratified that the CR was resolved foremost for our customers' interest and then also the resolution of that CR was more or less right on our timing expectation for the resolution of that CR. We've been asked, what's the likelihood of a CR in 2012 and we don't know, and we'll probably have that conversation as we talk more about our year unfolding with you.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Access 342.
George Shapiro - Citi: Probably for you, Bruce. If I look at the Aeronautics margin this quarter, it was $10.4 billion and the guidance is basically about $10.7 billion and you disclosed a lot of details to what went up and what went down. But my question is was there any change in the booking rates this quarter? And how should that margin progress for the rest of the year, and then also if you might give an update on what revenues you're looking for, for the F-35 given the change in schedule.
Bruce Tanner: Well, thanks, George. I hope you were pleased. It sounds like you were with -- we did change our press release somewhat to have a little more detail into the programmatics by the segment. I hope that was useful and to all the callers today. Relative to Aero and the margins in the first quarter, I tried to tee up in the January call that the delivery of C-130 and, in particular, F-16s, were more back-end loaded in the year. They were not linear by any stretch. And so for instance, C-130s, 2/3 of deliveries on C-130 are on the second half of the year and more than 50% of F-16s are in the second half of the year. And so to a large extent, what you're seeing in the first quarter is sort of the absence of what's going to happen for the rest of the year relative to the higher margin C-130 and the higher margin F-16 business. There was not a significant difference between profit adjustments first quarter last year versus first quarter this year. The 1 exception to that might be last year, if you recall, we did have in the early Low-Rate Initial Production contract from the F-35, we actually had some step-ups a year ago. And those were not replicated in the current quarter. Other than that, again, I think we're fairly consistent from an overall booking perspective quarter-to-quarter. As far as U.S. F-35 growth for the year, I still think we're looking at just about $1 billion of total growth from the 2010 level of F-35 sales to what we're expecting to see in 2011. And you should think of that as being less than, what, probably 45% or so of the sales of the Aeronautics Corporation, Aeronautics business area in total. So growing fairly consistently as we predicted even with the little slower ramp rate on the production in large part because the development contract has, in fact, extended out to the right as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Bob, I'd like you, if you could, talk about how the benefits of VESP started to show up in terms of what you're seeing in operational flexibility and improved profitability. And then if you also might address the congressional language in the appropriations bill about eliminating some of these undefinitized contacts and how that might also help you.
Bob Stevens: Yes, thank you, Howard. So we've described to you a series of actions that we began last year with considerable earnest, really oriented around the discussion about affordability and affordability initiatives. We've heard Secretary [Robert] Gates, [Under] Secretary [Ashton] Carter and others in the Department of Defense talk about them, provide some outlines, some general orientation, some specific objectives. We felt it was incumbent on us as partners in these mission areas to develop our own set of affordability initiatives. They involve facilities consolidations, reducing expenses, travel airshows, we just highlighted because it's kind of a higher visibility thing, the voluntary executive separation program and scrubbing all expenditures and all budgets here. The reason is the seriousness of purpose that we know and share about the new reality that we're in where these global security demands are going to stay substantially high and the resources that are available to meet the demands are going to come down, and we need to do our part. I would tell you our sense back then and our sense now is let's get an early start, let's make significant moves on our part on the recognition that will take some time to see the effect of these changes in both the cost of our products to our customers and our ability to generate returns for our shareholders. I'll tell you I think we're starting to see the effect, and it would be, I think, an observation, Howard, that you would find familiar after taking these actions, but there should be more to come. In the interim, we are looking at what additional actions we can take because I think this is going to be an environment where continuous improvement and continuous reduction is necessary. I'll just offer 1 cautionary tone. We've been in this business a long time. I personally have done it a long time. I've gone through a lot of cost reduction initiatives. It's very important not to cut programs in a way that reduce their quality or their ability to perform over time. And I'll tell you some of this can be a little insidious, so we're trying to bring all our experience forward. Because if you cut spares, if you cut CAS or applications in some area, you won't see the adverse effect of those reductions in cost now. But you will see diminished mission capability, diminished operational availability, more cost falling into operations and maintenance because we have a longer sparing cycle and so forth. So I think we are in a good position to communicate our experiences here with our customers, and I think that dialogue is going to be ongoing. So expect more of the same with regard to a focus on cost take out for us. Relative to undefinitized contract actions, I think you know that we would prefer to be in a position of developing a proposal, submitting it and negotiating it fully and completely before we begin the execution on the mission capability that's defined in the contracts. But there are extension fees to date that I think appropriately drive our customers to want to move out with greater velocity and try to do some things in parallel, and that's how you end up with a portfolio of undefinitized contract actions. I think that we can professionally respond in either environment. We're certainly supportive of reducing the number of undefinitized contract actions as the line, which suggests. I think our customers would like to do that, but I also know our customers are faced with some of these enormously demanding challenges where they've got to take actions, change direction, perhaps buy some new things, perhaps change the acquisition of things they're pursuing. And that's what the UCA [ph] is for and I think if they use it judiciously and in a disciplined way, we can certainly contribute in that regard.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: Just a first clarification on the slide that has your portfolio of programs with growth, stable and down. What's the base here that you're thinking about for that growth? And the other kind of clarification is, can you give us some color if, over the last 12 months, the kind of pace of the programs that are in the growth category, which ones have accelerated and which ones have decelerated?
Bruce Tanner: Miles, I'll try a shot at this. I hope you found this chart useful. I think it's 1 of the things that, as we look at our portfolio and maybe the portfolios of others, 1 of the things that we have is a lot of high-dollar programs that a lot of the other peers in the industry do not have. And what we were trying to do with this chart is to give the opportunity to say these are some of the bigger-ticket programs in the portfolio, and this is our view of how these programs are going to perform over the next 2 or 3 years, with the base year to your question being 2011. And our action is even go out and take a look at the budget data yourself and convince yourself as you see fit as to whether or not these programs are appropriately aligned in the categories that we've put them in. But again, these are big drivers of the overall sales in the corporation. I think if I was to go kind of around the horn, if I understood your question on the green category, and say which ones are growing faster or lower or slower than others, F-35 obviously is going to continue to ramp up as we've said for at least the foreseeable future until we hit sort of the peak production rate. C-130J has got at least another year before likely probably peak at the production rate of 36 aircraft a year, and then it'll likely be fairly constant for at least a few years after that at that level. F-16 we've talked about in the past is going to spike in 2012 with likely about 40 aircraft deliveries for the year, and then we've got some work to do in 2013 to keep that number back up there or else it will, in fact, drop off at that level. Aegis is likely going to see some growth as we see, in particular the Aegis Ashore, but also the retrofit of some of the DDG 51s and the destroyers in the U.S. Navy. Patriot and THAAD are lumped together and say those we expect to have growth over the next 2, 3 years as well. LCS, again, once we get ramped up at the 2 shipped per year level, which I would guess we won't get in that sort of that steady state until the 2012 time frame, would be my expectation. And then we'll stay fairly constant there as we build out the other,, expectedly at least, 10 ships in the options. And then Advanced EHF [Advanced Extremely High Frequency] is likely going to see a little bit of growth. We've got another couple of I think vehicles 4 through 6 coming up and awards in the not-too-distant future that'll keep and those will be higher-dollar awards than the previous satellite. So I think there's going to be some growth there. And then GPS III obviously is really just not quite in its infancy stage but very early in its development program. I think we just completed the critical design review, and we're still a ways away from production. So that one's got its future growth out in front of it. I hope that helps, Miles.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: A follow-up to that, Bruce. Could you talk about the 9 programs that you have listed here as growth? Can you talk about what percentage of the portfolio they represent in terms of revenues today? And given what you see on this chart, what does it mean overall for the margin profile of the company? And then a quick follow-up on ES [Electronic Systems]. Could you comment? It looks like growth came in better than you would have thought in the first quarter yet you kept your guidance for ES sales growth unchanged for the year, which implies down from here. If you could just comment on that. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, David, for the questions. There's only a little over the top of my head. The top programs in the green category on that chart are probably -- I'm trying to do math in my head here. I going to guess they are less than the 40% levels of overall sales in the corporation. That's 9 -- there's probably little less than 40% would be my guess, and the rest that make up the other 5% or so of the sales of the corporation. I think relative to -- you asked a question on the Electronic Systems, its performance in the first quarter, and I'll say we were -- I'll speak for myself. I was pleasantly surprised by the quarter results. We kind of expected or I kind of expected that we might see actually some headwind in the first quarter primarily because of the lack of the PTDS order, the persistent threat detection system that we had some very rapid sales that occurred in 2010. We were actually able to offset most of that through a combination of things PAC-3 deliveries in the quarter. Some higher -- a number of programs within MS2. In fact, all 3 lines of business within Electronic Systems grew in the quarter. And within GT&L, the soft CLS contract grew almost $100 million compared to last year. So that more than offset the lack of the PTDS contract. As I look for the rest of the year for Electronic Systems, I actually think we are going to see sequential growth quarter-over-quarter. And I'll say, first quarter was probably a little bit early to call but I think we could have some upside there on sales, particularly if we receive another PTDS order, which we're in conversations with the customer about as we speak. And I also think, quite frankly, that EBIT is looking strong for the year relative to guidance. I think margins should be at the 12% ROS level per quarter going forward. And if there is some upside there, I think it's potentially driven by Missiles & Fire Control for the rest of this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Just the first question is, I noticed the benefit you got from cash taxes in the quarter. You mentioned some payments in the second quarter. Can you just tell us what your cash tax expectation is for the year? And then just separately, before I get cut off, can you just talk about the prospects of the government shutdown? You talked about raising cash in the quarter, I presume. That's why we saw payables jump. But can you just talk about how the customers are behaving how? Are you starting to see contract awards since the bill was signed into law? And really how is the customer behaving now and what should we see going forward?
Bruce Tanner: Cash taxes we actually did get a refund in the first quarter. I think it was some $250 million worth or so. And so our cash taxes for the total year are somewhat diminished because of that refund, but you should think of them somewhere in the north of $800 million, $850 million or so worth of cash taxes for the year. And as far as customer behavior and what we're seeing for awards post-CR or post-government shutdown threat, again, I tried to tee up in the January call that we really felt, just looking at the profile of our orders for the rest of the year back then, that unless the CR was to extend, I think we said, beyond the end of April kind of time frame, that we really didn't expect to see an impact to the guidance we're providing. And I'll say that's exactly kind of happened in April 15 right in line with our expectations, and so I haven't seen, we haven't seen a change in the first quarter and, thus far, I don't believe expect to see change for the rest of the year. I'll ask Bob to see if he's got a different perspective than I do.
Bob Stevens: Yes, Sam, I think that while it might have not been highly visible from the outside in, what happens under the CR is our customers have to go through extraordinary measures of phasing and shifting and rebalancing almost on a daily basis, and I'm not exaggerating. So I think 1 of the great benefits of not having a CR imposed but having an appropriations bill is they're back to more ordinary focus on priorities and, in fact, doing the kind of contract actions that may reduce the number of undefinitized contract actions that allow them to plan to give them the confidence that they have funds in place to go ahead and put programs under contract. So I would tell you we move from a period of extraordinary demands on the customers under the CR to more ordinary workflow in our customer communities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital: First off, Bruce, thanks for the extra level of disclosure in the release. That was very helpful. I want to piggyback briefly on Cai's question on Iraqi F-16s. It's been pretty clear that the Iraqi government has been tight on funds and I think you hinted at that. But oil production has been on the rise which helped this problem and so as you look at this order, is it dependent solely on funding or is there also an element of political stability and does an extended U.S. presence beyond the 2011 sort of play a role here? Or is it simply a funding matter that's just shifted out to the right?
Bob Stevens: Well, I think the dialogue that has occurred, I'll tell you very much in the open, is about roles and missions and the recognition that the Iraqis will need to stand up, an indigenous force structure and part of that force structure is going to have to include tactical aircraft, and the selection of the F-16 was already made. In my last visit to Fort Worth, that was, oh, about 2 weeks ago now, I met with a delegation from Iraq to listen to their planning and their description of the circumstances that are driving the interest in the F-16. What was conveyed to me and what I can convey to you now is unfettered support for both the need to have tactical aircraft, the very strong desire to want to stand up, an Iraqi government that is in full flourish, with all the appointments and things that a government needs to maintain their security, as well as all the domestic programs. There was some discussion about some short-term rebalancing to meet some exigencies and, as I mentioned, we're seeing that in a number of places and, frankly, we're seeing that a little bit here at home. The shifting of some priorities and the reallocation of resources. So that didn't surprise us too much. But what was conveyed was a long-term, a recognition of the need for probably more than 18 tactical fighters and the need for that kind of capability in the Air Force and a desire to be strong security cooperation partners with the United States for a long period of time. So I think these discussions have their word, and we'll measure progress against the milestones that were discussed and have a better feel for this as our fiscal year closes. And as we get into 2012, I think we'll have greater visibility here.
Operator: Our final question comes from Peter Arment with Gleacher & Company.
Peter Arment - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Bob, I guess I'll take this as an opportunity to ask move over a big picture question for you. I mean, you've seen the fiscal '12 budget in detail now and expectations are we're going to have the out-years. Or most likely, you're going to see some pressures similar to what happened here in fiscal '11. How are you thinking about getting more balance in the portfolio outside of defense? And I guess I'm thinking about your ramping up of your targeted adjacencies maybe to offset some of those pressures. And I realize you still have a very proactive process on the portfolio shaping and returning 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. But what's the desire to get more aggressive on the strategy?
Bob Stevens: Yes, I think that we are aggressive on our strategy. And by aggressive, I mean very highly, energetically looking at this portfolio and making our assessments of what the outside world is likely to look at. And I know we talked a huge amount about deficit reduction today. But there is also the need to maintain a security posture in a world that is showing much more volatility, and the U.S. military is such a reliable partner. I personally think the activities that unfolded in Egypt could have and would have been a lot more difficult had there not been long and well-established military-to-military ties where the militaries stood so tall and in such a distinguished way to maintain order in a civilian population. And I attribute a lot of that to having great close personal and professional relations with the U.S. military here. We think our portfolio is very, very well-positioned to the relevancy and the prioritization that customers will have recognizing the need for stability, the need to access ceilings to promote trade, the need to have to be able to assure that there is no domestic unrest. So in that segment of our portfolio that we call the core, we think strong execution is the best way to assure future growth. That includes a recapitalization of the F-35, as Bruce has talked about. It includes our ability to provide not only our nation but our friends and allies with very effective systems that can blunt the effect of offensive missiles that are proliferating very rapidly. We have a good family of airlifters, the C-5 domestically, the C-130 internationally. These aircraft are used in all manners of not just military engagements but humanitarian relief, fire fighting missions, all sorts of things. So I think there's growth opportunity in that core business. Additionally, when we think of adjacencies I think Littoral Combat Ship has been 1 of those areas that we regarded as an adjacency over time. I believe there's a commitment to building out a fleet of 55 Littoral Combat Ships domestically, and I think there's considerable and expanding interest in the Littoral Combat Ship internationally. And in that international interest I think there's interest in countries and regions of the world that have the financial capacity to support the program interests that they have. And then on our horizon markets, we think about cybersecurity and energy and health care information technology and we know those markets will mature at different paces. And these are market segments and customers and technology applications with which we have considerable familiarity. So the issue often becomes who you commercialize or, whatever the right words are, will you go into markets where you have less familiarity, where you have less experience with consumer behavior, where you have the different approaches to pricing and risk management? And at this juncture, we don't see any reason to do that. We don't have any plans to do that because we believe strongly in the missions in which we are involved, the need for the capabilities that we and, in some cases, almost only we can provide the critical customers around the globe. And we think that even under difficult discussions about deficit reduction that will occur over a very long period of time, discussions that we absolutely intend to participate in and do our part, there would still be a very compelling need to invest in security in recapitalization and in preparing for a very uncertain future that will determine the well-being of 310 million Americans. And we're very dedicated to that focus. So I don't think you should look to us for having any significant departure from the strategic focus that we have had on our Global Security business. What you should expect from us is to stay focused on execution, to continue to set high standards for cost reduction and quality. And importantly, we need to go out in a demanding marketplace and win new business, and we intend to do that. So for Bruce and Jerry and myself, Sean, thanks for presiding over the call today and for everybody who participated in the call, we appreciate very much your interest and the ability to have this discussion with you. And we look forward to giving you an update at the end of the second quarter. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you, Karen, and good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to our Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.

Bob Stevens: Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. For those on the East Coast, I hope you're digging out of the snowstorm satisfactorily and for all on the call today, I hope you're looking forward to a prosperous 2011 as we are.  I trust you've had the opportunity to read today's earnings release on our fourth quarter results. As the release outlined, operational performance in the fourth quarter continued at a solid rate and enabled us to achieve strong financial results, including over $20 billion in order bookings that expanded our backlog to over $78 billion while achieving sales growth of 5%.  We also continued to generate exceptional cash flow that provided the opportunity to repurchase a record level of over 13 million shares in the quarter, to pay dividends of almost $270 million and to fund $840 million to our pension trust.  This focus on operating cash has been a foundational element of our strategy to provide sustained returns through share repurchases and dividends, while still ensuring appropriate investments in the business, and that approach is working well. Let me start with a very brief strategic update. Over the course of our last several calls, we've described to you our sense of this new reality that we're working in. One characterized by growing complexity in the global security environment and continuing pressures in the world's economy. All that we see reinforces this perspective, and is driving our actions.  As an illustration, just since we last spoke in global security, as our Defense Secretary visited on January 11, the Chinese showcased the pace of their advancement in low observable technologies with the J20 aircraft. In conjunction with previous demonstrations of anti-satellite systems, advances in communications and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, the development of antisurface ship weapons, the expansion of submarine capabilities and persistent cyber campaigns, questions about how China might use its expanding military strength are growing.  Also in the region, it's now estimated that North Korea will likely have an operational ICBM within five years, a prospect Secretary Gates recently called a direct threat to the United States, and one that only adds to the risks associated with an unstable and provocative government. On the economic front, our nation's debt now exceeds $14 trillion, and the recently convened 112th Congress will soon need to address the prospect of increasing the debt ceiling as executive branch agencies contemplate overall spending reductions.  On January 6, Secretary Gates took a step in that direction by presenting a revised DoD future year Defense program, indicating that the President's budget request for government fiscal '12 for the base budget would be set at $553 billion, which represents about $13 billion less than the prior year's estimate but also about 3% real growth over the current continuing resolution, which is set to expire March 4.  The Secretary indicated the rate of real growth in the base defense budget will remain positive in government fiscal '13 and '14 and flatten out in government fiscal '15 and '16. Given the strength, the alignment and the quality of our portfolio, we expect to continue revenue growth through this period, and we continue to refine our strategy. In parallel with the government efficiency drive, we've been executing a series of cost reduction and efficiency initiatives as well. Relative to our portfolio, we successfully completed the divestiture of the Enterprise Integration Group to Veritas Capital for $815 million in cash, and we believe we will likely have an agreement for the sale of our Pacific Architects and Engineers unit by the end of the first quarter 2011.  We continue to take out cost by reducing expenses across the board, particularly in travel, participation in air shows and the like, by carefully scrubbing our capital requirements, by tightening our organizational span of control and improving agility, through actions like the voluntary executive separation program and other measures and by focusing on consolidations to remove excess capacity, optimize facility utilization and efficiently balance our workload.  Most recently, we announced the phased closure of our Egan, Minnesota facility by 2013 and the movement of our contract work from Baltimore, Maryland to other company sites by 2011. While these actions are very difficult for our workforce and we undertake them with a measure of regret, they are necessary to meet the demands of this new reality that we're in. We'll continue to seize opportunities to reduce costs, increase productivity and drive affordability throughout our company and throughout the supply chain.  A significant component of our strategy is to focus on execution as improving quality and predictability while shortening cycle times not only lowers costs and assures that every dollar counts, it puts more critical security capability into our customers’ hands sooner, giving them the tools they need to meet complex global security demands. We also recognize at this critical time of portfolio rebalancing, that it's essential to maintain our focus on cash generation and smart allocation. Our desire to return at least 50% of free cash flow to investors in the form of share repurchases and dividends remains a top priority as does assuring that we invest in the technologies that will give our customers the edge in every mission area. While we're interested in acquisitions, we'll remain very selective, following our string of pearls model, meaning we look for acquisitions of an appropriate size to facilitate smooth integration, appropriate content to contribute to innovation and appropriate value leading to profitable growth.  We'll also continue to look at our pension trust relative to future funding needs. And finally, we'll continue to invest in our people to assure that we have the professional and leadership skills necessary to find success in the demanding environment that we face.  Turning to operational performance. I'll start with Aeronautics where two programs warrant special mention, the F-35 and the C-130J. On the F-35, we continue to see progress across key areas of the program. But like any development effort, challenges certainly remain.  In the flight test program, we completed 141 test flights in the fourth quarter, representing the highest quarterly level achieved to date as the tempo of flights continues to ramp up. For calendar year 2010, we exceeded our planned test goal of 394 flights by completing 410 test flights. But the STOVL aircraft remains the most challenging variant, with 212 flights completed. That's 39 flights behind plan. We're now working with our customers to finalize the test requirements for 2011. While the discussions are not yet complete, we are currently looking at about 872 flights in total. We've flown 36 flights so far this year, and we'll update you when the overall plan is final.  In the key area of software development, the STOVL variant flew with software block 1.0 for the first time in the fourth quarter. This software will serve as the foundational building block for all future avionics software on the F-35. It represents a key step in the process of validating our avionics system and ensuring that it operates in a way that gives our Warfighters a clear advantage over every adversary. Block 1.0 software enables information fusion from the radar, from the electronic warfare system, and from the electro-optical targeting system, and provides initial weapons release capability.  In his announcement of January 6, Secretary Gates identified the Air Force conventional takeoff and landing version and the Navy's carrier version, which represent over 85% of the planned domestic production run as proceeding satisfactorily in development. However, testing challenges and delays on the short takeoff and vertical landing variant resulted in his decision to decouple STOVL testing from the other models, to move the development of the STOVL aircraft to the back of the overall Joint Strike Fighter production sequence, and to place the STOVL version of the airplane effectively on probation.  These actions will better position the STOVL variant to demonstrate improved reliability over the next two years and get the Marine aircraft back on track in terms of performance, cost and schedule. We're completely committed to this course of action and very much appreciate the attention the F-35 is receiving.  Secretary Gates also outlined the recommendations of the technical baseline review, announcing the intention to add $4.6 billion to the F-35 development program over the next five years, extending development to 2016. These funds are to be used for additional development scope, for testing and risk retirement activities that better position the program for production, and to correct prior estimates.  The government fiscal year '12 production buy, our Lot 5 procurement will be budgeted at 32 aircraft, and the production ramp rate for future production launch was set at 1.5, meaning 150% growth in quantity lot over lot. Since the Lot 4 quantity recently placed under contract was also for 32 aircraft, the near-term flattening of lot to lot quantities, that's 32 aircraft in Lot 4 and 32 aircraft in Lot 5 does not support the planned cost reductions that are associated with lot to lot quantity increases and learning curve efficiencies. However, we do believe that with the total quantities of aircraft to be procured, we and our customers have ample opportunity to focus on overall affordability objectives, and we will. Turning to the C-130J program, we continued to advance both with additional new business awards and increased annual production levels. The government of South Korea became the 14th country to select the C-130J with a contract for four new airlifters, bringing the total number of C-130J aircraft ordered since inception to 300. We also delivered nine aircraft in the quarter, bringing our full-year production to 25 airplanes, about 50% higher than our 2009 level. With a current annual production capacity of 36 aircraft, we have the ability to satisfy robust domestic and international demand.  In Electronic Systems, the team finished the year with a solid quarter across the portfolio. Noteworthy fourth quarter items centered on two areas: the Littoral Combat Ship and Missile Defense activities. In late December, the United States Navy awarded us a contract to construct the first of up to 10 Littoral Combat Ships through 2015, an award with an overall potential value of approximately $3.6 billion. On the production front, our second vessel, the Fort Worth, was successfully launched in December and remains on cost and on schedule with more than 80% of construction completed. LCS was highlighted by Secretary Gates as a program deserving additional U.S. investment and in this new reality of tight budgets, will offer domestic and international navies a highly capable, cost-effective system.  In ballistic Missile Defense, we received a contract for over $900 million to provide Patriot missile defense systems to the United States, to Taiwan and to the United Arab Emirates, further expanding the global footprint of this proven system. Additionally, the United States Navy awarded a contract to produce Aegis weapons systems for the DDG-113 destroyer with options for two additional destroyer systems. This contract also provides options for an Aegis Ashore system that will adapt the sea-based capability to a land-based system to protect the United States and allied troops in Europe against the ballistic missile threats. Finally, operationally, the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System was used by the Japanese Navy to successfully intercept and destroy a target, further illustrating the capabilities of this fielded system.  Moving to Information Systems & Global Solutions. Our team achieved two key events in the quarter that deserve special merit. Under the $1.4 billion ten-year ID/IQ contract for the national airspace system integration effort, a contract known as NISC III, IS&GS will compete for task quarters to provide a broad range of information technology support to the Federal Aviation Administration. IS&GS will serve as the prime contractor in this effort and will build upon their prior experience under the NISC II contract.  I also wanted to congratulate our team on their successful completion and delivery of the 2010 census data for the United States government. This effort represents the successful processing of over 165 million census forms and is an essential tool used by our government to determine, among other things, the number of Congressional seats appropriate for states and the correct allocation of federal funds to state and local governments.  In Space Systems, the United States Air Force awarded a $1.4 billion contract for the fourth Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite. This award expands the current contract from three satellites to four and follows the outline in last year's Quadrennial Defense Review to potentially award up to six advanced DHF Satellites. Importantly, the Air Force announced that it intends to purchase satellites in block buys to lower the acquisition cost. We believe this approach is an exceedingly smart way to buy these systems in a fashion that will significantly contribute to affordability objectives, and we applaud Air Force leadership on this initiative.  Also in Space, our decades-long support of the Trident 2 missile continue to be recognized with an award of a contract for over $900 million to manufacture new missiles and provide related support services to this critical element of national security and deterrence.  Finally, I have described for you many times my admiration for the quality of our leadership and our workforce. I was very pleased to see five Lockheed Martin employees recently recognized as Fellows of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. They are Dr. Ray Johnson, Mr. Frank Cappuccio, Dr. Stephen Engelstad, Mr. Jeffrey Hamstra, and Dr. Pradeep Raj. They are exceptional leaders, and I was gratified to see their talent and contributions widely recognized inside and outside our corporation.  I'll turn the call now over to Bruce who will provide some additional detail on our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for 2011. Bruce?
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob outlined, our financial performance in the fourth quarter was both strong and broad based, and as I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please refer to the Web charts we included today.  Let's begin with Chart 3, our 2010 orders. Orders in the quarter were over $20 billion and were strong across all business areas. Most visible awards were the finalization of the F-35 LRIP 4 contract and the first of potentially 10 LCS ships. But you can see every business area has large awards in the quarter. For the full year, orders were nearly $47 billion, which represents the highest annual order level in our history. And I think this is a good indication of the alignment of our portfolio with the needs and requirements of our customer. Turning to Chart 4, and a look at our ending backlog. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.6 and that resulted in growing our backlog by $1 billion during 2010 to our year-end level of over $78 billion. On the right-hand side of the chart, it's noteworthy to see the duration of backlog for a number of our major programs, particularly if you consider unexercised options that are beyond what's included in our current backlog amounts.  Moving to Chart 5, and our sales for the quarter. Overall, the corporation grew 5% in the quarter, with Aeronautics was particularly strong with 19% growth, driven by increases in both the F-35 and C-130 program sales. Electronic Systems performance was stronger in the quarter than we expected, resulting in the business exceeding the upper end of its guidance range for the year.  Overall, three of the four business areas showed growth in the quarter with Space Systems showing a decline due to the absence this year of several large milestone driven sales events that occurred last year. Looking at our full-year sales growth on Chart 6. Total growth for the corporation was 4%. Aeronautics also grew the fastest for the year at 8% growth, followed by Electronic Systems at 6% and IS&GS at 4%. Space Systems was lower this year by 5% due to lower Orion sales and the wind down of external tank activities for the shuttle program.  Moving to Chart 7. Our earnings per share for 2010 was $7.18 from continuing operations, significantly higher than the outlook we provided to you in our last earnings call. The increase was seen in three main areas. Operational improvements, largely driven by the stronger performance in Electronic Systems resulted in $0.12 per share increase. Passage of the R&D tax credit provided another $0.12 improvement and other improvements in our tax provisions partially offset by the facility consolidation charge Electronic Systems and all other items netted to another $0.09 benefit.  Chart 8 is a summary of our cash generation for the year. As Bob mentioned, our cash flow was very strong this year, and we achieved a record level of cash generation of $5.8 billion before pension contributions, almost 25% more than 2009 levels. As we outlined to you in October earnings call, we made over $2.2 billion in discretionary contributions to pension plans in 2010, bringing the funding level in our plants to over 80% as measured on a ERISA basis. At this level, our plans are sufficiently funded under the requirements of the Pension Protection Act to avoid any determination of the plans being turned at risk.  Overall, our cash from operations was $3.6 billion and in addition, we received over $800 million from the close of our sales at EIG business allowing us the flexibility to make both our pension contributions and continue our strong cash deployment practices, which brings us to our next chart.  Chart 9 highlights the significant level of free cash returned to our shareholders in 2010. Overall, we returned $3.5 billion, an increase of 25% more than 2009 levels. Share repurchases were $2.5 billion, more than 30% above 2009. Dividends returned almost $1 billion, reflecting the 19% increase in our quarterly dividend rate announced in October, which brought our annual dividend amount to $3 per share. Chart 10 shows our share repurchase levels in the quarter and for the year. For the quarter, we repurchased 13.2 million shares, the highest quarterly level in our history and double the amount we repurchased last year in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased 33 million shares also the highest annual level in our history. The record level of share repurchases reduced our share count significantly as seen on the next chart.  Chart 11 shows the level of our share repurchase activities since 2005. We reduced over 7% of our outstanding shares in the year again, the highest percentage of share count reduction since implementing our repurchase program in 2002. The 346 million shares outstanding at the end of the year represents the lowest level in our history and reflect nearly a 20% reduction in share count over the last five years. And we have over $2 billion remaining in the share repurchase program authorized by our board in 2010. Now turning to our financial outlook for 2011 as shown on Chart 12. As we discussed last quarter, we expect 2011 sales to grow at a low single-digit rate with segment operating profit remaining fairly flat with 2010 levels. We're now showing an improved FAS/CAS adjustment, primarily due to a higher discount rate than we assumed last quarter. I'll give more details on this change in an upcoming chart.  Earnings per share from continuing operations are projected between $6.70 and $7 per share, and I'm especially pleased that our cash from operations guidance has risen to $4 billion, significantly higher than what we've previously outlined. I should also point out that we are assuming at least $1 billion in share repurchases in 2011 and that our guidance assumes a timely resolution of the FY '11 Defense Appropriation Bill this year.  On Chart 13, we'll discuss segment guidance for sales and operating profit by business area. Aeronautics should have sales growth in the upper single digit range with operating profit projected to increase at a mid-single digit rate above 2010 levels, reflecting the ongoing transition from higher margin production fighter programs to the lower margin development and LRIP activities on the F-35 program.  In terms of phasing for the year, I'd expect sales to be heavier in the second half of the year as aircraft deliveries are planned that way. C-130 deliveries are likely to be weighted 1/3 in the first half and 2/3 in the second half, while F-16s will be about 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half.  Electronic Systems is expected to have slightly lower sales due to the completion of the persistent threat detection system activity last year. The delay the timing of awards such as LCS and FAS production, all of which are partially offset by growth in the SOFSA CLS contract.  Margins are expected to be similar to the level in 2010. Phasing of sales for Electronic Systems will be fairly consistent across the four quarters, trending slightly higher in the second half. IS&GS sales will be lower in 2011 due to the completion of the U.S. census work in 2010, while margins will be similar to what we experienced last year. Sales will likely phase lower in the first quarter and first half due to the absence of the census program in 2011. Finally, Space Systems revenues are also projected to be flat compared with 2010 results due to the wind down of shuttle activity, offset by growth in satellite activities. Segment operating profit is expected to be down slightly due to the wind down of shuttle activity, and phasing of sales for the year should be fairly consistent across the four quarters except for the timing of two planned commercial satellite deliveries in the second and fourth quarters.  Looking now at Chart 14, as I highlighted earlier our FAS/CAS adjustment to earnings has significantly improved from our initial assessment in the last call. The new guidance for 2011 is a $925 million headwind on projected earnings rather than the $1.2 billion level we indicated in October.  Drivers of the improvement were discount rates increasing 50 basis points to 5.5%, higher than the 5% estimate we provided in October. Our actual return on assets was over 13% in 2010 versus our assumption of 8.5%; and with the largest swing in our FAS/CAS estimate resulting from the change in our discount rate, this highlights the sensitivity of our GAAP earnings to the volatility of rapidly changing interest rates, rather than the fundamental economics of our business. Turning to Chart 15. You can see the significant year-to-year headwind, the increased pension expense creates on our EPS from continuing operations. Removing the FAS/CAS impact from both 2010 and 2011 shows growth in adjusted EPS of about 8% at the midpoint of our 2011 guidance.  In our final chart, Chart 16, I'd like to offer my perspective on how well Lockheed Martin is positioned within the industry and as a stock ownership opportunity.  As I see it, there are four key reasons why our stock represents good value proposition. First, we have a strong dividend yield of nearly 4%. Second, we have a strong history of consistent share repurchases, averaging more than 4% annual reductions in our share count over the last five years, and more than 5% over the last three years. Third, while our cash generation over the past few years has been strong despite the large discretionary payments we made to our pension plans, those significant cash outflows will eventually swing to cash inflows as our reimbursements catch up to and surpass our required contributions.  And finally there's no program in the DoD budget that has the growth potential of the F-35 program going forward.  With that, I think we're ready for questions. Karen?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes on the line of Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: I have a Joint Strike Fighter question that is a joint question itself. I think it's for both Bob and Bruce. I wanted to ask you, Bob, you went through the restructuring alluded to by Secretary Gates back in the earlier part of the month. And the push to the right some of the timing on some of the lots, redirection of some funds into R&D, et cetera, and you talked about the fact that this is going to perhaps move savings initiatives toward the life of the program. It won't be able to target some learning curve-wise earlier on. So I'd like to ask you how we should think about Joint Strike Fighter revenue and margins over the four- to five-year period the Secretary was referring to relative to your earlier expectations?
Bob Stevens: So you have a sense of where we are in Lot 4 and while Lot 5 is proposed at 32 airplanes as is the typical process throughout the fiscal year, the Congress will review the request for 32 airplanes, and they will have deliberation if they will make a decision hopefully within the authorization and appropriation bill that supports the quantity to be purchased. When we think of overall pricing revenue of affordability, margins, we think that it will be exceedingly difficult on the affordability front to get near-term cost reduction opportunities without near-term volume increases, because volume increases are so intimately related to our ability and really, the industry's ability to drive down learning curves. So we're seeing a bit of a slowdown in the near-term ramp. We fully reflected our expectations in the near term in the 2011 guidance as we look forward learn more about the Congressional actions. We'll be sure to update our guidance accordingly and keep you well advised.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS.
David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank: Bruce, a quick question for you. What is assumed in your guidance for share repurchases at this point?
Bruce Tanner: $1 billion.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rick Safran of Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran - Goldman Sachs: I wanted to ask you about cash. So given that cash flow came in meaningfully higher in 2010 than you expected and given the strength of bookings, et cetera, does that kind of imply there may be upside to your $4 billion cash guidance and also as a kind of like a second part, just wanted to know what the current thinking is about dividends versus buybacks and by that, what I'm asking is there a potential here, for example, for more meaningful or higher dividend raises than we've seen previously?
Bruce Tanner: Rich, why don't I take a shot at this and see if Bob has anything to add at the end to it. You're right. Cash flow was very strong in 2010. I was particularly pleased if you take a look at all four business areas relative to what our expectations were as we entered the year, all four business areas exceeded those expectations. You may recall we were contemplating during 2010 some increase in our working capital throughout the year. We actually ended the year relatively flat, so we did not have that increase, and we were also expecting a slight increase in working capital as we headed into 2011, which we're now believing will be flatter still. So that, in particular, is what drove the cash higher in 2010 and gives us the confidence to increase the number to $4 billion in 2011. You talked about the orders. I was extremely pleased with orders again, $20 billion in the quarter, especially considering it's a quarter that's under continuing resolution. And the fact that, that led to $47 billion for the year, which is the highest level of orders we've ever had as a corporation I think is a testimony to the alignment of our portfolio with the requirements and needs, again, that the customer’s needs. And so if you're asking about the dividends versus buyback if there's a change there, we remain committed to the 50% return of free cash to shareholders as we've stated numerous times. Obviously, we have the firepower that we've demonstrated especially in the fourth quarter to continue the share repurchase and the dividend increase. We always revisit the dividends with our Board of Directors some time in the third quarter time frame of the year. We'll do that, again, this year and I think in short, Rich, we'll be opportunistic especially on the share buyback. And we'll revisit the dividend policy in the third quarter with our Board, which is what we always do.
Bob Stevens: Rich, I'll only add that we spend a significant amount of time focusing on cash generation because we recognize that is the single most significant source of our ability to run this business effectively and return value to investors. We like the balanced approach with our share repurchase program and our dividend increases that you've seen of us lately. I think if we're able to continue to generate cash flow in a superior fashion, we'd like to follow through with more of those actions.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Could you tell us what you expect the tax rate to be for 2011 in a quarterly pattern? And secondly, you gave us a delivery pattern for your aircraft in 2011. But some times in the past, changes within a model from one customer to another have resulted in different margins. So should we expect that the aeronautical margins will start out low and get better as we go through the year? Is there any kind of visible pattern there?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, let me try to address the first question. First, obviously, Cai, tax rates we're expecting next year on a recurring basis are probably going to be about the 30% level. I wouldn't expect to see large changes quarter-to-quarter. I think that was part of your question as well. And I would not expect that. Phasing of the aircraft is going to be a little back-end loaded within Aeronautics. Again, as I said, for both F-16s and C-130s. I don't think, margin-wise, I'm trying to recall at the top of my head the quarterly spread of our margins within Aeronautics. I don't believe you're going to see a whole lot of changes other than I'll say the normal sort of risk retirement items as we progress down the production of all these aircraft. But from a planning perspective, from a guidance perspective, I don't see that, that I'd point out to you at this point in time.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Bob, the F-35 SDD contract is something I think I'd asked you about one or two of the past two to three quarters and I just want to ask again as to where you are.  My guess is that it impacted the margins here in the fourth quarter in Aeronautics, although that may have just been mix. But my guess is there's an SDD issue there. And it seems to me and I'd like your view on this as well, this may be sort of a sore spot in the relationship between Lockheed and DoD right now. So I know you don't want to take a bad deal, of course, but if you could just update us there on how you're thinking about it and where we are.
Bob Stevens: Yes, I will say that we started and finished the year in SDD at the same booking rate. So we can clarify that at the outset. There isn't really a sore point or sore spot in our discussions regarding the SDD program with the Department. Not about the opportunity for fee or profitability, it's all about focusing on assuring we're doing the right things at the right time to deliver three variants of the Joint Strike Fighter. And I honestly believe we see that reflected in the amount of time the Secretary of Defense has directly spent in reviewing and discussing the circumstances surrounding the F-35. For a Secretary of Defense to be literate and conversationally competent about the details of the technical baseline review is a significantly important thing to us, because we share a same goal. And the goal is to deliver this airplane as quickly as we can and as affordably as we can because when all of us look at the complex changes in the global security environment, we see an increasing need to have this airplane sooner for three services in the United States and certainly, for regional friends and allies who live in areas that have expanding difficulties. So there are not really contentious discussions here. They are full-throated views about how we should remedy some of the issues we're finding in the test program, but it's done professionally, it's done constructively. And I will say of all the observations that have been talked about that are developing in the system design and development phase, all the test areas that need correction, we're working cooperatively. Every one of those areas is being evaluated by subject matter experts in the government. Most of them have approved corrective actions in place and we're executing against those corrective action plans. And the ones that don't have them approved have them in development and review. So I think we're going to increase the momentum and the tempo of the program, including the flight test program, including software development. We're all steering towards the same course, and we all share the same objectives.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned at Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: I want to continue on the F-35 because some of the statements that, Bob, you've made in the past and even today suggest that you think that you could go to higher rates than what the Secretary is talking about in the restructured plan. And what I'm interested in is understanding what is the source of that difference in views. And then also although I understand that you're ahead on both the A model and the C model in terms of flight test, what are the challenges you face there beyond just the number of flight tests to push this forward and be on schedule, I would say, on every aspect of this programs?
Bob Stevens: Well, let's talk about production capacity first. We've facilitized the Joint Strike Fighter line to accelerate at a rate faster than 1.5. That's true. And we've done that, in concert with our government customers, in full cooperation. I think the Department of Defense is providing their best professional judgment after, undoubtedly, one of the most thorough reviews that any program has ever had with the results of the technical baseline review. What is a prudent, near-term 1.5 escalation in quantity year-over-year. I'm sure in the future, that will be reviewed again based on our performance. We accept that 1.5 rate now. We have a lot of areas of interest that we have to go focus on. The F-35, I think it's important to remember when we're talking about volume now, we're talking about U.S. government volume, and the F-35 has an extraordinary international potential business base here. And expressions of international interest have been increasing. So I would submit to you, Doug, that if we're able to execute on a plan that allows everybody to build confidence and that certainly is our commitment, then just as we've had periodic reviews of the program to date that have resulted in some adaptations to the program, there can be similar adaptations increasing the ramp rate. We have an independent manufacturing review team that periodically looks at our manufacturing productive capability. And I'm sure they have been flexible and wise in their judgment thus far, and they'll be that way looking forward. You asked about the A model and the C model and the flight test program. We look at this, I think, in general terms in a couple of pieces. One is assuring that we're demonstrating the flying qualities of really all three variants and the STOVL variant is in the flight test program and it is showing signs of the improved performance, that's an area we're going to concentrate on intensely but it doesn't mean we lowered our concentration on the conventional version or the carrier version. There's also a software development program, and I think you know we're developing software in three blocks. The blocks have interim releases called A and B. We've released software Block 1.0. We continue to write the other software blocks. We have to synchronize the software block delivery with the capabilities being demonstrated in the flight test program so that we can continue to expand the envelope and continue to move these jets closer toward initial operational capability. And then there's another piece for preparation for training because the jets have to be inserted into a training program with pilots in a curriculum to also prepare them for the initial operational capability. So you can get a feel from this of why it is absolutely so vitally important for us to stay in lockstep with our government customers with the Joint Program Offices, with the services, with the Systems commands, who bring the engineering talent and the subject matter expertise forward. It is a large program. It does have complexity. But in that size and complexity, there's a lot of strength and experience and judgment that is all dedicated to getting this program right. We're very gratified for that level of cooperation. So there's a lot of moving parts. Sometimes they don't all move in exactly the way we want them to. But generally that movement is forward. We're showing progress, and we're going to continue to apply all the resources we have to make this a successful program.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
Jason Gursky - Citigroup: Just a quick bookkeeping question. All things equal, how will pension expense trend into '12 and '13 and then maybe just a clarification on some things that you've chatted about in the past, which is what you would view as full rate production on the F-35 program and the year in which we might get there and the level of revenues that one might expect once we reach full-rate production.
Bruce Tanner: Jason, I'll tackle pension question first. You asked about going forward in '12 and '13 and the way we always characterize it is if things don't change from current assumptions so kind of current course of the speed, the same discount rate and same long-term asset return rate 8.5% and 5.5% for the discount rate. I would expect that the FAS/CAS adjustment from some $925 million headwind in 2011 will drop very dramatically in 2012 being -- maybe think of it as maybe a couple of hundred million dollars or a little more maybe of headwind in 2012. And then I would think they would flip in 2013. So we've actually got a bit of a tailwind at that timeframe. Now all this is dependent upon and I'm trying to predict when this is going to happen, I've been unsuccessful with those predictions in the past but all this is predicated on when CAS harmonization occurs and its impact on the CAS recovery there. We are assuming when I say that, that will occur in 2012. And as far as full-rate production, I'm going to ask Bob to give some comments on that.
Bob Stevens: Yes, Jason, it's been a while since we talked about moving to full-rate production because our focus has been so much on the system design development and phase and Low-Rate Initial Production. But at the last time we had these discussions, we were looking at ramping up to the neighborhood of about 200 airplanes a year. We were talking in terms of about one a day. I don't see any reason assuming that we resolve the issues that are before us now and continue to execute and demand stays strong for the program, which we believe it will. That's probably the range of the neighborhood that we'll be looking toward. Relative to timing, we really need to have the jets proceed through initial operational capability before we get to those levels of full-rate production. That time line now is in the neighborhood of 2016 or so. The services are examining the dates that would be appropriate for their initial operational capability. So I think the short answer is in the 200-a-year range, and we don't go to full rate until after IOC and that date today is about 2016.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch: Maybe changing the subject a little bit away from F-35. On Littoral Combat Ship, you won the recent award domestically. Is there an export market for the vehicle and can you expound on that?
Bob Stevens: Well, we think there is an export market for the Littoral Combat Ship. The Government of Saudi Arabia has expressed some interest very directly in the performance characteristics of the ship, and they're looking to modernize their Eastern fleet. So there is a prospect there. We've had some additional, I'd say inquiries, as to the suitability of the Littoral Combat Ship. I think international customers want to get some more information about the vessel, and I think they were honestly looking to see what the award would actually look like in its final manifestation. And that award just took place at the end of December. The Littoral Combat Ship is the size and class of vessel that we think will be of considerable interest to many navies because most navies don't really have very substantial tonnage in their ships. And of course, the modular configuration of the ship, the ability to reconfigure it in near real time with different mission modules for different tasks, I think will have great appeal. And then as we look to the future, we'll look at evolving the ship's capability, for example, for ballistic Missile Defense capabilities and actually, we are interested in listening to potential customers as to how they might want to customize or reconfigure the vessel for very specific mission purposes. The ship was really built to have additional flexibility, small crew, high performance, use information technology wisely, and that allows us to reconfigure it and customize it in various ways. So I do think it will have some interesting international opportunities. We'll look for them and we'll be sure to keep you posted as these matters mature.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: First just a clarification, Bruce, on the FAS/CAS for '12, you're saying it's a $200 million FAS/CAS adjustment, not a $200 million headwind to the $925 million, is that right?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Let me be more precise than I, obviously, was when I first answered. So $925 million headwind in 2011, and that's dropping dramatically to about $200 million headwind, not additive to the $925 million in 2012.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: The real question I have is on, maybe for Bob, on the F-35. The STOVL production adjustment relative to the rates, relatively anticipated given the testing of your rebaselining there, but I'm curious how you think, how we should think about the Air Force's decision to cut its buy about 20%. And I mean, is this -- it seems like the testing was going well, it seems like the Air Force is rhetoric and strong. Just curious how we should interpret this.
Bob Stevens: Because I am sensitive to some of these discussions, I don't want to overly clarify your comment, the Air Force didn't cut the volume of their buy. They rescheduled the rate at which they'll acquire the CTOL, so the totals still look the same. I have great empathy for the Secretary of Defense and the leadership in the Pentagon, who are looking at load-balancing in a period of this new reality that they see, too. There are fiscal challenges that they face, there are security challenges they face. They are going to be compelled to do more without having more resources in given fiscal years, and I think they're simply trying to make the right decisions and balance their load. I'm absolutely confident that as we continue to make progress on the Joint Strike Fighter, including the conventional takeoff and landing version, when we demonstrate that the airplane can fly effectively, that we're burning down our test points, that we're meeting our flight test schedules, that we're delivering software on schedule and we're meeting the milestones in reparation for training, the Air Force strongly desires to begin to phase the Joint Strike Fighter into the inventory. I'm absolutely confident of that. I think I have the same confidence for the United States Navy, and I certainly have it with the United States Marine Corps. As I mean with the Commandant of the Marine Corps with some regularity, he is personally and substantially involved as a service chief in taking ownership and accountability for getting Marine aviation the F-35B version. He measures performance on a weekly basis. I couldn't ask for a higher level of partnership, and it’s circumstances like that, when we focus together with the same set of metrics, with great transparency on what we've accomplished and what we have yet to accomplish, that progress will be born. And so I'm really confident that we're going to be able to meet our milestones and as we demonstrate the milestones, there'll be greater confidence in the airplane and actions will flow accordingly.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: A sideline non-aero question for just a second. Can you give us an update on what your percentage of international sales were in 2010. And, Bob, highlight for us the major campaigns you see in 2011 and are you seeing international demand rising? Or is it flat vis-à-vis last year? Or are you seeing its tail off?
Bruce Tanner: Heidi, I'll answer the international sales question. We ended the year right about 15% sales going to international customers, and that's in line with what at least I have talked about in previous calls about trying to grow that amount over the next two or three years up to 20%. I think we're on a good path to do that, and I would think we will see that transition from where we are today about 15% to 20% ratably over the next couple of years.
Bob Stevens: And, Heidi, when we think of International business, we think there'll be greater opportunities there for sure. I mentioned in the remarks, when the call opened, some changes in the global security landscape that I think some people may have reacted to with surprise but not everyone. It's very clear that technologies continue to proliferate. Countries and individuals continue to make investments and sadly, the threats that people face have not diminished in their entirety. When we look at the maturity of our portfolio, the quality of our products and frankly, the reputation that we enjoy globally, say, in our Aeronautics portfolio with airplanes like the F-16 and the C-130J, and I believe the F-35 will take its position right alongside really venerable programs in aircraft like that. There's a very high level of interest in securing these kinds of assets, and I think individuals recognize as we increase our production rate, we lower our cost, our quality is good. When they're thinking of affordability, this is a very opportune time to think about recapitalization needs along those lines of business. With the proliferation of missile systems, Missile Defense capabilities become preeminent. We have the Patriot system. We have the FAD system. We have the MEADS system. We have the Aegis system including Aegis Ashore. These are very robust, very proven technologies. Individuals don't take a great deal of programmatic risk, and I think they get a great deal of protection. It seems to us that international opportunities will vary perhaps a little less so in Europe for perhaps obvious economic reasons, but probably more so in the Middle East and more so in the Asia-Pacific theater. We're concentrating our efforts there. We're getting substantial inquiries from those areas.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I guess one other question, which just I think what where Heidi might have been going is, I don't know if there are specific campaigns you can highlight that we might be watching as we go through the course of 2011, and you had a pretty strong fourth quarter order rate. Do you think you'll be able to get a book-to-bill up at 1x as we look through 2011?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, let me talk about the -- Sam, if I could, this is Bruce. Let me talk about the phasing of backlog. Last year, we had -- I'll say that even distribution of orders across the four quarters, we actually dropped down to what, $71 million of backlog in the third quarter before we had the $20 billion in the fourth quarter. I think what we'll see in 2011 is a much more even spread, I mean, in fact as we're looking here the first quarter might actually end up a little bit even higher than where we ended the year. And then we may drop down a bit. Third quarter always seems to be our low point for the year, and I still think we'll end up the year either equal to or slightly higher than we ended the year 2010 with. And then, I'll maybe the start the bidding with the international opportunities and say, probably first and foremost, the C-130 sale to the UAE is likely going to be a first quarter, maybe early second quarter event. That'll be, think about a dozen or so C-130s. We're still hopeful that we can have some time this year some interest from the government of Iraq on an F-16 buy. And obviously – maybe not obviously - but one of the bigger ones we're counting on later in the year is the UAE FAD program. And I'll throw it over to Bob and if see he has anything else. Bob?
Bob Stevens: So, Sam, I would only reinforce those are the most active campaigns probably the UAE FAD is the most substantial with regard to Missile Defense.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Gleacher and Company.
Peter Arment - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Bob, could you give us an update on Lockheed Martin's portfolios shaping? You came into 2010 and you made some two significant announcements and it sounds like PAE is going to close very soon or at some point here in the first quarter, and I know when you're rolling up your 2011 plan, you'd take a very hard look at this. Could you give us an update on that?
Bob Stevens: Peter, we have taken a very careful look. We like the portfolio that we have very much. As I mentioned, we're always looking to acquisitions but they really have to pass some pretty stringent tests of adding creativity, innovation, capability that we don't have today, the right size, the right value. We look at a lot of prospective acquisitions. We don't pursue a lot of prospective acquisitions, and we're going to continue to be selective. On the divestiture side, we don't have anything else in queue beyond PA&E. We did a very thorough assessment that led to the divestitures of EIG and PA&E. I think our focus will be on assuring we run a very tight shop here. Cost reduction, and there is no area or no element of our cost structure that we will fail to look at to see if we can get efficiency improvements and productivity. Recently, we announced the closing of Egan, as I mentioned, and some repositioning work out of Baltimore. We'll continue to look at ways to optimize ourselves with respect to the portfolio internally. I will say, we very much like the portfolio that we have in an environment where global security demands are increasing, in areas where we have demonstrated expertise, where affordability matters and we know economically there are increasingly scarce resources. It is why we are so focused on assuring we have sufficient volume and program continuity to allow us to continue to drive down learning curves to give customers real value. So I would tell you today I really like where our portfolio sits.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Bob, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the -- you guys targeting adjacent markets. In the past, you've talked about that but you really didn't address it in your strategy discussion going forward, is there a less of a focus on that? Or does that just kind of fall into the acquisitions category?
Bob Stevens: No. Well, I thought the Littoral Combat Ship was representative of our interest in successful pursuit of opportunities in the adjacent market. And frankly, I don't talk about Littoral Combat Ship with adjacencies anymore because it's not. It's a core product line for our company, and that's how we build the core of the business and we're pleased with that. I will tell you that when we explored the market on the horizon for energy opportunities, we still have a keen interest in those areas, in cybersecurity, in health care information technology. Let me say our judgment about the quality in those markets is that it's maturing with some differential. A little slower than we anticipated, we think there are reasons for that deceleration. It doesn't mean our interest has diminished, but we're not going to lower our standards and pursue initiatives in areas where we don't believe we can be successful and I mean completely successful in delivering value to customers, running an efficient and good operation that we're proud of, that's good for our employees and generating the kind of financial returns that will more than satisfy our investors. I'll return to the quality of the portfolio that we do have. We believe we have a sufficiently strong and well-integrated core business portfolio here so as to continue to generate profitable growth from that core. We want to focus on generating cash. As we generate cash, it gives us considerable latitude to make wise investment decisions. We invest considerably in innovative technology inside our company, in business ventures with other organizations who bring value added either in the quality of their portfolio or their customer points of presence. And we have done that over the last year. I think of that as enriching the pipeline for future innovation and future opportunities. If we can't find acquisitions that make a lot of sense or investment areas in these adjacent or horizon markets, where we have high degrees of confidence that we're going to return good value to investors, we'll continue to pursue our share buyback program, our dividend program. We feel we have enough degrees of freedom to continue to generate economic value while we pursue superior position in the marketplaces. So we're going to build on the core portfolio that we have.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: I have a cash flow question that's sort of two parts. Bob, the first part of it has to do with sort of contracts and the terms and conditions that you're seeing. And then the second part of it, Bruce, is could you give us a little more detail on how you got to the $4 billion in operating cash flow? I realized that D&A is probably $700 million-plus and net it's probably $2.5 billion and so there's obviously, there's some working capital or some other items making a difference there.
Bob Stevens: Well, the terms and conditions, Howard, tend to orient around performance-based payments or progress payments on U.S. government contracts. There's been a little bit more discussion about shifting the balance a bit from performance-based payments to progress-based payments, I think we've seen that a little bit but not in any wholesale way. So our cash flow projections include the balance that we're experiencing and our projection of where that balance might go on those two cash-recovery mechanisms. I will tell you that a great credit to Bruce and the finance team. We spend a lot of time and focus and attention on refining the cash collection cycle here, and our focus on working capital but really focusing on demonstrating value. And when you talk about contract terms and conditions, it's important for us to work contract descriptions where customers know they're receiving value and can therefore, release the cash with confidence. And I think our cash generation capacity is reflective of the system that's working pretty well. I hope that answers the feel you wanted to get for the mechanics of cash flow, and I'll turn the balance over to Bruce.
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Back to your question on how we are getting to the $4 billion. I'd point to maybe two things that I see improvements on going forward. Some of which happened in 2010. As I said, I think some are going to carry over into 2011. One is as we start to see international contracts, back to Heidi's question on the level of International business we're doing, that will grow over the next two years, including 2011 and with that International business I think we'll see some customer advances coming to fruition. And secondly, the thing I'd point to is we've done I think a very, very nice job here recently in 2010 throughout the year. And I suspect we can still do a little better, particularly in the accounts receivable area, where I think in particular the IS&GS business area has had a tremendous focus on improving that. That's where a lot of -- just to be blunt, most of our other business areas tend to get most of their cash collections from a single payment office or a few payment offices within the federal government. Often times, that is the payment offices in Ohio. IS&GS has literally multitudes of payment offices because of their multitude of customers, and I think we've done a very good job of putting that kind focus on collecting those across that mixture of payment offices such that we're getting better returns and quicker payments of our cash than we previously were seeing, and I think that's going to continue into 2011. So I believe that those two things as the main drivers.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Access 342.
George Shapiro - Citi: Two-part question. One, I wanted to know whatever happened to the $600 million process pool for the SDD program that was, I guess, reset to different milestones and then the second is, why in the LRIP 4 contract wasn't there a contingency put in there in case production rates didn't grow as expected, given that there was clearly some risks that, that would have happened in the budget environment that we're in.
Bob Stevens: Well, let me talk to first, George, about the $614 million. We still have not finalized the discussion on any perspective reallocation of the $614 million as it relates to an award fee pool for work done under the system design and development contract. Let me also add that when we contemplate the prospective addition of $4.6 billion in the over target baseline that Secretary Gates mentioned, and I say prospective because we just haven't worked that into the contract, yet. In so as far as that $4.6 billion relates to the extension of effort already under contract, it won't carry an incremental fee with it. The $614 million was an award fee pool beyond that $4.6 billion. It has not been allocated on milestones yet. I think that conversation will begin shortly as we fold in, the revised program plan, establish milestones and do this in a very discreet way. Conversations will conclude on the appropriate size of that pool and the allocation of that pool to specific milestones. I can't answer you with greater detail because we don't have greater details. As soon as we get it, we will describe it to you. On the second part of your question was on Lot 4 having a condition about the quantities in Lot 5. We don't believe the performance environment on Lot 4 is going to be adversely impacted by the quantity on Lot 5 and don't need provision in the contract as such.
Bruce Tanner: George, I'll add one thing to that. If you consider the growth that we're going to see on the SDD contract the $4.6 billion that Bob talked about, there will be some overlap obviously, and the cost profile of that SDD extension and the shortfall from the production contracts that will help to mitigate a lot of that impact on our LRIP 4.
Operator: Our final question for today comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of SunTrust.
Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: Bruce, I just want to follow up with you on earlier question on out-year pension projections. Given we may have a $1.5 trillion deficit now, can you give us your out-year pension projections under the scenario where cash amortizations may be delayed a year or two?
Bruce Tanner: In terms of FAS/CAS, Pete, I'm not sure.
Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: Correct.
Bruce Tanner: Again, we've talked about $925 million. I should have like Myles Walton answer this question. He's probably got the numbers as well as I do at this point. But with current discount rate and the current asset return, again, we think the FAS/CAS in '12 will go down to about a couple of hundred million dollars as opposed to the $925 million.
Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: That's under cash harmonization actually happening, correct?
Bruce Tanner: Your question is, would CAS Harmonization happening.
Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: Yes. What would be the net expense of cash Harmonization doesn't happen or it slides out a year or two.
Bruce Tanner: I think the impact of 2011 as I recall was about $100-ish million or so when we pushed CAS Harmonization out. My guess, since it's another year later, it’s probably a couple of hundred million dollars if it we were to push out from 2012. I tell you that's what I think we and the industry, we're going to be looking for that to happen. I think we've delayed that beyond what was originally contemplated when the Pension Protection Act was put in place. We were carved out very specifically, a large defense contractors as needing an adjustment to the CAS as a result of the PPA requirements, and that's one that I think as an industry and we, Lockheed Martin, will look to have coverage for in 2012.
Bob Stevens: Well, Karen, we've gone a little long on the call. Let me thank everybody for the additional time. Certainly thank you for your questions. We appreciate your thoughts. We're going to go focus on execution here, and we look forward to keeping you well informed as to the progress that we're making. Again, thank you for your time today. Karen, thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator:  Good day, and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher:
 : Thank you, Jevon, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to welcome you to our third quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to remind you the Statements made in today’s call are not historical fact or considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of Federal Securities law.

Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Stevens:   Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. As our release this morning outlined, operational performance continued at a good pace during the third quarter and we achieved solid financial results, including sales expansion of 6% and continued exceptional cash flow generation. Our focus on operating cash has been the center piece of our strategy that enables sustained investment in the business and sustained returns to shareholders through sharing purchases and increases in our dividend, and I think this strategy is working well as evidence by our ability to increase the quarterly dividend by 19% this quarter, extending our double digit dividend increase 3 consecutive years. Let me start with an update on matters relating to the external environment which we’re operating in, and address some emerging trends. When we last spoke in July, I highlighted what we termed the new reality that we’re facing. Greater security means emerging with fewer resources available to meet them. To address this environment the Defense Department has continued to clarify its objective of implementing major changes in the way equipment services are procured from contractors with a goal to save more than a $100 billion over the next 5 years, from overhead and other accounts without negatively affecting war fighters. Once realized these savings would be invested in new equipment and applied to reserve troop strength, even as military budgets flatten in the future. On September the 14th, under Secretary Defense Acquisition, Dr. Ash Carter, provided additional detail into 23 areas of improvement to make the department’s procurement offices and Defense contractors more efficient. These actions were broadly characterized into 5 majority areas targeting affordability and controlling cost growth instead of [inaudible] productivity and innovation in industry, promoting real competition, improving trade craft in services acquisition and reducing non-productive processes in bureaucracy. Within each of these categories, there are more specific areas of focus, like advancing the use of should cost modeling, eliminating redundant government reporting and review requirements, shortening acquisition cycle times, and increasing the use of fixed price incentive type contracts. Since implementation of these initiatives by the department was planned to be phased in over time, we’ve not yet seen their total effect on our business. And we’ve been advised that some areas will require additional study and be subject to more detail future guidance.  We have however, agreed to be use of a fixed price incentive type contract on our F-35 program in the Lot-4 low rate initial production lot, which I’ll cover later in greater detail. And we certainly welcome the focus on shortening cycle times, as we’re seeing the opposite effect.  Components of the acquisition process have been consuming more time. Some negotiations have taken longer, some awards have been delayed. All having the effect of putting pressure on future growth prospects. So we’re looking forward to working with the department and seeing some tangible results from these streamlining initiatives and we’ll keep you posted as they unfold. Relative to our strategic focus, cost reduction, and efficacy initiatives, we’re making good progress. We’ve entered into an agreement to the rest of enterprise integration group, to Varitop capital for $815 million in cash. While this transaction is subject to government anti-trust review, we expect to close before year end. Our Pacific Architects and engineers unit continues to see solid interest from potential buyers, and we’re on a timeline that supports closure, either late in the fourth quarter of this year, or early in the first quarter next year. These actions, plus the rebalancing of our global logistics and training business, will provide a most crisp focus for our operations. We also previously announced implementation of a voluntary executive separation program, designed to right size the company, reduce layers of management, enhance affordability, tighten reporting relationships, and allow for more direct lines of communication both inside the company and with our customers. This program has been a solid success with approximately 600 employees participating. We will backfill some of these positions but not all of them. And we’ve all ready begun the process of organizational transition of knowledge transfer as we move to a more efficient model. I want to thank those executives who are participating for their valuable contribution, and many years of service to our company and to our customers. Their work has been professional and it’s been highly valued. Our focus on reducing overhead cost, travel expenses, and capital expenditures continues with a renewed emphasis on working with our supply chain. With approximately two thirds of the cost of our products procured from vendors, we must continue to drive down cost and improve quality, delivery, and reliability.  These actions are essential to enable us to deliver the best value to customers and financial performance for shareholders. Turning operational performance, we had a solid quarter with key accomplishments across all business areas. In Aeronautics, I’ll highlight 3 programs where special attention warrant.  On the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we continue to see progress across many areas of the program, but challenges remaining in others.  In the flight test program, the overall tempo of flights continues to ramp up, as evidence by completion of 133 flights this quarter, or almost as many flights in the quarter as the 136 that were completed during the first 6 months this year. This acceleration in the flight test program was planned, and expected. Flight test performance continue to head a plan on both the conventional takeoff and landing, and the carrier variants, while the short take off and the vertical landing of flight completions remain behind schedule. Overall, we’re 26 flights ahead of plan through September, and are tracking toward achievement of the plan 394 flights for the year. Looking at some detail, the CTOL variant is 61 flights ahead of plan and the carrier variant is 5 flights ahead of plan, while the STOVL variant is 40 flights behind plan. STOVL aircraft component reliability continues to be the principle focus area. We’re pursuing a multi-faceted approach to improve tempo that is working to obtain higher levels of spare components and parts from vendors, to keep the aircraft in a flight ready condition while completing the analysis and corrective action planning to address the root cause conditions.  On the software front, we’re about 85% complete with the development of over 15 million lines of code, but much work remains. The software flying now has shown good stability and good functionality, but more resources will be needed to complete software build and test. We’re adding an additional software integration line and additional staff to increase capacity and improve productivity. I thought it might be interesting to give you an example of a day in the life of complex systems development. During routine ground testing of the F-35 fuel management subsystem, a software anomaly was detected. While we never experienced this problem in flight, testing indicated the potential that a fuel boost pump could shut down. Upon detection, flight operations were immediately suspended as a prudent precaution. A corrective modification to the software was immediately undertaken by the fuel systems supplier, and flight testing was resumed limiting the impact to the flight test schedule to about a week. So again, initiated this may not seem like all that much, but from my point of view it’s a model of professionalism in the government industry partnership we’re testing was undertaken with rigor, roles in responsibilities were clear, high standards were maintained and safety was paramount. The process was transparent and effective and resulted in a better airplane without taking on any unnecessary risk. Production activities continue to ramp up at Fort Worth with low rated initial production work yielding good progress on factory cost performance, but with some schedule pressure. Solid cost performance and learning curve data enabled us to reach agreement on price with the government this quarter, on the low rate initial production Lot-4 contract, the 32 aircraft under a fixed price incentive type contract structure. With a 50/50 share line and a 120% sealing, this contract will be challenging and will require focused attention on execution.  We’re working through the normal process to definitize the contract, and once finalized, the Lot-4 contract will bring the total backlog of production aircraft to 63.  International support for the program continues to evolve. We were pleased with Canada’s announcement to acquire the F-35 as their next generation fighter aircraft, as well as the Israeli government signing a letter of offer in acceptance for procurement of the F-35 for their future fighter fleet. The United Kingdom is completing it’s far reaching strategic review. The results of which will be known shortly. In fact, I believe, Prime Minister David Cameron, is presenting the details of the plan now.  Our sense is that the plan will result in the reduction in the number of Joint Strike Fighters to be purchased from below the original planning number which is 138 aircrafts. We also believe they’re are likely to go to the carrier version of the airplane as compared to the original planning which was the short takeoff and vertical landing variant. As they proceed with 2 aircraft carriers, 1 configured with a catapult that supports the carrier variant operations. As I said, the Prime Minister is, I believe releasing some additional details of the plan, now even as we speak. We further sense that both partner and non-partner countries will continue their planning for the F-35. Some may reduce quantities or delay the onset of production in others, may increase and accelerate their buy. And we’ll do all that we can to be flexible and supportive as our customers give all their concepts of operation and their recapitalization needs. In the System Design and Development program, the governments technical baseline review, or TBR continues and is scheduled to be complete next month. While the results of this comprehensive assessment are not yet available, let me give you my overall sense of the progress.  I believe the many independent government assessments of the inherent capabilities of the F-35 system, affirm its fundamental value. Not just in low observability, but in the power of its missions system. Work done to date on the air vehicle support expectations of low signature and sound structural integrity in durability, the propulsion system is performing well and the on board systems are phenomenal. And pilots immediately recognize their strength. The combination of an advanced radar and sensor system along with an integrated communication suite, not only distinguish the F-35 but enhance and enable many other military assets for the F-35 will work with, thereby, improving their value as well. This capability is needed, and valued, and continued investment in the program is warranted.  The TBR then, is specifically focusing on both areas of accomplishment and areas of need. With a negotiation of Lot-4 it appears the cost of the production program are likely to be favorable to prior estimate while the development program will need more resources in software development and flight test. The TBR process is dedicated to developing its solid set of realistic and executable planning assumption, so that the program can be rebase lined as directed in the Nunn-McCurdy process, and that additional resources can be applied. We recognize the long-term confidence in the program must be earned over time by executing and meeting commitments, and the baseline resulting from the TBR process, is an essential foundational requirement. Moving to the C-130 J, we continue to ramp up production levels as customers expand their fleets. The Government of [Iran], recently executed a new contract for 2 airlifters, and on the production line we delivered 7 aircraft and remain on track to a plan delivery of 26 aircraft this year. Robust, domestic, and international demands remain consistent with our planning assumptions. Received by Galaxy, achieved an important milestone in the modernization program with delivery of the first production C-5M aircraft to the air force mobility command. With current plans calling for the modernization of 52 C-5 airlifters by 2016, delivery rates on these modernized aircraft will be ramping up to meet customer requirements. This ramp up was supported by the government’s approval to proceed to full rate production. I’m very proud of our team’s contribution and fielding the modernized C-5M as it provides significantly enhanced capabilities and improved mission readiness for the United States Air Force. With the C-5M providing twice the capability, and costing less than half of other U.S. strategic airlifters, the value to the user community and the tax payer is compelling, and the program aligns well with DoD initiatives on cost savings, efficacy, and affordability improvements. While accomplishments in Aeronautics are many, I was disappointed by the decertification of our EBMS system. We’re committed to the highest standards in process and performance measurement systems. And at Fort Worth, we’ve not maintained these standards. We will correct the deficiencies that have been identified, we know what to do, we know how to do it, and we’re working closely with government subject matter experts on corrective actions. Among other factors, implementation of accurate earned value management system measurement criteria requires stable, fully defined baselines for each program as well as some performance measurement history against which validations can occur. This takes time. For the F-35, we’ll need performance history against the baseline that will be produced by the TBR, a process that will likely take 18 months or so. But when we’re complete, we’ll have a best in class system.  Turning to electronics systems, the team is doing a good job across the portfolio. Two areas merit special recognition this quarter. The Littoral combat ship and missile defense activity. On the Littoral combat ship program, our second vessel at Fort Worth remains on cost and on schedule with more than 60% of the construction completed. Lessons learned from construction of our initial ship that resulted in improved efficacy and a 30% reduction in labor hours on our second ship. We look forward to the Navy’s decision, expected later this quarter to select a single design and the initial award of the Kinship order. Current Navy procurement plans continue to support a 55 ship fleet.  In Ballistic Missile Defense, key progress was achieved with successful completion of the critical design review on the medium extended air defense system. This next generation mobile air and missile defense system will replace currently fielded defense capability. MEADS provides full 360 degree coverage and can defend up to 8 times more area than current systems. Cost efficiencies are also achievable in the MEADS design due to fewer system elements and lower life cycle cost. Moving to Information Systems and Global Solutions, our team, working on the airborne and Maritime Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System, the program known as AMFM Gitters, successfully transferred data and live streaming video over an internet protocol wideband network between multiple air and ground nodes. I know that’s a mouthful but what that means is that this exercise demonstrated the technical maturity of key AMFM Gitters hardware elements in a rotary wing environment and bring secure real-time, interoperable communications to the war fighter, one step closer to reality.  In the area of new contract awards, I was very pleased to see our IS and GS team extend their multi decade relationship in providing information technology support and solutions to the Social Security Administration. Under the $2.8 billion, 7 year IBIQ contract IS&GS will compete for task orders to provide a broad range of IT support. We’ve watched the ongoing transformation at the Administration as they work to support the health and economic well-being of millions of Americans and we’re proud to play a role.  Finally, let me cover two important satellite programs in space systems. The team successfully launched the first advanced extremely high frequency satellite. This is a technologically advanced military communication system that provides highly secure, survivable global communication for war fighters operating on ground, sea, and air platforms. Advanced DHF remains a top priority in DoD, and there’s a potential for future additional satellite awards above the three satellites currently under contract. After launch, the first satellite, experienced a failure of one of its orbit right rising engines. We’re now working on an alternative method of moving into final orbit while still preserving the full planned orbiter life for the satellite. We also completed the critical design review on the global positioning system 3 contract. Completion of this milestone validates the design to insure it meets war fighter and civil requirements, and allows the program to begin the production phase. GPS3 improves navigation, position, and timing services with signals 3 times more accurate and powerful than current GPS systems. Space systems is currently working under a $3 billion contract to build up to 12 satellites for the United States Air Force.  Finally, I’ve described for you, many times, my admiration for our workforce, and the quality of our leadership team. I was very pleased to see Linda Gooden, Marilynn Houston, and Joann Maguire recently named among the 50 most powerful women in business by Fortune Magazine and our general council Mary Ann Lavin recognized by the Washington Post. They are exceptional leaders whose talent and contributions are widely recognized inside and outside of our company. And we are very, very proud of them.  In the near-term we recognize we’re working in a more challenging environment as our customers face more volatility that will likely pressure our revenue growth, and as we face pension headwind that will likely increase pressure on earnings. I have unshakable confidence in our future however, because of the quality of our portfolio and the quality of our people, and our collective willingness to do all that is necessary to affectively navigate this new reality.  Let me turn the call over to Bruce now to provide some additional detail on the third quarter financial results, and some initial color on emerging trends and there potential impact on 2011 financials, and then Bruce and I will come back and take your questions, Bruce.
Bruce Tanner:   Thanks Bob. We posted charts on our website to help with our discussion today, and at this time I’d encourage you to open the charts and follow along with me as I make my comments. Let’s begin with chart 3, a summary of significant of portfolio shaping and affordability actions we took this quarter. First we’re pleased with the value we’ll receive with the announced sale of our EIG business for $815 million. And as a reminder, with announced sale, the operating results for EIG have been classified as discontinued operations.  As a result, we’ve lowered our 2010 sales and segment profit outlook by the amounts we expect EIG to contribute. Other than this movement to discontinue operations, our guidance remains unchanged for the year.  And finally, we do anticipate that this sale will close by year end. As for PAE, as Bob said, we will expect to close that transaction later this year or early in 2011. And moving down the same chart, to our voluntary executive separation program we have about 600 employees participating in the program and I’m sure you saw our AK announcing the $178 billion pretax charge for the program. Over the next few weeks or months, we’ll be working with our customer to agree on the timing of recovery of the program cost in the amount of recurring savings that will generate going forward. We would expect to recover majority of the program cost in the future as we price new business.  You can now turn to chart 4 in our third quarter sales summary. Overall the corporation grew 6% in the quarter. Electronic Systems had the strongest growth at 10%, due primarily to the third quarter deliveries of our Persistent Threat Detection System or PTDS in the quarter. This contract began earlier this year and all deliveries occurred in this quarter. Both Aeronautics and IS&GS grew at 7% in the quarter with a growth in Aeronautics driven by the F-35 program and C-130 deliveries. Growth at IS&GS was driven by the 2010 census program and our efforts at the Doe [inaudible] site. Space Systems' sales were 5% lower than last year due to the absence of the commercial satellite sale; we had none this quarter versus 1 in the third quarter of last year. Chart 5 shows our revised sales guidance with EIG and discontinued operations. Again, the only change was removing the sales for EIG from the IS&GS projections. Looking at the end of the year for each of the business areas, I would expect Electronic Systems and IS&GS to be at the high-end of their ranges. Space Systems' to be at the low end of its range, and Aeronautics to likely be in the middle of its range.  Chart 6 shows the same guidance changes for segment profit. Again, looking at where we expect to end the year, I’d expect Electronic Systems, Space Systems, and Aeronautics to be at the high end of their ranges while IS&GS will be towards the lower end of its range. Moving to chart 7 and our cash flow performance, again this quarter cash was very strong as we generated over $500 million in cash while contributing over $1 billion to our pension plans. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations while contributing $1.4 billion to our pension plans. Without this contribution our operating cash through the first three quarters would have been $4.8 billion or more than $1 billion more than last year through the same period.  Looking forward to the rest of the year, we were able to keep our guidance at $3.4 billion of operating cash while planning for an additional 800 million of pension contributions in the fourth quarter bringing our full year of contribution level to $2.2 billion.  Turning to chart 8 we’ll look at our dividends and yield increases over the last 5 years. With a 19% increase in dividends, we announced in the quarter our yield at the current share price is just under 4% and if you annualize the dividend increase, the yield exceeds 4%. Combined with our share repurchases, we returned 76% of our year-to-date pre-cash flow to shareholders. We’ll speak to our share repurchase activity on the next chart, chart 9. Year-to-date we’ve repurchased almost 20 million shares for just under $1.6 billion. That brings our current shares outstanding to less than 360 million. A 4.1% decrease since the beginning of the year.  On our next chart, chart 10, we’ll show our continuing earnings per share outlook compared with last quarter’s outlook. In June we provided guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share. Of course in this quarter we had the $178 billion charge for our vest which impacted the outlook for the year by $0.31 per share. And moving the results of EIG into discontinued operations lowered our continuing earnings per share by an additional $0.11 per share.  A number of other items committed to an overall two-set increase resulting in our new EPS guidance of $6.75 to $6.95 per share. Finally, I’d like to give you a brief update on what we see as emerging trends as we head into 2011. We still plan to provide our detailed guidance in January but wanted you to have an idea of the trends we’re seeing as we sit here today. For the top line we expect our sales for continuing operations next year to grow at low single digit growth rate over this year. Aeronautics will have another year of strong growth driven by the F-35 program and C-130 deliveries. Electronic Systems will be flattish compared with this year, losing the benefits of the PTDS sales we have this year in addition to delays and expected rewards for the littoral combat ship, and additional bad production. IS&GS will likely have a slight decrease as we finish the 2010 census this year, and lose that activity in 2011.  In addition, we’re expecting the Federal IT market to shrink from 2 to 3% IN 2011 compared with 2010. Between the PTDS and census program, we had nearly $1 billion in 2010 sales that will not be replicated in 2011. Space Systems will also remain relatively flat compared with 2010 as we’ve been saying for some time now. We expect segment profit to be similar to the 2010 level will result in lower [Ross] compared with 2010. And as we look at our pension expense on a FASB CAS basis, our asset returns this far are favorable compared with our long-term assumption of 8 ½% return while the rates used to determine our discount rate have declined significantly throughout the year. In addition, we are now assuming that CAS harmonization will be effective in 2012 rather than in 2011. The combination of each of these items leads us to believe that the FASB CAS drag on our EPS will grow considerably in 2011. With that, I think we’re ready for your questions. Jevon, if you’d please open up the lines.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. 
Richard Safran – Buckingham Research Group, Inc. :  Hi. Good morning. 
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Rich. 
Richard Safran – Buckingham Research Group, Inc. : I wanted to ask you first, some metal supplies have been talking about the increasing demand and they’re raising prices for some strategic metals and specifically I’ve been noticing it for stainless titanium alloys and nickel alloys. I was wondering if you could comment on how this would impact your cost near and long term. And also in your comments if you would, would you talk about any compactly constraints you might be seeing? 
Bruce Tanner:  Rich, like me take a shot at it and then I’ll see if Bob has anything to offer after I finish. It may surprise some folks but in all honesty, we don’t buy a lot of the commodities and the metals and so forth that we use to build our products. As it turns out, we tend to aggregate the demands for that – for those products and commodities and instead we let a lot of our suppliers use those aggregated demands to purchase those materials.  And so what we tended to do in the past is establish some fairly long-term purchase agreements that provide us stability in both the supply as well as the pricing. But think of that ability to aggregate the overall supply amongst a lot of different suppliers in our bases bring us the best prices.  And I’ll tell you, relative to the specifics you cited, I’m not aware of any issues with our ability to acquire or price fluctuation or that it’s out of the ordinary of what we’re seeing today. 
Bob Stevens: And Rich, let me expand just a bit on Bruce’s comment. However, notionally we’ve had discussions with the Department of Defense Acquisition Team as we’ve extended these conversation about affordability initiatives in thinking through the prospect of increasing material prices and the greater need for us to act like a strategic buyer. And that’s why this notion of long-term contract, long-term predictability, multi-year procurements have been advanced by – I think the industry community broadly because that will allow us to get the best possible prices really in any set of market conditions, even if there were to be some upward price pressure.  Also, you asked the question about capacity constraints here. We planned our program in a flexible way so we’re not experiencing any capacity shortfalls today at all. And on our major program, take a C-130 as an example, we’ve been able to go from 16 to 26 to approximately 36 based on optimizing the investment that we’ve made. To date, we’d be able to do the same thing on the Joint Strike Fighter. We think our Littoral Combat Ship offering has been thought through in a similar set of circumstances.  So we try to balance our view about the capacity in assuring that we have gated investments. We call them gated, or we want to get a greater knowledge before we make entirely speculative investments about what the future horizon will look like. We try to build as much flexibility in the capacity that we have. And we also have thought through the prospect of potentially building down. If there were more headwind, can we build down and still not lose the bubble on affordability or profitability. The F-16 line is probably a good historical example of the ability to scale up as global circumstances change and customers – recapitalize needs vary and then to build down and build back up. So the lessons that we’ve learned there we try to populate throughout the company. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gersky with Citi Investments. 
Jason Gersky – Citi Investments:  Hey. Good morning, everyone. I was just wondering if you could offer a little bit more detail on the Allred Four Contract. Particularly maybe some commentary about the longer-term margin profile and how you envision revenues and margins ramping over the next several years taking into consideration this contract; just particularly relative to the way you’ve talked about the program in the past. 
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, Jason, I’ll jump in here. And Bob gave me some other relatives and is prepared a march relative to the contract structure that we agreed to. I would characterize it as still enabling us to have the kind of margin expansion on the product program that I’ve been talking about in the past. I think in past calls I’ve talked about the thought that we’d like it to be able to achieve about a 10 percent Ross about the time we hit the middle of this decade or when we hit full – full-rate production profile in our product contracts. And I still think that’s the case. I still think this contract enabled us to do that. We wouldn’t have agreed to it if we didn’t think we could execute to it.  It’s probably a little tighter in terms of the risks elements of it on the Share Line and the sealing that I would have otherwise liked. But I think that puts a little bit of a premium on us to focus on our execution, but I think we’re capable of doing that. 
Bob Stevens: And Jason, on the other side, a significant and important element when we move from costs reimbursable to fixed-price environments is assuring we’ve got a known configuration that the requirements are stable. So there’s additional discipline in the process and that’s not just on our side, it’s on the government side.  And not withstanding Lot-4, but let me give you just a sense about this movement from cost-type, to fixed-price type contract. There’s less flexibility overall in a fixed-price type of contract and that requires some behavioral changes. You know, I’ll make up an overly simplified illustration. It doesn’t really have much to do with Lot-4, but in a cost-reimbursable environment, if we agree that we are going to meet every quarter and the government would say we’d rather meet monthly, our first response is where, and when and what subject matters experts should we bring.  Under a fixed-price contract, we will say we’re going to need to submit a change order to you to change the contract budge baseline to now include provision for the costs of meeting monthly. That’s a behavioral difference.  So I think we’re all trying to go into this environment with our eyes open. As Bruce said, the wristband gets a little tighter on our side; the discipline, I think, gets cranked up on both sides. We lose a little flexibility but we think the advantages of taking on modestly more risk or diminishing flexibility will be worn out by improved performance on the program and that’s what we’re all focused on. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned, Stanford Bernstein. 
Doug Harned – Stanford Bernstein:  Yes, good morning. In the release and your discussion on 2011 earnings, there’s a sentence that says that you’re seeing – the industry is seeing delays and cancellations in programs and it also – adjacent markets are turning out to be less mature than anticipated. I wonder if you could talk about this a little bit. In particular, if you look at where the overall budget is right now and you look at the 2011 budget, it’s actually a pretty strong budget. So think about that in terms of a lot of delays and cancellations. I’m trying to understand how you fit that together.  And then on the adjacent side, what are the adjacent markets that you are seeing as more difficult right now? 
Bruce Tanner: Doug, let me start the conversation and then I’ll turn it over to Bob. You know, last year about this time we provided you guidance, not just for the year 2010 expectations, we tried to get a little longer-term view of what we’re expecting to see and I think during that call I talked about sales in 2011 as kind of being at the mid-single-digit level. We’re now – we’re now talking about more like the low-single-digit level. And in the items that you mentioned from the press release, the reasons for that diminished outlook – I’ll give you a couple of examples maybe to highlight each of what you’re talking about there.  One on the delays, think of hurdles like the Littoral Combat Ship, which we are assuming in our numbers of 2011 as a win when we talk about the growth rate we’re seeing over 2010. But we had expected when we were talking last year for that award to have been sometime in early summer of this year. We’re now talking about a November award potentially. So think of that being, you know, almost six months of delay there. It doesn’t change obviously the overall expectations of sales for the Littoral Combat Ship, but it does – it does change the phasing. So we’re going to shift some of those sales to the right and push some of the early ramp rate in 2011 over into 2012.  The same exact thing is happening with the FAD, production loss. We’d expect to get those earlier in the year. It looks like they’ll be later in the year and it’s the same kind of delayed ramp up in the higher FAD production that we’re seeing there.  On the cancellation side, the best example I think I can give to you there is we do a contract for IS&GS called the FDI Sentinel Project which is really a case-management study or a case-management program where we were doing development to enable a lot greater capability of that system. And I think in a large part due to the budget pressures within the Federal budget, but the decision was made to stop doing further production on that activity and instead essentially do with what you’ve got and go more into an operations and maintenance phase going forward as opposed to a development phase.  So not so much a cancellation as a scope reduction. In fact, reflecting I think the reality we’re talking about.  And then on the adjacent market scenario, really we’re talking about there’s the energy market, and specifically there’s the concentrated solar power market. We had talked to you last year at this time. We had in play a potential deal we were looking at providing for Arizona Power Municipality. As it turned out, it didn’t happen for a number of reasons, but we also thought there were a number of smaller arrangements around the country that were going to materialize. And as we sit here today, again I think because – and frankly because of some of the fiscal pressures we’re seeing and the tax revenues going down, I think we’re seeing a delay in those particular types of projects. And Bob, I’m [inaudible]. 
Bob Stevens:  Yeah. I would tell you that obviously we only speak for ourselves, but I’m going to guess we’re not the only one speaking to the predominant of the [inaudible] as described to you. Even as early as April of 2009 when Secretary Gates had a number of program decisions and announcements, some of which impacted our company and some in which impacted others, we began to communicate to you and others our sense and the praise we viewed in this new reality. And big part of that new reality was the fiscal challenges that our nation’s facing and the need to adapt, just some fiscal discipline.  As a result, you know, we’re seeing the – I think some building of the pressure on that horizon. Bruce gave you some illustrations about delays and cancellations. As we watch the Bills work their way through the congress, I think there was a level of interest that drew our attention in the Senate Appropriations Committee mark because they talked about the number of programs. I even think that if I get the math right, I think the number’s 41 programs they may have described as being delayed in some fashion. The result of which was they’re withholding some funding to see if those delays were going to be recovered or whether they were going to be persistent. So I think there’s a broader observation of the process slowing down a little and that’s why among the affordability initiatives that Dr. Carter [released], we are keenly interested in adding our full prodded voice and any experience we have in our energy and focusing on shortening the cycle time. Not only because it will help remedy the discussion that Bruce just had with you now about the onset of revenue recognition, but we pulled out all the way through to floor structure and military capability, that can be fielded. And we don’t want to see that process delayed either because the real value of the systems we work on, if you think of returns on their value commences when they get fielded and put into operational services.  So we – I think we have joined objectives and initiatives with the administration in getting this right. But our job here is to make sure that we’re as clear and transparent and can give you the best of our professional judgement as we look out over pretty complicated landscape and give you a feel that we have a future.  I’ll also say we’ve not hesitated in taking actions here that would be consistent with our appraisal of this future. Even as far back as 2009, we began consolidations where our program baselines would be changed. We’ve gone through some pretty painful reductions in force and that’s something we work hard to avoid, but we can’t avoid the reality of sizing the workforce to the volume of work that we have to accomplish with the government. We – we’ve elected some of the vestures here that we’ve described to you fully to help us focus and really meet new sets of expectations in the markets that we serve. But also to help us get a greater operational focus.  We talked about the voluntary separation program. We’ve been scrubbing our expense budgets and our capital budgets and really focusing on generating operational cash, which we think is a very important focus area as we adapt to the new reality which we are committed to adapting to, and running this business well. We think it’s very sound judgement on our part to focus on cash so that we can certainly weather any financial challenges we have, but also very much prepare for what we believe will be a re-establishment of the growth trajectory for the business in the future as we go through these early rounds of budget examination to see what new baselines will look like.  I like the priorities our programs enjoy. I like the support that we’ve had in the President’s budget with the administration. I like the support that we’ve had in Congress overall. As a statement about the portfolio, I think we align well with the military and intelligence community needs and some markets will probably accelerate and some will have a little pressure and we’ll do our best to have sound judgement here as we allocate resources and do not over invest in emerging or adjacent market areas so that we have difficulties in returning value on those investments and we’ll stay very focused and we’ll do our best to keep you advised in advance of our experience in these challenges. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JP Morgan Securities. 
Joseph Nadol – JP Morgan Chase & Co. : Hi. Good morning, guys. My question is on cash deployment. You had very strong cash flow in the quarter and you effectively upped your guidance pretty significantly for the year ex-pension. But you made some significant changes with regards to deployments. Big extra deployment into the pension fund, raised the dividend very significantly and you cut back pretty significantly on share purchase. Since there’s a zero-sum gain, I was wondering if you could offer us some insight into how you’re thinking about those three buckets relative to each other going forward.  Also, any – if you can shed me a light on what the net proceeds from EIG should be and how you’re going to use those proceeds. 
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Joe. I’ll tackle this one. You asked about pension, dividend, share repos and the actions we took in the quarter and what that means for the future. I’ll start off with pension just to begin with because that’s a big moving piece of the whole discussion. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are now assuming that cash harmonization is effective in 2012 versus 2011. That actually has the effect of lowing the CAS number in 2011 from what we expected. That’s one of the contributors to the additional FASB CAS GAAP relative to ETS that I talked about earlier.  The discount rates have – are significantly lower and I don’t think that’s a great surprise to anyone. They’re lower now than they were at the end of the last year. And we still need to see how much change we’re going to see between now and the year end.  Relative to the $2.2 billion, you know, we might give a little bit of tutorial relative to the risk of funding requirements for pension plans. The ERISA, which obviously is the law that governs our pension plans in general, basically treats the discount rate and difference and either our FAS evaluation or our CAS in that discount rate for ERISA is for all intents and purposes, kind of set now going into next year. So think of it as a 24-month moving average. So we kind of know what that is now and with the contributions to get us to the 2.2 and where we expect our asset returns to be by the end of the year, we think that this additional contribution amount will get us to the 80 percent funded level at the start of 2011 relative to an ERISA measurement perspective, which gets us in line with the expectation of the PPA, the Pension Protection Act that becomes effective for us in 2011.  And in that scenario, unless there are future changes beyond in 2011 in the form of lower discount rates or obviously lower asset returns, we would not expect to have to make additional discretionary contributions into the fund as we’ve done for the last few years. In essence, the baseline – I’ll call them the baseline ERISA requirements for contributions will be what it takes to keep the fund funded. Not just the 80 percent to actually grow that number over time. So a lot of what we’ve talked about recently in terms of discretionary contributions, we would not expect to have to make anywhere near that level going forward.  On the dividend, we took a look at where we sat from the dividend perspective and our growth prospects and we just felt that – and I should say we talked to an awful lot of investors as well who felt that in today’s environment, a strong cash generating company with a strong dividend yield was looked upon favorably. And so we did that consciously under that assumption.  And then on the share repurchases, we probably were a little bit lighter in the quarter here this year. We still expect to continue, although we’ve, you know, as compared to the first three quarters of last year actually were up compared to where we were last year. I think some of that was just the phasing what we did in the first half of the year. I don’t see that changing, Joe, as we go forward because we still, you know, the 50 percent of free cash flow going forward that we’ve done for quite some times is still our plan.  And I think your last question concerned the EIG net receipt that we expect to get from that. And we would expect to net out about a ½ billion dollars, thinking that relatively EIG sale. And we would continue to use them in our – I’ll just characterize it as our general purpose use of cash for all the sorts of three things that we talked about earlier. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank AG. 
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank AG: Thanks. I did have a quick question I think on this C130J and looking at the air mobility commentary in the discussion. It was one of the first times of seeing their mobility even come down on a year-on-year basis and also given how many more you delivered in the quarter year-on-year. I’m just not sure how to read that. Can you help me with that one? 
Bruce Tanner: Yeah, Myles, this is Bruce again. I’m sorry, one of the reasons for that, the year-over-year change was we’re kind of getting towards the tail end of the original multi-year contract and as we typically get towards the tail end of contracts we do have more profit adjustments recognizing the performance on that contract. That’s exactly what we’ve experience in this scenario last year.  So we had more inflection-to-date pickups. As we start into kind of the new contracts post-multiyear, with the volume coming there, as you point out, there are higher numbers of aircraft. So we’ve not yet had the kind of experience on these contracts early on to have – to warrant the sort of inflection to date adjustments as we did with the prior multi-year contract.
Myles Walton – Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And how much of a headwind is that on a run-rate margin basis? 
Bruce Tanner: Well again, it’s going to be quarter to quarter dependent because we didn’t have those sorts of inceptions-to-date step ups ever quarter last year. You know, as I look going forward in 2011, I wouldn’t expect to have a significantly, you know, you call it a headwind going forward for C-130, I wouldn’t expect to see that from 2010 to 11.  So that’s kind of thinking of it as the run rate we’re doing now is about the run rate we’re going to expect to have in 2011.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. 
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: Hi. Good morning. Question on the margins. I guess it looks optically like if you were calling for modest revenue growth in ’11 but segment operating income flat, that that would imply margin pressure in the business. Is that right and where are you seeing it and why? 
Bruce Tanner: That’s actually what I tried to see in the prepared remarks, exactly as you just said, Noah and you know when, again, I’ll harken back to when we spoke a year ago this time and I did give longer-term guidance for both 2011 and 2012 at that time. I thought at that time that we were trending more towards going into margins in the, you know, 10, 10 ½, upper-10 range and I still think even though sales have come down a little bit, with the portfolio changes we’re seeing, the higher F-35 sales stroke, you know, just as an example, I’m still seeing next year the F-35 market is going to grow some 20 percent above the level it is in 2010 for instance. So it is bringing with it lower margins over all and with that kind of portfolio shift, I do expect the margins to come down somewhat from where we are today, down into the tens probably in 2011. 
Noah Poponak – Goldman Sachs: When you think about the margin longer term, you know, we hear a pretty concerned effort out of the Pentagon to transfer more risk to the contractor and make it more about performance and not up-front contracting. How concerned are you internally that that pressures defense contractor margins? 
Bob Stevens: This is Bob Stevens. You know that, the answer to that is it all depends, but right now we’re not concerned. What we – if you look historically, we’ve had a good number of fixed-price type contracts where we execute very well. So the discussion in my mind is not whether or not risk is transferred or the contract type is cost reimbursable, fixed prices. What are the underlying conditions in behaviors that align with the contract type? There is no magic in a contract type. The magic is in alignment and that’s not just from our point of view, that’s the government’s point of view.  So as a matter of professional discipline on our part, we’re going to continue to advance discussions that say, if we want to undertake a different kind of contracting architecture here, let’s also undertake all the responsibilities that are necessary to align the conditions that make that contracting methodology successful for you, the government and us the industry. And so far, I believe we’ve been able to do that and I tried to highlight a little of Lot-4 F35. There will be some behavioral changes and there’ll be some discipline, and there will be some reduction in flexibility. We won’t jigger around the configuration, we’ll be – we’ll have a tighter bandwidth on performance all around. And I believe the government is up for that and we are certainly up for that and we know how to do this. We have the breadth and depth of our portfolio has been such that we’ve got lots of experience across the company and what we’re working on now is to make sure that we’re populating that experience across the company so that perhaps if there are organizations who in the recent past have not had familiarity with fixed price incentive type contracts, they’re becoming a lot smarter about fixed-priced contracting environments today as we think out government customers would want us to be so that we don’t fail to meet the execution responsibilities and commitments that we make.  So I mean, it is a concerted focus here. We’re not overly concerned about it. We can believe we have defined financial returns and generate value there as we have to deliver commitments under contracts to government customers. 
Jerry Kircher: Jevon, this is Jerry. Because we’ve got a bunch of people in the queue still, if we could extend the call to 12:15, let’s continue on and work through the open queue. 
Operator: No problem Sir. And our next question comes from George Shapiro with Access 342.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Yeah, Bob. I was wondering if you could provide for that F-35 contract the target price and the target margin and also how that relates to either what’s your experiencing now on [L-rip3] or the implied learning curve that you’re expecting to get just so we can make some judgment on how achievable this might be given the tighter ranges that you talked about on sealing. 
Bob Stevens: Yes, George, I’m not going to give you the target price and I’m not going to give you the target profitability or the margins. And I’m sure you’ll do a good job at making estimates about our performance of the absence of that data. I will tell you we have about a 74% learning curve expectation on production. We’re about walking down that curve. And of course there’s lots of negotiations and even in the back of my mind George, some competitive landscape of the F-35 as you look broadly around the globe, we think there’s going to be strong international interest and I’m really not leaning forward in giving very specific pricing and other information about it. That’s the only reason I don’t want to offer it at this time. But I will tell you, as we look at the transition from the FDD program into production, if we look at the movement of cost, if we look at the likely returns, the cost reimbursable environment through the transition production and the transition fixed price contracting, I tell you, this is in line with historic standards, save for maybe two observations that we did share with you and others, a 50/50 share line in Lot-4 is a little more aggressive and 120% sealing is a little tighter, but then we believed we had a constructive and valuable discussion about the content of the program, the configuration of the aircraft, what’s expected to be delivered. And those are the areas that tend to put pressure on cost. When you don’t have as thorough an understanding about content or what is exactly deliverable – we’ve tried to take that on earlier with full cooperation from our customer because our customer wanted us to step up and embrace some of this fixed-price incentive contract modeling. So it isn’t again, that we say no, we can’t do that – our viewpoint honestly is we can do a lot of things provided that conditions are consistent to warrant the contracting methodology and the architecture in the contract. 
Bruce Tanner: George, I’ll offer up on other maybe observation for you. First off, if I go back to my early days when I started my career in Fort Worth working the F-16 program, every single F-16 contract in production was an FDI contract. So we’ve had this experience now for, in my case, almost 30 years.  And as I look at the F-35 in particular, you know, not to directly answer your question relative to target price and margins and so forth, but I found one of the interesting things as I looked at it is you take a look at the cost, the target cost on the L-rip 1 aircraft, so that was for two aircraft and compare that with the target cost of L rip-4, the cost of the L rip-4 aircraft are about half as much as the cost of the L-rip 1 aircrafts. So think of that in 31 aircrafts down the product line, we’ve lowered the cost amount on those aircraft by half and the other aspect as I look at from the risk perspective Bob described as far as working this contract is, you know, I very much view the L-rip 4 contract is the risk we’re taking on is continued, I’ll say performance down the learning curve.  I think we have a good understanding between ourselves and the government relative to concurrency risk with new findings in the SDD contract, the development contract such that that will not sort of bleed over onto the L-rip 4 contract. And it’s because of that, that I ultimately felt comfortable signing the – or getting the agreements with the contract with the terms that we have. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Gleacher & Company
Peter Arment – Gleacher & Company: Good afternoon Bob. Bob, could you just give us maybe some more color on this U.K. F-35 decision to swap out of still offering conventional? I realize it’s kind of real time but sounds like you’ve been briefed a little bit. Maybe one of the puts and takes of the way we should think about this on the program for the long-term. And then if you could also just tie it in with your views of the international, in general, for the entire corporation. I mean, you’ve seen real cuts in the U.K. by 8% in Germany, and I think expectations are there’s further pressure here in the U.S. How should we think about the international market place, thanks?
Bob Stevens:  Yeah, I’ll take it in sections, Peter. Actually, I think we probably know about as much of the U.K. decision on F-35 as you do. I mean, you have to sort of filter out the things that are being described and discussed as the process is unfolding from the actual results of the process. It’s a very comprehensive review that’s been undertaking in the United Kingdom, it’s very broad. It’s very deep. It’s very forward looking.  I don’t even think the exact numbers of airplanes to be procured, have been determined as I’m sure - which is typical of all national security planners that we deal with in our international and domestic community. We try to work through concepts of operations likely future scenarios, how much equipment will need to be capable, on what date to accomplish what task. So I believe we’re watching the results flow out of the U.K. sort of in process. Where some determinations have been made, I think the judgment to move away from Stovall to the carrier variant. And I’m going to make some guesses here Peter, but that that decision might be made to enhance interoperability, to enable potentially U.S. aircraft to land on U.K. aircraft carriers, where French aircraft, or vice versa. So I think that the experience we’ve had has been judgments are made on capability, total expense, lifecycle cost, interoperability, flexibility. And that’s what we’re seeing in the U.K. And we’ll have to see what ultimate judgments are made about airplanes. But just stick with the F-35 for awhile.  We’ve long expected that there would be substantial movement over time. In the total estimated volumes of airplanes to be procured, whether they’re U.S. airplanes for the Air Force, the Navy, or the Marine Corps or whether they’re for are international partners. The model we’ve offered before, the one that we think is the most relevant to the situation we face today on the F-35 is the F-16, started at little more than 900 airplanes grew into 4400 airplanes. In 26 countries we’re still seeing follow on orders from those countries to back build support, extend their fleet.  I very much believe that will be the case of, for the F-35. And I know, governments now are facing tough economic conditions. But they’re also facing very tough security environments. I do believe this airplane has already demonstrated the fundamental capabilities that cause individuals to recognize its enormous value. So I rather suspect, we’ll see it in the case of the U.K., reduction in the quantity, but we’ll also see cases like Israel who was not an investing partner in the core program, who’s come forward in the queue. They’ve talked about 75 airplanes in total, they’d like to get the first [inaudible], I think 18 to 20, or whatever that number will be sooner.  I believe other governments and countries in the Middle East, in the Asia Pacific theater are also recognizing very significant security challenges. I think some of those countries are feeling less pressured in their fiscal environments. They might have more resources, and may look at the current circumstances with regard to the U.K. or maybe other countries who are lessening the buyer, delaying the buys as a opportunity to get in the queue, and to buy airplanes. Our focus here has to be on execution. And we’re not going to allow ourselves to be distracted. We’re certainly not overly concerned or hyperventilating. I suspect they’ll be some EBB and Flow in quantities and timing, and even aircraft types. But we’ve got a very capable program foundation here. We talk a lot about the Stovall because it deserves to have the conversation since its 40 flights behind its schedule and we’re having some component failures. The time we spend there causes us to talk less about the CTOL and the CV version that are really flying very well. And I assure you that the United States Navy and the United States Air Force are very excited about the prospects of performance of this program, and recognize the contributions we can make by delivering this capability as do our international partner.  So I’ll tell you again, get a seat with a seat belt on it, because this is not the first discussion we’re going to have with international partners about quantities or aircraft types or timing. There will be more. Our goal is to stay close to those customers, support them in every possible way we can, and give them very realistic appraisals about our performance and what they should expect. Not just on cost and pricing, and availability, but aircraft capability.  Extending the discussion beyond the F-35, when we look at the international market place, we still see growth opportunities for our business. Our portfolio is well populated with the kinds of capabilities that governments place a high priority on. Like missile defense. I know we can’t get talk definitively about the littoral combat ship, but I really believe deeply in that mission, and deeply in the concept of a ship of this class in the littorals. And I’m confident other international governments do as well. So there would be international opportunities there, for the C-130. We believe they’re strong interest. We’re not done delivering F-16s yet, and have significant campaigns under way that you know, support the evolution of F-35 quantities.  So our sense is, we’re living in a world that has a lot of security challenges, notwithstanding the economic pressures. What’s really going to matter is, do you have a mature portfolio, have you demonstrated that the systems that your working on, actually work when they’re placed into service they do. And can you deliver according to the commitments that are under the contract. Those are the fundamental details we focus on without allowing ourselves to be distracted. So I don’t see a dramatic [inaudible] or change in the expectations for international growth. We’re committed to staying on that pattern. We’ll redouble some efforts in our international support community. We’ll flow resources, talent people, executive presence there, and then we’ll work with the U.S. government here as we develop the budget for 2012, figure out what will happen through the continuing resolution, and the potential laying duck session for the 2011 funding, and keep you advised.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Cal Von Rumohr, from Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr – Cowen and Company:  Yes, thank you very much. So your pension guidance for 2011 of a billion, is 550 million higher than what you gave us at midyear, despite the fact that you’re putting 800 million more into the pension from despite the fact that you’re now in positive territory in terms of returns. And based on kind of what you told us, the discount rate was about 100 million per 25 bids, you know, that’s probably some 350 million negative. So by my numbers, you’re 200 million off. How much of that is CAS/harmonization and if you could walk us through the other items. And then give us some rough color as to what should we expect in 2012, because you gave us some color on that the last time. Thanks. 
Jerry Kircher:  You’re numbers are all very directionally accurate. Think of the discount rate change, and by the way, I’m not here to suggest that the discount rate is 5% today. We tried to give you some sensitivity in the press release. We picked that number thinking if things continue down the path from the interest rate perspective, that’s where it could be. I don’t think we’re there today, by the way.  But sticking to that number, if you assume the 5%, that’s about 400 million of the 550 or so that you’re talking about. And then the CAS/harmonization, from what we considered last year to now, moving that out from 2011 to 2012 that accounts for the full difference. Think of that as being about 150 million bucks next year. In 2012, I’ll be honest with you, I hate to even speculate on 2012, given that we – I don’t know where we’re going to end up in 2010. I’d just as soon wait until we see what that looks like, and perhaps I’ll give you some more color on that in the January call.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Troy Lahr, from Stifel Nicolaus. 
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus & Co, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Bob, I’m wondering if you can maybe talk about how you’re managing the loss of knowledge at the executive level. I guess, it sounded like maybe 3 times more people took the offer. Are the 600 people leaving, kind of a different phases, and maybe can you talk about how that’s spilt between your four segments?
Bob Stevens:  Yeah, I’m happy to. A editorial note, at least from my point of view, I’ve heard some discussion about what was expected versus what was happened. What happened was what I expected, so. And I won’t comment more about that, I just find it interesting. So more than 70% of those who have accepted the voluntary executive separation program are retirement eligible, which means they could walk out the door today. And I’ll be very candid in my selection of language with you. It isn’t as though the actions that we’ve taken or that I’ve authorized here are taking us off a cliff. These folks were going to leave in the next couple of years anyway. And the question in our mind was, how do you want to orchestrate the environment in which seasoned senior folks are going to leave. And we elected to take ourselves to a position, rather than allow circumstances to envelope us and take us in a place that we have not planned for – or couldn’t adequately predict what the outcome would be.  So years ago, we began planning through a series of executive rotations. Perhaps you’re familiar with the phrase full spectrum leadership, the investment in a center for leadership excellence here to begin to populate a set of experience to rotation of assignments, and broadening experiences in this company. A cadre of talent, it was not retirement eligible today, recognizing we’ve got a demographic ship not just in our company and our industry, but throughout our government where the baby boomers are going to go to retirement. And they’re going to go no matter what you and I do.  So the best program was part of a much broader articulated strategy of how to transition through generational change in our company without losing the bubble on execution or programs. So we began to link executives through mentoring program and through experiential relationships so that we would grow the population underneath the senior leaders who were about to depart. And you added an important component here, the phasing of executive responsibility. So let’s do some math; 600 or so people will leave between now and February. Our sense was that they would be leaving in the relatively near-term anyway.  We begun early phasing in a variety of ways where it makes sense to do that. We won’t back fill, so entire compliment of 600 executives because a principle goal for us is to get leaner, more streamline, to right size this business, but we will back fill while we consolidate and realign our organizational focus. We think that makes us stronger, not weaker. And we’ll have people who will be placed into these realigned executive responsibilities, who have had experience, who do have contact with those who will be departing. In some cases, under the direct tutelage of those who will be leaving, and I will say this about the professional work force that we have, including our retires today and our soon to become retirees who are in the Vest program. They care deeply about the mission. They care deeply about this company, and there is not one who would fail to help a colleague even after they were to depart in February. So I think we’re very well aligned to face the reality that we’re all facing. And others I guess, will go about this at a approach that they think makes sense. This approach in our judgment was exactly the way we ought to navigate in this new reality, knowing we’re going to face the challenge that we’re facing.  So I think we’re very well positioned here. I don’t expect a single blimp on a program, I don’t expect any difficulty. We have plenty of phasing in time, which we are doing now. And we’ll continue to stay very focused on this. It’s not just going to be through February, but when new people go to new assignments at any time, under any set of conditions, we try to give them more rather than less help to make sure we’re all getting grounded and our expectations are clear and communications are crisp. And we’re prepared to do that, and have means and mechanisms in place now to help facilitate that.  So I’m pleased you asked the question because I think we haven’t talked a lot about beyond the numbers, what do you expect in an operating environment from the company as you move forward, and your question gave us an opportunity to highlight that a bit.
Jerry Kircher:  Jevon, I think we have time for one more call if we could please.
Operator:  Okay, our final question comes from George Shapiro, with Access 342.
George Shapiro – Access 342: Yeah, Bob. I had one other question just in general here. That with the – you sold EIG for 12 times EBIT, your own stock selling for 5 times. We’ve seen other transactions in the 10 to 12 times. I mean, why wouldn’t this get you to want to take a sharp look at some of the other businesses that you have, and potentially take a look at them for sale if the valuations between the public and private markets don’t close? 
Bob Stevens:  Well, there’s several observations I’d offer you there, George. But first, and I hope we conveyed this with clarity when we talked to you about EIG and PAD we do, routinely look at every aspect of this business, strategically, operationally, and financially relative to a short-term, intermediate term, and long-term fit with regards to delivering value to customers and value to shareholders while we create a vibrant environment here for our employees. If we trigger a threshold and any one of those domains, as was the case with EIG on the organizational conflict of interest or PAD where gross opportunities were progressively misaligned with our core strategy, we won’t hesitate. I will also tell you, we’re not pleased with trading multiple of our stock, and damn well believe we can do better. So in the short horizon I don’t think we’re going to be looking at wholesales divestiture here before we look at operating the businesses better, navigating through some near-term turbulence, recognizing the quality and strength of our portfolio and our ability to execute going forward, because we have the leadership and the professional capability to do a better job. And that’s got our focus. It won’t cause us to fail to look at the quality of our portfolio on a recurring basis, but I don’t think you should expect from us, wholesale divestitures because at a moment in time, there’s a little more pressure here than any of us would like. Our job is to go execute better and relieve some of that pressure.
Jerry Kircher:  George, I thank you for the question. Let me thank you Jevon for your help on the call today, and thank everybody who joined us. We’re going to focus, as I said on execution, and on streamlining, and on becoming more efficient as we learn more about our budget priorities and program priorities here on the domestic business front, and in the international community. And we’ll be able to share more complete set of observations with you in January when we’re next on the line together. So thanks again for being with us today.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the program, you may all disconnect, have a great day.

Bob Stevens: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. I hope this call finds you well and maybe finding some ways to survive the heat of this summer. We have a lot to update you on today, and I would like to get right to it so I'll proceed on the basis that you’ve had a chance to read the earnings release and see our updated guidance. I'd like to start with an operational overview then I'll walk you through the highlights on a business area by business area basis. In Aeronautics, there are three programs I want to cover, and I want to start with the F-35 program, as the Joint Strike Fighter remains our program of greatest opportunity and greatest challenge. And I want to spend a bit more time on some additional detail with you here so that you have a good feel for where we are in the program.  In the quarter, the government completed the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process, finding the F-35 to be essential to national security and a high priority. Extensive cost assessments and risk analyses were conducted and evaluated by DoD, highlighting areas requiring additional focus, adding resources to the development program and flight test and in software development while lowering the near-term production ramp rate by 122 airplanes.  The program executive officer, that's the senior-most government official on the program, that position was elevated from a two-star billet to a three-star billet, and Admiral Dave Venlet, a superbly qualified professional with lots of relevant experience, is now in this role. In recognizing that there are program uncertainties and risks remaining, DoD called for a series of what will be routine ongoing reviews to monitor performance and to make adjustments, and the first of these reviews under Admiral Venlet, known as a technical baseline review, is now underway and likely to be completed by the end of the year. Let me look at the program now in two segments or phases. First, the System Development and Demonstration phase. The work here I regard as the front end of the program, where it's essential to get the design, the development of the aircraft and the test of the aircraft and its systems right. I think of this as the nonrecurring part of the program. It's important to get it right here to assure that our customers get systems that meet their needs, and I think it's critical here to focus on overall performance to assure we get it right.  And then I'll talk about the Production phase of the program, which includes long-term aircraft delivery profiles that we think on the Joint Strike Fighter are likely to extend over decades. In my mind, this is where the majority of the costs reside and this is where affordability will ultimately be determined, so here it's critical to focus on costs. We are now at a critical juncture on the program as I think you all know of transitioning from the development program more fully into the production program.  In the System Development and Demonstration segment of the program, we're about 80% complete. We have 15 of 19 test articles currently being evaluated, and the four remaining are in build. This 19 test article total excludes the prospect of an additional carrier variant that was discussed during the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process. Of the 19 aircraft, 13 are fliers in the flight test program and six are structural test articles, and all of those six structural test articles either are in test or have completed their test. And of the 13 fliers, nine have now flown. In the quarter, we added the first carrier variant to the test fleet and the early reports from this airplane are that it’s flying very well. Also on the carrier variant, we completed a successful drop test of the ground test article, which simulates the intensity of carrier landings. Now here envision dropping the airframe from progressive heights that go up to about 12 feet. And in this test program, we noticed no failures or no load exceedances. So that's a very good set of results from this important test which is essential in demonstrating the structural integrity necessary for carrier operations.  In testing the conventional takeoff and landing variant, early flights already exceed the 7G loading conditions which is good. Static testing or measuring the ultimate strength of the airframe is complete with no structural failures, and we've begun durability testing to verify that the airframe will meet the plane’s 8,000-hour life.  We have two airplanes equipped with mission systems: one short takeoff and vertical landing and one conventional takeoff and landing. These mission systems aircraft give us early insight as to the performance of advanced avionics, like the Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar, the electronic warfare systems, the communications suite, the advanced targeting system and so forth. The goal here is to get some sense of sensor fusion or the ability to assemble information from different systems to generate greater levels of situational awareness, not just for the pilot, but for all those who would have information streams linked to the Joint Strike Fighter, and I think all are pleased with the early results of the test of the mission systems airplanes. Let me give you some detail on the status of the flight test program. Year-to-date through June, we've flown 136 flights against the plan of 118 flights, so overall, we've had a good tempo and we're running ahead in total numbers. When I break down that total for you by variant, you will see that the conventional takeoff and landing airplane has flown 56x against the plan of 22, and the carrier variant has flown 6x against the plan of one. So we're getting solid early performance here, performance on flights that was better than planned. And we're getting good feedback from the airplanes, and all this is very positive.  On the STOVL airplane, we have flown 74x against a plan of 95x. Here, we wanted to accomplish more vertical landings, satisfy more test points and get more information sooner, but we've thus far been unable to do so, so the question becomes why are the CTOL and the CV aircraft running ahead of plan as STOVL runs behind plan. The answer lies in the early reliability of selected components on the STOVL aircraft where we're seeing failure rates that are higher than predicted. Now, I'd describe these components to you as the ones you would probably not view as major systems like the engine, which is working very well. Recall we’ve flown supersonic and we’ve hovered with the airplane. Or the lift fan or the control laws or other such major components. The components that are failing are more of the things that would appear either smaller or more ordinary like thermal cooling fans, door actuators, selected valves or switches or components of the power system. So when these components don't work because of their initial low reliability, we don't fly, and we don't fly because assuring safety is our uncompromised highest priority. And often, the maintenance action to address these components takes longer than you think given the less significant nature of the parts involved. In some cases, we've had to remove the engine to get access to the component, and because we're in the early stages of flight test where we all exercise an abundance of caution, it's important to perform an additional series of tests when you take the engine out including ground tests, which consumes a lot of time to get to a more ordinary part like a cooling fan. We're now working with our customers on a variety of actions to address the STOVL flight test pressure. They include identifying the troublesome components and working with suppliers to understand and improve their reliability. Perhaps examining supplier manufacturing processes or examining whether we need to have them change the design of the parts or change the sparing or provisioning on the program simply to have more parts available. Given what we've seen, both we and our customer subject matter experts believe this component reliability condition can be corrected and the inherent reliability can and will be improved.  Together, we're also looking at ways to improve the overall flight test efficiency with the goal of improving tempo. Here we'll look at rephasing activities, adding some selective resources that we have already begun to do, looking at additional aircraft instrumentation and perhaps looking at different concepts of operation. And let me give you one example of the family of things we might consider here.  We'll look at hot-pitting the aircraft which means that we don't turn the engine off on the airplane, we refuel it with the engine running, and we go fly again on the theory that when the aircraft is flying well and when weather conditions are cooperating, we keep flying the airplane as much as possible. This will reduce the turnaround time of the jets, and interestingly, it could create a condition where we have fewer flights because the flight is actually measured at the end of the mission where we shut the engine off. If we don't shut the engine off to get more data by reducing turnaround time, we have fewer flights, but we can certainly generate more information which is the essential purpose and the ultimate goal of the flight test program. So we are working with customers throughout the test community to envision ways to get more utility out of the assets that we have.  During my last visit to Pax River where the Navy is testing the airplane. Going through not only a series of reviews, but walking the facility and the flight line, talking to the pilots who were flying the airplane and all those working on the aircraft, getting the advice of subject matter experts and meeting with Navy leadership, you just couldn't help being very impressed with the quality of the team, and this is a fully integrated test force, which means that the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps personnel are working in conjunction with other government personnel and industry personnel in a completely seamless way. The subject matter experts that are at Pax River are genuinely impressive. They have lots of experience, and they have lots of relevant knowledge, and they are a first-rate team, and they're working smart and they're working hard, and we have the full and complete engagement of senior Navy and Marine Corps leadership. So I want to take a minute to extend my thanks and appreciation for their professionalism and dedication as they work on this flight test program. Also in the SDD phase, we're developing software for the Joint Strike Fighter in five blocks. The second block of software, known as Block 0.5, which is the first Mission System software, is now flying on two airplanes. This block includes about 5.5 million lines of code. The early experience here is the software is of very good quality and functionality and importantly, it's demonstrating stable performance so we've been very pleased with the results here, although it took a little longer and required more resources than planned to deliver this block into the test program.  Block 1.0 is now in development and scheduled to be released later in the third quarter. This block will add about another 1 million lines of code to the prior software. With this software delivery, the airplane will have more than 80% of its total software. We're going to spend a concentrated effort with our customers over the next several months during the technical baseline review process that I described earlier, looking at the overall software program, examining stability, quality, complexity, productivity, and we'll make adjustments accordingly appropriate because getting the right software on the program that demonstrates full mission capability is absolutely critical as a component of the SDD phase.  In the production segment, we have 31 airplanes in the first three low-rate initial production lots, flowing in fabrication or assembly. We previously received long lead authorization for Lot 4 at 32 airplanes. We're now negotiating Lot 4 at present, receiving a very thorough and detailed review by the government customer that we expected. And Lot 4 will likely result in a fixed-price incentive-type contract when the negotiations conclude. And DoD also authorized $522 million for long-lead material associated with the next low-rate initial production option that's LRIP 5 at 42 airplanes.  We continue to see improved cost performance, and our learning curve projections including those associated with Lot 4, continue to support long-term affordability objectives. And I think it's fair to say that the production cost trends overall remain on the favorable side of prior estimates which is where we all want them to be. As with any accelerating production program, we do have some challenges. And our focus here is on retiring risks, working with the supply chain on phasing and quality and reliability and schedule maintenance, on reducing travels or out-of-cycle installations that put pressure on aircraft delivery schedule which we're seeing and working with the government independent manufacturing review team as they continue their assessment in the next regularly scheduled review cycle.  On some other matters, we have an agreement on the corrective action plan to improve our EBMS system and appreciate the help we've received to establish a better foundation here. And international partners continue to express interest. The Italian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement for a $1 billion final assembly and check-out facility that we used for aircraft for Italy and the Netherlands. This is part of our worldwide supply chain strategy.  Canada recently reaffirmed interest in 65 airplanes, and Israel continues to look at Joint Strike Fighter as a potential FMS buyer. On balance, then taken as a whole. The Joint Strike Fighter is showing strength in many areas of accomplishment with some areas needing more focus. In flight test, the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft, this is the airplane that will be sold in the greatest numbers and the carrier variant are doing well and STOVL needs more attention. In software development, quality, functionality and stability are good, and we need to focus on productivity. And in production, our learning curves support overall cost reduction and affordability objectives, and we need to address some schedule pressures. On the C-130J airplane, our production buildup from 16 aircraft last year to 26 this year is on track. We delivered six airplanes in the second quarter, and customer interest here remains strong. In the second quarter, we received orders from Kuwait and Israel. On the C-5 modernization program, we inducted the third airlifter into the line. I think you’ll recall overall plans called for 52 airplanes to be modernized by 2016, and we think this approach to life extension provides great value to customers.  In Electronic Systems, let me highlight two areas. In Ballistic Missile Defense, our FAD program achieved its seventh consecutive successful target intercept, demonstrating the ability to destroy a unitary target in the lower earth atmosphere, known as an endoatmospheric intercept, and this success expands again the operational envelope for this proven and capable system. This system is strongly supported as a DoD priority and offers both domestic and international sales potential. On the Littoral Combat Ship program, our second ship, the Forth Worth, remains on cost and on schedule with now 55% of the construction completed. Our offer for the 10-ship buy has been submitted and we should learn of the Navy's decision, we think, sometime in August. We have been listening very carefully to the Navy and their expectations and have fashioned a low-risk cost-competitive approach to the program on a vessel that we think would also be of interest to international buyers.  In Information Systems and Global Solutions on the Next Generation Identification System for the FBI, we've begun to fully develop and deploy a new capability to transform how law enforcement officials will search a wanted-person database.  In one of our horizon market initiatives, we were pleased the Tech America Foundation named Lockheed Martin's Ironclad the Most Innovative Cybersecurity and Authentication Technology of the year. Ironclad is a new technology that shrinks a laptop's hard drive, operating system, software applications and files onto a secure USB flash drive. This program's another example of leveraging our overall expertise in data security as we work to provide cyber protection solutions to customers. Lastly in IS&GS, earlier this month we were awarded a contract by DoD to manage the Special Operation Forces Support Activity, a contract known as SOFSA. This award with a value up to $5 billion over the next 10 years, represents a reinstatement of a contract that we had initially won last year and enables us to move forward to support our nation's special operation forces. As a result of our recent organizational realignment, the SOFSA contract will be managed by Electronic Systems as we move forward.  Finally, our Space Systems team continues to demonstrate progress on the Orion program. By successfully completing the flight test of the Launch Abort system. The system pulls the crew module away from the launch vehicle during an emergency and will significantly improve crew safety for future human space flight.  Other progress includes the successful completion of Phase I Safety Reviews of NASA's Human Rating Requirements addressing the design and operational concepts for the capsule.  Beyond operations, on May 8 Secretary Gates challenged the Department of Defense to examine its internal cost structure and overhead expenses, with a goal to change the way the Department does business. Secretary Gates outlined a goal to save more than $100 billion over five years beginning in fiscal 2012 by reducing unnecessary expenses. The objective is to redeploy adequate funds to pay for troops and modernization while sustaining a growing top line defense budget.  On June 28, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Ash Carter, outlined his new focus to acquisition professionals in the defense industry. The new initiatives are designed to achieve cost savings in the defense acquisition system to enable funding for war provider capability, to grow at approximately 3% annually while maintaining a vibrant and financially healthy defense industry. We understand this new reality of escalating demands on our customers and increasing constraints on the resources available to achieve their missions. This new reality requires that we adapt and drive affordability to ensure that we're doing everything possible to make every dollar count.  In support of these initiatives, we've implemented a number of actions. First, we've rebalanced our IS&GS portfolio, announcing plans to divest most of our Enterprise Integration Group and the Pacific Architects and Engineers unit. And there seems to be a good level of interest in these businesses. We also realigned our Readiness & Stability Operations in our Savi Technology business from IS&GS to Electronic Systems. These actions will strengthen our focus and our performance over the long run and help provide the best most affordable solutions to customers. We've implemented a voluntary executive separation program designed to reduce layers of management, improve affordability, tighten reporting relationships and allow for more direct lines of communication both inside and outside the company. We reduced our presence at the Farnborough Air Show by 50%. We've cut our advertising budgets and reduced our travel expenses, and we're going to continue to work at every aspect of this company with a focus on reducing costs. These actions reflect that new reality and are designed to enable us to continue to deliver the best value to customers while positioning us for financial success for our shareholders.  Even with this changing domestic framework, we continue to see strong alignment of our portfolio with overall program priorities, and believe we will grow more than the rate of growth in the base defense budget.  And internationally, we see solid and expanding demand for our portfolio of products and continue to drive on our goal of increasing international business content to approximately 20% of corporate revenues by 2012. Well, with that slightly longer summary for you, I want to turn the call over to Bruce for some additional detail on the second quarter financial results, and then we'll open it up for your questions.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Bob. As we've done in prior calls, we've included charts on our website to help with this part of the discussion, and at this time, I’d encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments. Let's begin with Chart 3, which is just a reminder that all financials in today's web charts reflect the impact of the portfolio-shaping we announced earlier this quarter. First, Pacific Architects & Engineers was moved from the continuing results of IS&GS and to discontinued operations as we have decided to sell that business. As a result of this, we have lowered our sales guidance for the expected level of annual sales, but we were able to offset the earnings impact and our EPS guidance as you'll see on a later chart. EIG on the other hand will remain in continuing operations as we evaluate a sale versus a spinoff to our stockholders.  Finally, we realigned our Readiness & Stability Operations, our RSO business, from IS&GS into Electronic Systems where it will be combined with Simulation, Training & Support to form the Global Training & Logistics line of business. If you now turn to Chart 4 and our second quarter sales summary, overall, the Corporation grew 3% in the quarter, with all four business areas achieving growth above prior year’s levels. IS&GS had the highest growth of 6%, due primarily to growth in our civil line of business due to work with the census program and other IT work for numerous federal agencies.  Electronic Systems generated revenue of $3.5 billion, with 4% growth in the quarter. This was driven primarily by global trending and logistics and tactical missiles at Missiles & Fire Control. Aeronautics grew 2% in the quarter, primarily from expansion on the F-35 low-rate initial production contracts and higher C-130 deliveries.  Space Systems grew 1% in the quarter due to expansion in Government Satellites and growth in the Orion crew exploration vehicle work. This was tempered somewhat by the wind-down of the external tank fabrication resulting from the upcoming retirement of the shuttle fleet. If we now look at Chart 5 and our Cash From Operations. Again this quarter cash was very strong as we generated in excess of $1.2 billion. And I'll point out, this was after making a cash contribution of $350 million to our pension trust in the quarter. The $2.9 billion through the first half of the year represents $500 million more than at this time last year. And looking forward to the second half of the year, we remain committed to contributing at least $1.05 billion additionally to reach our previously announced $1.4 billion in discretionary contributions to our pension plans. This remaining contribution to achieve the $1.4 billion level will be made entirely in the third quarter. And because of the strong cash generation this quarter, we are increasing our full year cash from operations guidance to at least $3.4 billion or $100 million above our prior projection of $3.3 billion. If you now look at Chart 6 for a discussion on our ongoing activities in share repurchases. We increased our share repurchases by almost 50% above first quarter levels, repurchasing 9.7 million shares for $782 million. This brings the year-to-date level to 16.2 million shares for $1.3 billion, well above our stated goal to allocate $1 billion for share repurchases in 2010. Our share repurchase actions brought our balance sheet shares outstanding to around 360 million at the end of the quarter, a new low level in the corporation's history.  Our next chart, Chart 7, will highlight our debt exchange that took place in the quarter. This chart shows all of our bond maturities over time which graphically shows that there are no debt maturities until 2013 which we've mentioned in the past. The yellow portion of the bars shows the amount of our high coupon bonds that were exchanged for new 30-year debt in 2040. Coupons range from 7.2% to 8.5% versus our new debt with a coupon rating of 5.72%. As the chart says, this extended our maturity while lowering the average coupon of our overall portfolio. Moving next to Chart 8 and our Earnings Per Share performance, second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.96. This reflects a 5% increase from our prior level of $1.87. And the improvements resulted from improved operational performance and lower share count. On the right-hand side of the chart, the adjusted EPS of $2.41 per share increased 16% above last year's level, including the discontinued operations items, and $0.19 for the FAS/CAS adjustment. Finally, I'd like to turn to our full year 2010 EPS guidance reconciliation on Chart 9. From what we provided in April, we were able to increase our guidance by $0.15 to a level of $7.15 to $7.35 per share due to our reduced share count outlook and improved operational performance in Space Systems. This level includes the impact of removing the annual earnings for PAE.  Moving down the chart to our GAAP EPS outlook including discontinued operations, our outlook is for $7.45 to $7.65 per share, which includes the PAE earnings removed from continuing operations, plus a tax benefit from the difference between our book and tax basis which is required to be recognized as we classify PAE as being held for sale.  I'll remind you that the values on this chart do not consider the effects of our previously announced voluntary executive separation program, and we'd expect to have that impact quantified during our third quarter earnings call.  Overall, the second quarter results were solid and particularly strong in the area of cash from operations. As I look forward to the rest of the year, I think we'll continue to see that second half revenue will have higher growth than the first half, with overall margins fairly consistent with what we experienced in the first half. We expect third quarter cash to be down considerably as we make the over $1 billion investment in the pension plan payments to get to the $1.4 billion level we've previously discussed. One final comment before we open for questions. We're revising our prior practice and we'll now wait until January to provide our initial financial guidance for 2011. We're still seeing tremendous volatility in both stock market performance and interest rate movement, and on top of that, cash harmonization still remains undecided at this time. So because of that we believe it makes more sense to wait until we have these numbers at year end rather than provide interim numbers in October. I also think this aligns us more closely with what our peers are doing in this area. And with that, I think we’re ready for your questions. Devon?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Nadol of JP Morgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Bob, thanks for that update on F-35 on the flight testing and everything you gave. I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on where you are in negotiations on both LRIP 4 and the redo or the update to the SDD contract. Any sense as to when this stuff gets concluded and if there are any -- because we’re late now relative to when we usually sign the contract, usually it's May. Now we're in late July. Any color you can give.
Bob Stevens: Yes, happy to, Joe. So I think the most accurate answer on LRIP 4 is that we meet recurringly and are going through great detail on the program. My sense is, I share your view that it's taken longer, Joe, but I think the time that we're investing is sensible time to make sure that all the details are right. I will tell you from my point of view, as we will take a fixed-price incentive type contract here, we certainly want to get this right so that we understand the risks and expectations. I think, there's a corollary for the people on the government's team to want to get it right from their point of view. So I don't feel that there's any particular distress here. There is no particular pressure. I just think it's a genuine effort for everybody to want to get it right. My feel is we're a couple of weeks away to finalize it. As I said, the ongoing discussions are fulsome. They are interactive and we are exchanging views and listening to proposals and counterproposals and options and thoughts and things. So I will tell you it's gone a little longer, but I would not characterize it as getting off track in some way. On redoing the SDD contract, I think that's going to take a bit of time, and I think that's going to take a bit of time because as I mentioned to you, there are a couple of reviews that I think we should all begin to internalize as ordinary and even routine on a program of this nature, and it might even grow to be routine on other programs that meet a threshold in the Department of Defense. In our case, it’s a technical baseline review that’s already commenced, and I think will be done -- I will tell you, October or November, I don't control the date on that, but we're certainly working in close conjunction with the review team, as well as an update to the independent manufacturing review team. And that's how I phased in my mind, Joe, the likely resolution of matters remaining in the SDD phase of the contract.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Access 342.
George Shapiro - Citi: A question on Aeronautics, Bruce. This quarter had 11.8% margin. I'm thinking that you probably increased the margin on some programs, maybe the F-35 production so if you could go into that. And then the second half guidance implies that, that margin is going to go down to 11% or so when it seems like it should, if anything, get better because you’ll have more C-130 deliveries, F-35 production will probably be higher so if you could explain why you’d expect it to go down in the second half.
Bruce Tanner: Maybe just a couple of comments on the quarter itself. As you said, you're right at the 11.8% margin in the quarter, and I kind of think of that, as I compare it to last year's second quarter, as we've got much more F-35 volume bringing in with it lower margins than the rest of the portfolio. We also have in the quarter three additional C-130s, and those bring with it typically probably higher margin than the overall portfolio. Those are being offset by reductions in both the F-16 and F-22 program so that's kind of how we got to the second quarter here. I'll give you just a – I just found it kind of interesting as I was looking through some of the data, George, just to put it in perspective. For the first half of 2010, the development program that Bob mentioned for the F-35, the SDD contract, is 2/3 of what it was in the first half of 2009. While the LRIP contracts, think of these as the early production contracts, is twice what it was in the first half of 2009 so you see the phenomenon where we're shifting significantly from the SDD contract over to the LRIP contracts. As far as why we're seeing some downside in the second half of the year, you're right that there are higher C-130J sales both quantity-wise and dollar-wise in the second half of the year. But at the same time, we're seeing some acceleration overall of F-35 activity and of course, that brings with it the lower margins in total that the F-35 program brings with it. There was -- you mentioned a profit step-up. There was profit step up in the LRIP contracts in the first half of the year, and we're not seeing likely a step-up in the second half of the year and that's another reason why it will be down in the second half versus the first half.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Safran, Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: On the cash, you have a tremendous amount of cash reserves. You're generating record cash. Doesn't really seem like you're interested in a large acquisition. So just a couple of things here. You’ve bought back a lot of stock in the first half. Does that continue in the second half? Will you be slowing that in the back half? Is there a higher dividend yield likely? Is there a special dividend? Could you just go over what you think the plans are for cash here?
Bruce Tanner: I’ll take a shot at that, and Bob can add to it, anything I leave out, Rich. Cash has been strong. As I pointed out, cash was strong in the second quarter, even making a $350 million pension payment in the quarter. I try to tee up in my comments that the second half of the year will bring with it a $1 billion-plus contribution, discretionary contribution to the pension plans. And we try to characterize that as being at least $1.4 billion in total for the year. So we do have the potential as we always do in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter of this year to take a look at where we sit pension-wise, funding-wise and cash on hand-wise and decide if there's additional contributions or not that would be beneficial to make in the latter part of this year. You asked about dividend yield, Rich, and I'll say, we always take a look at that in the third quarter time frame. We'll do that again with the board of directors at the September board of directors meeting. I think we’ve had some seven consecutive years of 10% or more increase in our dividend rate on an annual basis. We'll take a look and see what the board wants to do in the September time frame as I said. And lastly, I think you mentioned there’s potential for a special dividend yield. I don't see that happening. It's not under consideration at this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.
Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG: I was wondering if you could talk a bit about moving parts in Space as we move from '10 into '11. And in particular, the equity accounting for USA and kind of what you expect there, given the manifest. And also what your plan is currently for Orion as you see the authorization and appropriations kind of fight out and come to some resolution here?
Bruce Tanner: How about, Myles, if I take the equity part of that and maybe I’ll ask Bob to comment on the Orion piece overall? On the equity, well let’s back up, Myles, and just give you kind of an overview of Space in general. Space had a very strong first half, a very strong second quarter. And as I look at the second half of the year, I think that scenario where we potentially have some better performance coming in even than what we're showing in our guidance numbers there. It’s a real strong performance coming out of Space, particularly on the EBIT side of that. And I think as I teed up likely, I've lost track if I did that in the fourth quarter call, but I know I did in the first quarter call. I talked about there being a spike in the fourth quarter in Space Systems’ margins primarily because of the cessation of the Shuttle program and some profit adjustments we’d made there. I'll point out that our current guidance does not include the effects of that adjustment as a result of the fly-out of the shuttle. It's kind of right on the bubble as to whether that's going to be a fourth quarter event of 2010 or if it's going to roll over into 2011. But right now, that is not in our planning for the 2010 time frame. Once that final event has happened for the United Space Alliance and the plight of the shuttle, we would expect to see the equity earnings of that drop fairly dramatically. You should think of it in between the two of them, I want to say, between the United Launch Alliance, and the United Space Alliance, probably somewhere in the order of $200 million worth of equity earnings in total. U.S.A. is probably 2x to 3x the size of – excuse me, United Launch Alliance is 2x to 3x the size of United Space Alliance. So the impact won’t be the full $200 million obviously. We show that reduction and I gave you guidance, I think, in the third quarter of last year. We talked about longer-term views of Space's margins, Space segment’s margins. And I still think that even with the reduction in the U.S.A. equity earnings, the margin level that we're seeing for Space can sustain primarily because of some adjustments we're expecting to see in some of our government satellite contracts. So I don't see a large margin cliff coming, going from 2010 to 2011.
Bob Stevens: And, Myles, let me talk a bit about the interactions we're having with not only NASA, but other numbers of the administration about exactly what the Human Space Flight plan forward ought to look like. I can tell you the members were talking with or working hard and very focused on developing a balanced approach. Balanced with regard to funding, balanced with regard to probabilities of success, certainly balanced with regard to overall risk, and there is an interest in leveraging the investments that have been made in Orion, and Orion's performance continues to be rated as very good on a programmatic basis. So we think they're trying to develop a formula that gives them flexibility going forward, and we think that Orion will play a role in that flexible approach. Perhaps first as a crew rescue vehicle, which I think we talked considerably about, not launching astronauts from the earth, but sending the capsule to the space station such that in an emergency, the crew could evacuate, get on the crew rescue vehicle and return to Earth. But also having flexibility in the Orion configuration that over time it can evolve into a crew exploration or crew transport vehicle, that would include lifting astronauts from the earth. And of course, the capsule discretion in Orion is also unfolding with regard to a variety of propulsion systems. What rocket or type of rockets will be available to ride, when. So there’s a pretty comprehensive review right now, but our sense is that we performed well, that individuals see the merit and risk reduction associated with Orion. And that there will be a role for the Orion spacecraft in some fashion as the strategy unfolds. And I think we'll learn a lot more about this in the second half.
Operator: Our next question comes from Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Bob, a question for you on the F-35. When the program was awarded, Peter Aldridge put restrictions on it insisting that Spiro development would be necessary to contain costs growth. And we now read about the Pentagon complaints about cost growth and no discussion about requirements creep, but one presumes they're related. But we also know that’s the issue that has repeatedly hurt or sank programs. So as we look forward, what's the likelihood that we're going to be seeing continual cost growth on the F-35? Or put another way, Bob, when can we see that cost growth has peaked? Where are we on the bell-shaped curve?
Bob Stevens: Heidi, that's a broad pretty sweeping question. Let me give you the best feel I can. I do envision the program as having two discrete components as I mentioned in the remarks: the Development phase and the Production phase. The Development phase, while lasting a number of years, is the shorter phase and for me, the criticality there is invest everything you need to invest, to get a full emission-capable system while focusing in the Production program on driving out the costs of recurring production of that fully mission capable system. So we saw through the Nunn-McCurdy process and we may see in an iteration or two in the future, some adaptations or adjustments associated with making sure we're allocating resources in a smart way to get everything we need to have on the program. Now in that Development phase, I would say resides at least part of your concern about requirements creep. I will tell you, we're not seeing requirements creep or the generation of a lot of new things. Let me say in some significant or major way, and I attribute a great deal of appreciation to customers who came forward early and who made sure that the airplane would meet their operational needs and focus, and I think Admiral Dave Venlet here is a real strength because he brings an operator's background and he ran the Naval Air Systems command. And he understands how to think in terms of operational needs and he works with his colleagues in that way. We will see the manifestation of these developments of how well we're doing in demonstrating the performance of the airplane. And if there are any additional features we’ll probably see that unfold in the test program where people might, under reasonable circumstances, want to see some tests added to demonstrate or assure some aspect of the overall performance. We may see it in some software, but I pretty much think, and has been reinforced by the tests that we've completed, the hardware is progressively locking into a good configuration. And there are no major technical showstoppers to date on the program. We believe that. I believe all in the government who have responsibilities of overseeing the program believe that. So for me, I know the numbers of airplanes are big, the size of the program is large, and therefore the cost numbers are significant. But I think within a substantially large program, we're seeing adaptations that we’d expect to see. But again, I want to disabuse you of any sense you might have that requirements turn or creep are driving either our performance on the airplane or within the program or the overall cost of the program because that's really not a source of cost concern at present.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Bernstein Research: On IS&GS, when you look at the performance in the quarter and look at it with the new alignment compared to the past quarters, the margins really didn't change much in the quarter and backlogs were down, down about $700 million. Could you talk about what's happening there? And some of the programs I would assume that you've had issues with, those should be moving behind you yet we haven't really seen the improvement in margins. So could you talk about both those issues, both the backlog and margin there?
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Doug, I'll take a shot at that. I think your starting premise there that programs that we discussed in the second quarter of last year that caused the margin pressure last year, that the performance on those programs is largely behind us and that, and I'd say that's true. What we are seeing though is that if you take a look at the newly configured IS&GS. We still operate under the Civil, the Defense and the Intelligence line of businesses. And you should probably think of those businesses as comprising probably about 40% Civil and roughly 30% Defense and Intelligence, and what we're seeing happening is that the Civil piece is growing at a very, very fast clip relative to the other two. In fact, the other two in the second quarter, actually Intelligence was fairly flat. Defense business was actually slightly down. And so while we're seeing in the quarter both Defense and the Intelligence lines of business doing, I'll say, north of double-digit margins, the growth that we're seeing in Civil, think of that as kind of the high-single digit kind of business is offsetting that performance in the Defense and Intelligence and resulting in kind of a flattishness in the margins that you're talking about overall. Relative to the backlog, I think some of it is just the timing of orders. I don't particularly see -- speak to backlog in general for the corporation, not just IS&GS, but we don't truly have a whole lot of large-scale competitive orders. The largest one of note obviously is the Littoral Combat Ship which should be decided next month. Most of the rest of our orders across all the business areas, not just IS&GS, you should think of them in the form of farm and follow-on orders. And I'll say in particularly in IS&GS this year is particularly spiky in the fourth quarter where a large number -- it's always high to begin with, but this year seems a bit abnormally high for the number of orders in the fourth quarter versus the rest of the year. I think overall, this backlog in general, we ended up a little bit down in the second quarter compared to some. Some of those because of the delays frankly, and getting the LRIP 4 negotiation done out of Aeronautics, but actually I still look forward to the rest of the year for backlog. I think we're going to see growth in the third quarter and then growth in the fourth quarter as well, and I would expect that we probably end the year close to where we started the beginning of 2010 with.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gersky of Citigroup.
Jason Gersky: Just a quick question on the Space Systems and looking out as far as 2012. I think in the past, you've talked about some classified satellites that’ll come in starting in 2012. Can you remind us if that's still the case and what the scope of the contract is there for your classified satellites?
Bob Stevens: Jason, I think it is a classified opportunity. I think in this world, we can describe it as the next-gen satellite for the U.S. government, and it is a large opportunity. We still see that as likely occurring in the 2012 time frame in terms of the, I'll say the quantity orders. We’re right now performing some development work as we speak. We're already under contract for this, and I'll just remind you, this is a contract that was awarded to us sole source sometime, I guess, in the beginning of 2009 or late 2008 time frame. I think the order you're talking about is more the production order, and that's still on track for 2012.
Jason Gersky: And the scope of it and the size of it?
Bob Stevens: You should think of that as being multibillions of dollars’ worth of orders. And that's about as specific as I guess I want to get here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America.
Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch: Bob, when you think about F-35 in Europe and the current push for austerity in Europe, what impact do you think that’ll have on orders out of that region? And how do you think that could be offset in Asia?
Bob Stevens: I think that's a great question, and of course, one of the things we do as you do pretty often, Ron, is push back and look at how the global economy is changing and what conditions will likely result as a function of those changes. I note that the architecture of the program is such and the nature of the program design is such that most nations, I think, pretty soberly look out at a set of risks. The risks haven't really gone away, and one of the considerable risks is the proliferation of surface-to-air capabilities, think of area denial capabilities so what might have appeared more routine with regard to the use of tactical airplanes in the past is going to be anything but routine in the future because of these area denial circumstances. I think it’s human nature that almost everybody doesn’t want to think about the circumstances, but some people are forced to think, "What happens if there's unrest? What happens if there's instability?" So I think that’s one driver of looking and balancing economic needs and security needs. I think there still is a sense that we need to recapitalize on a security front. I think also, the way we’ve integrated global supply chain here. So many of the discussions that we are all quite familiar with on these types of programs extend beyond security to issues of economics and employment and interest, and that all makes a great deal of sense to us and I'm sure you as well. The Joint Strike Fighter architecture, in addition to being an interoperable system that shares the design and development on the security capabilities, also shares a component of the industrial base and it's very strongly integrated into the fabric of the program. So if you think of it in these terms, there is a bit of offset on the economic viability or vitality front because this generates value economically as well as consuming value economically. I think we have seen countries like Italy recommit particularly with the final assembly and check-out, a facility they were looking at the range of 131 airplanes. Norway has committed. We know that Denmark is running a competition, and they’ll make a determination. The Netherlands and the United Kingdom are reviewing the program. Previously, they have been favorable. And Canada recently committed to 65 just to round it up. Turkey committed to 100 airplanes. But we're also seeing early expressions of foreign military sales prospects, and three of those countries, in addition to Israel that is thinking about a total of 75 airplanes, three of those countries include Singapore, Japan and South Korea, I think very much in alignment with the framework of your question that either there will be additional demand from countries like Singapore, Japan, Korea and others in Asia or potentially offsetting demand. And I would think that over time, we would see an additional area of interest emerge and that would be the Middle East, where we have very important security cooperation relationships between our government and many governments in the region. And probably in a fashion not terribly dissimilar from the Korean Peninsula, there's a region of potential instability or at least concern there. Whether it also be proliferation of systems and sophistication and area denial that would highlight the advantage of a fifth-generation airplane like the Joint Strike Fighter, so we may see some interest a little beyond the scope of our planning right now emerging from the Middle East. Our sense is if you make the right investments in the development program to get a fully mission-capable airplane, if we keep our focus on production, work near-term production pressures and make sure that these are affordable airplanes at the acquisition price by driving down the learning curves and assuring just a sufficient level of volume to give us the volume to drive down the curves, keeping stability in that supply chain, we’ll create the most affordable, most capable fighter that still will have interest in Europe. Will probably have growing interest in Asia and growing interest in the middle East.
Jerry Kircher: Devon, this is Jerry. I know we had some extended comments at the beginning of the call so if we could extend the call here to at least another 15 minutes, at least 12:15. We want to go ahead and get some more callers out of the queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies & Co.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Bob, when you took over leadership of Lockheed, there were a number of things wrong, and you set about methodically fixing them and frankly created an enormous amount of shareholder value and trust, and you name it, and it was done right. Now sort of we've kind of entered into a little bit of a more unsettled period. You've talked a lot about the F-35 and your initiatives to fix that and make -- I remember when you used to talk about the T-46 and the shock you had on that program and how that happened and how that just caused you to think about enterprises and so on. And so maybe going forward, could you sort of outline some of the other things you're thinking about in terms of where you're not satisfied because it looks like you're starting to move pieces around to make the business better?
Bob Stevens: I don't find that honestly, Howard, when I was given what for me is a huge privilege and opportunity to play a leadership role here that the company was all that awful. There were things we wanted to do better and more of, and things we had been doing that we were very proud of and we wanted to continue, and I tell you that's my appraisal of the environment today. There’s things that we’re doing enormously well in this company, but we have spoken, I think, with great clarity about a new reality that we’re all facing, and every one of us is going to face a new reality every day and it’s going to require us to behave differently. I'm very proud of the workforce here. I think they are first-rate. Their technical skills are high and their commitment is on a -- these are professionals who believe in the mission and will do everything and anything they possibly can to be successful. Our job is to create the climate. So I think you can look at the things we’re engaged in now. Portfolio reshaping is a careful examination of all of the lines of business and all the activities that we are in. And we want to make sure we're tightly aligned. We're proud of the PA&E business. These individuals in the business do great work around the country, but the customer demand is moving in a way that is progressively moving away from our strategic orientation, and we're realistic about that. In the case of EIG, we're enormously proud of our 40-year-plus franchise here that we built, but we recognize that customers want to raise the bar on even the perception of OCI, of conflicts of interest and we’re going to respond, I think, professionally and well there. We'll work on cost reduction. On the F-35 we’re going to work on getting it right. There isn't any human alive who has even come approximately close to programs like this, who don't appreciate the challenges involved. I think I'm grateful that we're working with a customer who understands this, a customer who is committed to getting it right, a customer who will add resources to a development program when they believe that's a prudent investment in the long-term viability, and I think they should speak in a voice that has expectations of us, to be focused on cost and to do all the things we know how to do to get this right. I want to stay focused on attracting the best talent to this company and assuring that we’re giving them a high-vitality environment to work in because the commitments we're making on the F-35 today are not commitments that will be extinguished in four quarters. It will be here for decades from now so we do think of the business in terms of generational evolutions, and we're focused on that. I don't see in any way, and I know this is in your question, Howard, the velocity of events or the volatility associated with changes diminishing in the near term. I think you and us and everybody involved in this process is simply going to have to prepare for a more robust set of circumstances, and we're working to try to build that robustness in our processes and in our strategic planning and in the agility with which we adapt to changing circumstances which we think they’re going to continue and they're going to require more agility. Those are the kind of things we're thinking about. You and others will measure how well we're able to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn of Crédit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Crédit Suisse AG: Wanted to ask you, Bob, about this sizable Canadian F-35 deal. Could you talk a little bit about if there is any customization of the aircraft or anything different there and to what extent the contract accommodates that or any other elasticity in the price just given the cost situation now and how far out that is? And then just separately, Bruce, how are you sizing SOFSA on an annual basis? What do you think the flow is going forward and how much of that is war-exposed?
Bob Stevens: Yes, on the F-35, Rob, we have had a partnership relationship with Canada and eight other countries as well as three U.S. services for quite some time here with the award of the SDD contract in October 2001. There's been a huge amount of collaboration, and that collaboration includes the configuration, and I think you will probably hear when we explore opportunities in the future more oriented toward foreign military sales the discussions about how much flexibility there will be in the configuration, but I’ll tell you a considerable amount of flexibility is already built in the configuration to meet the demands that the operational command in various countries would have because that was the point of developing the kind of partnership and consortium we have on the F-35. So specifically to your question about Canada, there is very little discussion about some need for extraordinary tailoring of the air vehicle configuration or its mission systems because, frankly, it's already in there. There will be discussions, I think on a country-by-country basis that make a lot of sense about how those nations and those militaries will best support the airplane. And so there may be some tailoring of support requirements that would include some levels of industrial participation and so forth. I'll tell you that I believe you're not unfamiliar with this, and we are certainly not unfamiliar to this. Even as we just look back at our F-16 experience. There are various ways that we can help to support or enable customers to improve their operational availability, improve their mission capability and so forth. In the Joint Strike Fighter, at least in the near-term, it doesn’t look like there'll be a lot of configuration adaptability as much as there’ll be flexibility in approaches for sustainment support.
Bruce Tanner: Rob, I think your second question concerns SOFSA and the level of activity we've got there and perhaps what the war exposure there is to the SOFSA contract. Just a couple of thoughts from my perspective. First off, this is an IDIQ contract and we’re in the middle of about a, I think it's 120-day transition period to move from the previous prime contractor to ourselves. So we're in the early stages of recognizing any high level of activity frankly on that program. Going forward on kind of a steady state basis at least near-term as we look into 2011, I would think from what I know of the contract, we're probably going to expect somewhere in the, say, $400 million to $500 million a year range in sales. And I’ve thought a lot about your question on the war exposure and, frankly, my reaction is I'm not sure I know what the normal is for this activity. I mean, special operation troops are so engaged all over the world in any event that I'm not sure how much of that changes as a result of, say, a slowdown in Iraq or Afghanistan for instance. So that activity has not seen a whole lot of change from what we could tell for a number of years, but I will say all those years included the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. So I don't know that I have a very crisp answer for you there other than I’m not really sure what’s going to happen there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.
Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I guess, Bob and Bruce, can you talk about the planned voluntary reduction you've hinted at, and I know you don't know the details, but can you at least size some of that? Are we talking about something in the $10 million range, the $100 million range or what should that look like in terms of one-time cost? And then is that something that is an allowable cost and how should we think about the cost savings in terms of what you'll be able to keep versus what the customers might take back in pricing?
Bruce Tanner: This is Bruce. I’ll try to answer it, Sam, to begin with. I think Bob characterized it well to begin with. This is part of our offering to essentially vice presidents and director levels across the corporation. And we're early into the stage of the voluntary executive severance program. The eligible people have until September 7 to actually declare so I don't have a quantification for you at this point in time. I would expect to have that -- obviously September 7 falls in the third quarter. I would expect to have that quantification in time for the third quarter. Our expectation is that this would be allowable cost. We’re doing this with the idea of lowering our cost projections going forward as a result of this. And I'll say, we would expect to have some cost reductions in particular as we do not back-fill all these positions first off and second off perhaps if we back-fill at lower levels. We're looking at that as well. So from an overall perspective, I would think this would essentially pay for itself in fairly short order and that’s the reason I think it is an allowable context.
Bob Stevens: And Sam, I'd only add and I must just for clarity and accuracy, I have not had a specific discussion with Secretary Carter about this initiative. But generally, as we have all listened to Secretary Gates, Secretary Carter and others about asking not only the Department of Defense, but all of the companies that support them in their mission to take a very serious look even an innovative look or doing things that may feel a little nontraditional to get a better control of overall costs and value that support affordability, even to the extent of talking about ways to support initiatives with additional profitability or incentives or other phases. I'm not trying to put words into Dr. Carter's mouth but I think spiritually, notionally, this is very much aligned with the kind of initiatives that we all ought to be thinking about, and it is absolutely the right thing to do to tighten up span of control, to improve reporting, to lower the cost structure, to be effective and efficient in a time where efficiency matters more rather than less. And that would certainly be part of a conversation we would have about whether the costs are allowable because they're very good returns, we think, for both the customer and we think for ourselves. And the goal of Secretary Carter's initiatives are to find these areas that work for the government and work for us. So I’ve felt. I think Bruce and others here have felt, that this is very much in alignment with the general sense of what we ought to be doing. And as Bruce said, in September we'll know the total level of participation. Again, the program is entirely voluntary, and we ought to appropriately allow individuals time to consider their alternatives and then we'll be better able to report out to you more detail here, Sam.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: F-35, Bob, you've mentioned the need to maintain supply stability, and you've also said several times this should be a very affordable plane if you hit the quantities. Could you A, give us some color in terms of what is the leverage if the quantities are a little bit shallower build at the front end because of funding considerations? What kind of threat that poses? And secondly, maybe give us what your year-to-date pension return is, separate question?
Bob Stevens: We've talked about some sensitivity. Let's go back a little bit. We look at 122 airplanes have been taken out of the near-term build rate. We're looking at 32 airplanes in Lot 4 that's under negotiation. We're looking at the likely prospect of having 42 airplanes funded in the next Low-Rate Initial Production options. The Independent Manufacturing Review Team, Cai, which is not a Lockheed Martin-staffed organization, but a government-staffed organization. We work supporting them and in concert with them. They’ve done a review of the program. They will do another review of the program. I think, it's likely they'll continue to review the program. We welcome that review because it gives us a lot of insight. I think they’ve looked at a multiple of airplanes year-over-year that history instructs all of us. Let me say with some latitude would more or less be optimal. Now that's not tied down to a specific aircraft or two or maybe three, depending upon volume. But it is a multiplier of about 1.5. So if you wanted to hold a number in your head that may be a nominal point of departure, you might think that every year, you're adding about half again the number to keep that 1.5 multiple. It varies a little on how much automation you have in the factory, how much machine pace versus labor pace. I don't want to get into all the gory details unless the audience here does which I suspect not, but it is a little sensitive to that. What's really fundamental to this overall affordability issue, in addition to volume, which is embedded in your question and important is what costs are you starting at and coming down from? And what learning curve is most likely to be able to be fit to those costs? And that's the curve against which volume matters. And right now, on the things that are favorable about the program, I know there's more work to do, but on things that look good on the program with more of the cost being in production, the early learning curve data and the early initial cost positions look pretty good. And of course, we're going to have to work really hard to hold and sustain that good profile, and we're looking to help from the government to help us do that, and we'll be able to give you an update at the completion of the Independent Manufacturing Review Team updated assessment that we think is coming up here in the next two quarters. And that will probably run concurrently at least in part with the technical baseline review. And it’ll give us all good sensitivity about where we think we are, where the government thinks we are, where we need to make adaptations. So we're not overly sensitive in the near-term to production quantities, but we're mindful that in the long run, you've got to keep the volume balanced with the overall learning curves, balanced with the overall cost architecture, and we'll be working on that.
Bruce Tanner: And, Cai, you’d asked about the pension return. I'll just say first off, I'm pleased to say we have positive results year-to-date on the pension plan’s returns. We're not quite at the 8.5% level. So we have some more work to do for the rest of the year. I think maybe the bigger question there is what's happening with the discount rates because we have more liabilities than we have assets in the plan. And as far as the discount rates are concerned, if we were to strike a line in the sand right now because of where we sit from an interest rate perspective, it would probably down somewhat and so as I said in my opening comments, one of the reasons why we are pushing out the guidance for 2011 into the January column instead of October is because of the volatility we're seeing here both on the asset side as well as the interest rate side frankly.
Operator: Our final question comes from Troy Lahr of Stifel, Nicolaus [Stifel Financial Corp.]
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just one question. You talked about faster growth out of the civil IT business. Is that mostly driven by the census work and when does that peak? Is that kind of second quarter or third quarter or does that kind of stretch out into the end of this year?
Jerry Kircher: Troy, two things. The really sharp growth we saw in census (sic) [civil] in the first, I’ll say, first half of the year was due really to two main contracts. The first one was the census contract and you're right, that’ll start to slow down in the second half. I believe we've hit peak in the second quarter, and I think we start to turn down, and that contract essentially phases out by the end of the year. The second piece of the contract or the second piece of the growth that we're seeing in the Civil is really the Department of Energy Hanford Site contract. As you may recall, it was under protest and took a while for us to get going. We're now seeing the growth in the revenue coming from that contract, and that’ll stay fairly constant over time not just the end of this year, but into next year as well.
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Is that ramping up enough to offset some of the census work in the back part, do you think?
Jerry Kircher: I still think we’re going to – that particular contract, the answer is probably no. But we're still expecting to see the same sorts of growth going forward in 2011 that we're seeing in IS&GS today in its new configuration, but just because of other activity, particularly in the civil area, besides the two contracts I mentioned there.
Jerry Kircher: I think with that, Devon, I would like to turn it over to Bob and let him give his final thoughts before we break up today.
Bob Stevens: Just thanks very much for being on the call. I know we went a little longer than we usually do, but we did want you to have sufficient detail about our business. I thank you for your patience. We'll see you next quarter. Devon, thanks for your help on the call today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all now disconnect. Thank you and have a nice day.

Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to Lockheed Martin’s first quarter 2010 earnings results conference call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations; please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Good morning everyone, I would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2010 earnings conference call.

Robert Stevens: Thanks Jerry, good morning everyone, thanks for joining the call today. I hope you had an opportunity to read our earnings release and take a look at our updated guidance. Overall in the quarter our operational tempo and our execution were strong. Quality levels were good and each business area achieved expected results. In the United States since we last spoke, several events have occurred. The President proposed the defense budget for 2011 at $549 billion which was 3% over 2010 budget levels.  When we look out over the longer-term the future year defense program, that’s the projection that looks out over a five year horizon, maintains an overall 3% growth projection for DoD and then finally the Quadrennial Defense Review, that more strategically oriented document, was also completed and released and the priorities outlined in the QDR provide a solid level of support for a number of our lines of business and our programs, including the F-35 joint strike fighter for the fleet replacement aircraft, our THAAD, PAC-3, and Aegis systems, for mobile and sea based missile defense, the advanced DHF satellite for space command control communications, and the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance mission the communication supports, and our Littoral combat ship for advanced surface naval combatants.  Clearly our customers continue to address the dual demand of expanding missions and fiscal pressures and we’re working hard to support them by meeting our commitments, to shorten our cycle times, to overall reduce our costs and focus more on affordability.  Internationally we see the opportunity horizon expanding with demand aligning well with our product portfolio. And we were pleased with the international awards we saw in the first quarter that included 20 new F-16 aircraft for Egypt, two new C-130J airlifters for Tunisia, Sniper and Lantern targeting systems for Turkey, and a 10 year logistic support contract for New Zealand’s defense forces. Last year we increased our goal for international revenue such that we’d generate 20% of total revenue from our international business and we’re on track to achieve that goal by 2012, and yesterday we were pleased to see a renewed call for export control reform that was brought forward by Secretary Gates.  Let me turn to our operations for a moment where I think we had a solid quarter and we met some key objectives in each business area. In aeronautics Ralph Heath and the aeronautics team maintained overall a good operational tempo. And there are three areas that warrant greater discussion.  The F-35 is getting lots of extra attention, as a result of the restructuring process that addresses risk and positions the program for success and working through the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process. And I think here there may be some confusion about how the restructuring of the program and the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process align. They are both really borne out of the same fundamental assessment of the program that evaluated our ability to execute and included a variety of estimates of risk factors that could effect the program. The restructuring was initiated to reduce the overall risk of the program in order to facilitate the Nunn-McCurdy recertification.  When we look at the restructuring segment you’d see a 13 month extension to the system design and development phase of the program while adding $2.8 billion in funding, expanding the resources available on the program to reduce risk by adding software labs or adding resources to the flight test program, very specifically the addition of one United States Navy carrier version of the aircraft to improve our overall ability to turn around test flights. You’ll see the addition of an additional low rate initial production contract that we refer to as LRIP No. 9. We’ve had a re phasing of the production ramp while incorporating some buy to budget flexibility that means if our program performance is on track there will be an opportunity to add airplanes to the ramp rate, and then revising the program milestones. The Nunn-McCurdy recertification is led by the Department of Defense, specifically headed by Dr. Ash Carter, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and we play a supporting role in that process. I think that mechanism has been kicked off, there are five evaluation criteria that have to satisfied, and we believe that process will successfully conclude probably in the June timeframe.  On the F-35 we’re focused on execution and know we need to improve our performance. And a key objective for us will be to build momentum in the program. That’s momentum as we work to finalize the tasks in the development phase of the program, momentum as we efficiently accelerate the production ramp up of the program, and importantly to build on the accomplishments that are being achieved in the test program. In that test program two flight tests were particularly meaningful to us, the achievement of the short takeoff and vertical landing of the STOVL aircraft where we were able to measure the behavioral characteristics of the airplane, power, lift, control, stability, all of which were excellent and I think all that observed the test were very pleased with those results. And the first flight of the mission systems equipped F-35, which happened on April 7th, which demonstrated an avionics capability that no other fighter has demonstrated. So we’re going to continue to focus additional resources on execution and we’ll continue to strengthen the team on the F-35. In aeronautics we’re also building volume on the C-130J production program. We’ve commented to you over time our desire to expand this phase of the program building on our 16 aircraft delivered last year to 26 airplanes delivered this year. I think we’ve noted that those deliveries are likely to be phased toward the second half of the year but overall demand for the airplane looks very solid and the performance of the aircraft has been really superior.  Also in aeronautics we’ve been modernizing the C-5 Galaxy aircraft, this is the very heavy lift segment of our US lift component. And putting new engines and essentially new cockpits and new avionics in the aircraft. This program has successfully passed a very rigorous operational test and evaluation set of criteria and has now been certified as effective and mission capable.  We’ve delivered three of these airplanes to the United States Air Force and the current plans call for us to deliver 52 fully modernized C-5’s by 2016. Its my sense that if we continue to show real value here, real excellence and execution in performance, and if the demands on US airlift continue, there may be opportunities to talk about expanding that number in the future, but here again we’re very much focused on executing the current program of record. [Marilyn Houston] and her electronics team continue excellent operational performance across the portfolio and I think the Littoral combat ship deserves special mention. Our first Littoral combat ship, the USS Freedom was deployed by the Navy this quarter and it was deployed two years ahead of schedule, and I think the Navy is very proud of that accomplishment and I can certainly tell you that we and our LCS team are very proud of our ability to shorten cycle times which has been a key objective of our company and in alignment with the objectives of our customers.  In operations the ship’s already intercepted four drug smuggling ships and I think the crew of the Freedom is demonstrating superior performance in their prosecution of important missions. Our second ship, the Fort Worth, is more than 30% complete and is on its planned schedule and cost profiles.  We’ve submitted our bid for the next 10 ship buy that would result if we were successful in prevailing in the competition to an initial award of two ships and options for eight further ships and the Navy’s decision as to selecting the winning design for the overall 55 ship fleet will probably be undertaken in the third quarter, so we’ll keep you posted and look forward to that.  I don’t want to play true, the demands we have and focusing on competing for and winning, the instant contract with the United States Navy but I would note one of our objectives has been to try to look to aggregate demand for systems that have solid baselines that are flexible and extensible for a variety of customers and this includes bringing in international customers into baseline programs because the benefits are really quite manifest, very good for US customers because it lowers the cost of every ship the US buys, its very good for the international customers because it has the same cost advantage and its good for us because we have a broader more stable program that let’s us integrate the global supply chain more effectively, get higher quality, and really drive value for everyone. And so I am pleased that given the nature of the design of our ship, its performance in an operational environment, the steel semi plaining, mono hull design, all of which appeal strongly to a variety of international customers, so as you might expect we’re very focused on assuring we present good value to the United States Navy in our bid.  Moving to information systems and global services, Linda Gooden and IS&GS team have also achieved a key milestone this quarter with the commencement of their support of the 2010 census program and I know you’ve all heard a lot about the census. The role we play through our DRIS program, is the decennial response integration system, is to conclude form processing and data capture that standardizes the response from potentially more than 300 million American citizens. The US census effort as you know is crucial to assuring the right resource allocation across the country, its required by the Constitution and we feel confident that we’ll be in a position to enable the Administration to complete and review the census by December. In my judgment our work on the census is a good example of the broad range of information technology programs in support and services that IS&GS provides to a wide variety of US government agencies.  And finally in our space systems group under Joanne Maguire, we continue to make significant progress on the advanced extremely high frequency satellite system. This is a next generation communication system that’s an essential element in secure military communications and our first spacecraft is moving very close to delivery now in preparation for a launch in mid-2010.  These new secure communication satellites replace the Milstar series of satellites that many of you are familiar with. To give you a sense of performance and how performance adds to value because I think we spend a lot of time appropriately talking about our cost performance and our schedule performance as we execute contracts, we probably together spend less time talking about capabilities that we’re delivering, a single advanced EHF satellite provides more communications capacity than the entire Milstar constellation that’s flying today.  So while we face challenges from time to time on cost and schedule we do have meaningful accomplishments in adding to overall value. The capability of systems like the measureable capability improvement on advanced EHF, many of our satellites last considerably longer than their design life which we call mean mission duration so they last longer, that provides value.  And as I mentioned in the case of LCS we’re able to shorten the cycle time and move resources into the operational theater sooner which is genuine value to customers. On advanced EHV we’re under contract for three satellites but we envision the possible expansion of this constellation to include six satellites as DoD now looks to assure the appropriate priorities for secure communications in space. Before l leave space systems, we’ve had much discussion with you and others about human space flight and the constellation program for NASA particularly our component of the constellation program the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. Last Thursday President Obama when visiting the Cape in Florida, outlined a revision for the program calling for a modified version of the Orion capsule to act as an emergency escape vehicle to serve the international space station.  In the earlier plan that was described in February with the release of the President’s budget submission to Congress, the Orion program was to be eliminated. This new capsule we believe would likely be launched within the next few years and would certainly leverage and utilize the significant technology advances that our team has achieved since the original Orion contract award in 2005 and we’re very much looking forward to continuing work on the space flight program through Orion.  I think these operational highlights illustrate our corporate wide focus on program execution, on completing key milestones, on continuously improving quality, and importantly on focusing on affordability which our customers need. As I look forward I remain optimistic about our future because our product portfolio remains well supported, based on the recent budget submissions for 2011, based on the revised priorities that have been outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review and the future year defense programs, and based on the changing security environment globally, and quality of our portfolio as viewed through the eyes of our international customers, where I think there will be more international opportunities.  We also maintain our interest in the potential that may reside in adjacent and horizon markets as we explore opportunities in cyber security, logistics and sustainment, particularly the logistics and sustainment activities that are improved through the application of information technology resources, prospects for healthcare information technology or energy management, or renewable power generation.  So we’re carefully examining the quality and changes in those market segments. And I would be very much remiss if I didn’t comment on the quality of our work force because I think our team has had an outstanding quarter and that is very much due to the dedication and professionalism of the women and men who work in our company. They have not allowed themselves to be distracted by the increasing velocity of events or the increasing tempo of activities that we see around the globe. They’re very much focused on our customers, they’re very much focused on achieving excellence in what they do, and I’m very proud to have the opportunity to represent them and work with them. So let me turn to Bruce and he’ll give you some additional detail on the quarter and then we’ll open it up for your questions.
Bruce Tanner : Thanks Robert, to help with our discussions today, we’ve included some charts on our website and I would encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments. So starting off with the first quarter sales summary on chart three, overall the corporation grew 3% in the quarter. That was actually slightly higher than what I mentioned during the January call. Aeronautics had the strongest growth at 5% over last year’s numbers driven by the F-35 program which grew over 25% when compared to 2009. IS&GS grew 4% with most of that coming from the civil and defense lines of business, and comparisons with the 2009 performance were hurt somewhat because sales for the TMOSS, and remember TMOSS is the ground segment portion of the TSAT program, and the MTA contracts were included in first quarter 2009 results but were terminated in the second quarter of last year. Electronic systems was flat in compared to last year, this was actually also somewhat higher than expected given that the Presidential helicopter were in our 2009 results and we had growth in missiles, fire control, and training that was able to offset that reduction.  Space system was also flat versus 2009 and there we had higher activity on the Orion program which was offset by lower activity in our strategic and defensive missiles line of business. Turning now to chart four and our cash flow, we had record cash generation, over $1.6 billion in the first quarter and that did represent the highest quarterly cash from operations in our history. Due to this strong generation of cash in the quarter we were increased our full year cash from operations guidance by $100 million to $3.3 billion. If you now look at chart five, for a discussion of our net debt and debt maturities, as a result of our strong cash generated in the quarter our net debt is around $1.5 billion. That combined with no debt maturities until 2013 gives us great flexibility and a strong capital position for a number of years. On the next chart, chart six we’ll discuss our share repurchase activity, you can see we repurchased 6.5 million shares worth over $500 million in the quarter. We’re on track or ahead of our goal to buyback at least a billion dollars of shares this year. And these actions reduced shares outstanding to 368.5 million, the lowest level in our history and at quarter’s end we also had 22 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Next I’d like to highlight our earnings per share performance on chart seven, like many other companies this quarter we had an unusual charge as a result of the recently enacted legislation effecting Medicare Part D which we disclosed in an 8-K filing last month.  That resulted in $0.25 reduction to our EPS and if you adjusted our GAAP EPS for this charge and for the FAS/CAS impact the resulting adjusted EPS would be $1.89 per share. Finally if you turn to chart eight we’ll reconcile the revised 2010 EPS guidance with our January numbers.  Starting with our January guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share, the effect of the Medicare Part D charge I talked about earlier reduced the guidance by $0.25. We were able to offset a portion of that impact through and improved outlook in our investment income and other corporate accounts, and this $0.10 improvement results in a net $0.15 reduction and our new guidance of $7.00 to $7.20 per share.  So overall a solid quarter and in line with our expectations. As we look forward to the rest of the year we expect the second quarter sales growth over 2009 to be similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. And overall the second half of the year should have higher growth than the first half with the third quarter in particular having higher growth than the fourth quarter.  We expect margins to remain in the mid to upper 10% range in both the second and third quarters and then move higher in the fourth quarter as we discussed on the last call. We expect cash from operations will be lower in the next three quarters compared with first quarter as we make $1.4 billion in discretionary contributions to our pension trust.  In particular the second quarter will likely be about a billion dollars lower than the first quarter as we had a $325 million tax refund in the first quarter, a similarly sized tax payment in the second quarter, and our initial pension contribution also beginning in the second quarter.  With that I think we’re ready for your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse 
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse : IS&GS has been viewed by some as a proxy for government services as a whole and we’ve had some pressure in margins there over time, you were just above 8% this quarter but you’re guiding to about 8 4 for the year, if you could talk about what needs to happen to get there and then separately if you could simply comment on the possible loss of F-22 sustainment and what that might mean.
Bruce Tanner : IS&GS we did 8.1% margin in the quarter and I tried to tee up on the last call the January call, if you recall that we thought IS&GS would have probably its lowest quarter margin wise in the first quarter and that’s reflected more than anything else because of the timing of award [fees]. I always like to remind people that IS&GS has the largest percentage of its operating profit that it receives in the form of award [fees] and this particular year 2010 has a greater abundance of that award pool in the second half of the year, most specifically in the fourth quarter of this year. That’s just the way the contracts kind of fell out this year. So our expectation going forward is probably the next three quarters are going to be somewhat similar to first quarter, maybe a little bit higher than that but then we would expect some movement higher than that in the fourth quarter as we recognize the receipt of some of those awards. 
Robert Stevens : Let me pick up the F-22 sustainment, we’re under contract with our customer now through 2012 and we’re under discussions as to how we can best continue to serve customer interests beyond 2012 and without certainly any arrogance intended in my comment, we obviously know a great deal about the F-22. We have specialized skills and knowledge that we think would be of value. In other words to try to replicate some of these capabilities would have a certain set of consequences with it. So I think we’re in a very good position to continue the sustainment of the F-22 but we’re under contract through 2012 and we’re having very constructive discussions with customers now about how to extend that sustainment in a way that is valuable to them. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss - UBS
David Strauss - UBS: There’s been a lot of discussion in the press about this $614 million in award fees on F-35, could you just comment on your ability to actually capture a portion of those award fees going forward and what does your guidance for margin improvement on the F-35 assume there and then could you give us an update on CAS harmonization. 
Robert Stevens : If you look at the system design and development contract the award fee remaining is $614 million. What we are doing now with our customers as we work on what I described as the re base lining of the program is to reorient the scope of work that needs to be done, to highlight those critically important milestones that demonstrate tangible accomplishment, that is something our customers want and insist on and so do we. Its vitally important to lock up the requirements, to know what’s expected and to be able to put our resources and talent against those expectations such that we have very measureable results at a milestone point. We are then working with customers to allocate the award fee potential that’s embedded in that $614 million to each of those milestones to reflect their relative value. The degree to which we are able to earn that $614 million is absolutely tied to the degree we are able to execute the requirements that those milestones are associated with. If we are perfect or near perfect in our performance then we ought to be able to recover all or near all of that $614 million. If we aren’t we’ll keep you posted about how much of that we are able to recover. But I’m very pleased with the quality and the character of the discussions that orient our ability to earn award fee as a function of our demonstrated performance against milestones. In the vernacular this is described as more objective measures of performance rather than subjective measures and I think we all like the objectivity of knowing what we have to do to earn a fee in the SDD program.
Bruce Tanner : I’ll try to address the margin improvement question, I hope you saw that in our press release today we actually did reflect a step up on our early production lots on the F-35 program. I’d say we’re progressing about as we expected to on those early production lots and we retired risks on each of the first three lots that allowed us to actually increase the booking rate on each of those contracts.  I think your question was probably more related to the SDD program, the development program and there we still expect that we’re going to have some ability to have some margin improvement there in the latter part of this year and that’s more associated with the milestones remaining this year, quite frankly at this point then the negotiation of the remaining $614 million of award fees. That’s something that will effect us more in later years than this year. So, I think your last question concerned CAS harmonization, I think we’re frankly kind of my perspective we’re almost getting late to need in that regard and I think the latest that we’re hearing and it’s a little fuzzy at this point but that the harmonization might in fact actually slip out to 2012.  I’m not speaking for anyone when I say that but we’re approaching May here and I would have thought we would have had this done by now but we’re not there yet. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: You had talked about the C-130J being 25% to 30% of your yearly deliveries were going to be in the first half, if I look at what you did in the first quarter does that mean only one or two in the second quarter, so I’m just wondering what that means for aerospace in Q2 and then secondly you had talked about the ULA equity earnings having a huge fourth quarter in terms of timing, seemed like the equity earnings were heavier in the first quarter, is that just a timing issue. 
Bruce Tanner : C-130 I did tee up the fact that we thought the deliveries would probably be on a scale of about 25 to 30 in the first half of the year and 75% or so in the second half of the year. That’s still what we see happening. We did have three deliveries in the first quarter. You mentioned one delivery in the second quarter, we’d actually think it would be more somewhere in the four-ish range probably with the remaining deliveries probably 19 or so getting up to the 26 we expect to happen in the year occurring over the second half of the year with the majority of those in the fourth quarter.  Your second question dealt with ULA equity earnings and talked about the spike that I mentioned last call, the spike I’m talking about is actually associated not with ULA its actually associated with USA, the United Space Alliance. That is the entity that provides shuttle operation support and the reason for the increase in the fourth quarter is because as we have the planned wind down of the shuttle program taking place in the fourth quarter we think there are some risks that will be retired at that point that will allow us to make a pretty good increase in the bookings through that joint venture that will flow into our reported results and you will see that.  There will be a noticeable improvement in our space systems company in its fourth quarter performance versus the other three quarters. ULA was a little higher in the first quarter of this year but expecting it to basically stay similar at that level for the rest of the year, nothing of a timing issue in the first quarter there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro - Access 342
George Shapiro - Access 342: You commented that the revenues in electronics which seem to me to be a little better than what you saw, and space a little bit, so why not raise the revenue forecast for the year or were these just timing issues. 
Bruce Tanner : I think especially in electronic systems we did, I made, in my opening remarks I made the comment that we were pleased, I’ll say and maybe a little bit surprised at the results we, I personally thought we’d be down a little bit in the year over year comparison in the first quarter simply because of the Presidential helicopter activity last quarter.  We did have some good volume in the first quarter. I think we’re still sorting through that, whether that’s timing or whether that will carry through for the year, I actually feel pretty good about the year forecast in the electronics system. I wouldn’t expect it to be too much higher on the revenue side even if this does translate into a little bit of increase, I wouldn’t expect it to be dramatic by any stretch.  Space was basically tracking right in line with our expectations and I don’t see a change in anything we’ve talked about from a guidance perspective there either. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein 
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Can you comment on the long-term expectations for F-35 margins, and what I’m getting at is if you contrast it with other aircraft programs when they reach maturity how would you expect the F-35 to perform from a margin standpoint and particularly in light of discussions on potentially some lower volumes to the Air Force and some pressure from foreign buyers on costs, could you comment on where you think this ultimately will head and what could change it. 
Robert Stevens : I think part of what frames my view personally is taking a quick look back at airplane programs, I don’t want to say historically because that sounds like too long a time horizon, but I’m old enough now that I’ve done this a few times. Every airplane program I’ve ever worked on and every airplane program that I’ve reviewed has a similar set of circumstances that they face. We go through the development program, there are challenges in development. I assure you we do not take these challenges lightly, in fact I would tell you we respect the degree of difficulty in designing and developing and fielding new complex systems as much as anybody on this planet.  I don’t see anything at all extraordinarily more challenging on the F-35 that should adversely effect our ability to generate profitability and earn Op margins here. In fact there are several features of this program that I rather like. The more volume we have the more stability we have and that’s why we’re working so closely with the Department now to get a restructured program that increases the probability of success over the long run because that increased probability of success increases our probability of meeting all our expectations including margin expectations. Having the international content and I would say even with all the varying descriptions about the program that certainly these is no shortage of available today, international interest remains strong with eight partner countries and we have about eight countries who are not in the partnership basis who are making inquiries, so the FMS potential looks healthy as would the direct foreign sales potential.  So our goal and we addressed it a little bit on the SDD phase is to build momentum and reduce risk and earn to the maximum extent practicable, a segment of that $614 million, be efficient in our ramp up of production where we ought to be able to build upon the risk reduction in the program to improve our margin performance there which I think is well established in the overall behavior program performance and then look to the international marketplace.  The other feature of the F-35 that I think is very interesting relative to profitability is the overall sustainment opportunity in this program because the architecture is quite different, looking to us and our industry supply chain partners to play a significant role in the sustainment of the airplane over time. That again is going to be dependent upon our ability to execute and deliver value and that’s why we’re so rigorously focused on making sure we’ve got the right resources in the right place at the right time.  So I think there’s every bit the earning opportunity on the F-35 as we’ve seen on any of our programs. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley  
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley : You commented on the flight test on some of the successes but you didn’t talk about the number of flight tests you achieved in the quarter, how many have you done year to date and how is that versus planned.  
Robert Stevens : We’re happy to talk about any detail of the program at any time because that’s part of the building momentum process and in that building momentum I think there are going to be some periods where we do better than planned and some periods where we don’t do as well as planned but my goal here is to look at the long-term trend and opportunities and make sure we’re responding properly. I’ll tell you that if I look at January, February, March, and April year to date, we’re a little bit below our cumulative plan. We were good in January and let me say February and March and I think we completed the quarter a couple of tests ahead of the, four tests over the plan of 29, so we were at 33.  In April we plan on 29 incremental flights, we’ve flown five times April to date. We’re delivering more assets into the flight test program so we expected a more vigorous last portion of the month than first portion of the month. In every flight test program and we’re no different here, we face the traditional things of planned maintenance actions, which really effects the phasing of the 29 flights that we wanted to accomplish. And then unplanned maintenance actions which essentially means you take the airplane after the flight line and actuator doesn’t work, or you get a, because these are instrumented airplanes you get a reading on an instrument that is off nominal, we don’t fly the airplane when we have that occasion because we want to understand, the whole purpose of the test program is to understand the characterization of the airplane. Or weather delays which we’ve seen, you know I think a fair number of weather issues. We are going to fly this airplane irrespective of all of those challenges. So I tell you the arc of the test program is good to me. We’re accelerating through about 400 tests that we plan for the year 2010 and we’ll keep you posted at each step along the way because it is certainly important that we demonstrate the maturity of the test program. I would tell you what, my observation is sometimes there’s a more hyperbolic reaction to did you fly at 2:00 today and the consequences of that which I think may be amplify apprehension that isn’t warranted but on the other hand it is absolutely necessary for us to fly more [inaudible] with the 12 flyers that we have to deliver them into the flight test program and demonstrate the maturity of the airplane and we’re doing that.  And we’re not going to do that in a way that attempts to skirt any test at all and our behavior has very consistently been to put a priority on building a very high quality jet that meets all the key performance parameters and then go test that, not to thrift on any of the performance to try to accomplish a series of tests. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard – Macquarie 
Robert Stallard – Macquarie : You highlighted the strong cash flow in the quarter and your low leverage do you think this is an opportunity to have another look again at your dividend payout and whether Lockheed should be paying a high yield. 
Robert Stevens : We look at that as you might expect, I think our first goal has always been go get the cash and cash generation has been a significantly high priority. I’m really pleased with the company’s ability to generate consistent cash flows like this. I think it is a conspicuous strength of our company and a strategic advantage.  And then we very much routinely look at how we can best deploy that cash. I know you’re familiar with the discussion because its not a new discussion for us. We certainly look at dividend policy, we look at share repurchases, we’ve committed to at least 50% of free cash flow returned to investors because of the strength in our cash generation we’ve exceeded that goal consistently and considerably.  And we look at the string of pearls acquisition strategy which we want to continue to do but we’re very selective in those acquisitions. So I assure you that we’re very focused on both sides of the equation, the ability to go generate cash because we’ve earned that and then also how we can best deploy that cash to the interest of our shareholders and that will include taking a look at dividend policy. We’ve had double-digit increases I think for seven years on the dividend policy. It will include a careful examination of our repurchase strategy and philosophy that has really been based on opportunistic share repurchases, and then we’ll continue to work an aggressive screen in the string of pearls acquisition philosophy for those enterprises that would add sustained enduring value that would be at the right price and the right quality levels. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan
Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan: You went over the Orion change, I’m wondering though since the NASA landscape is so fragmented right now and I guess so uncertain and there’s this big $6 billion hunk of money for example out there for crew transport with not that much detail around it yet, are there other opportunities for Lockheed Martin to gain market share in human space flight. 
Robert Stevens : That’s a great question and I wish I had a great answer but the honest and short answer is I don’t know. We are focused now on working with NASA to get a more detailed description of what the crew rescue vehicle that Orion will become will look like, what its content will be. And whether or not there are more opportunities for us to gain market share in our judgment is going to be very much determined by the quality of that market.  If there are competitive opportunities we have a long I think well understood set of capabilities in not only human space flight but exploration, so we’d be interested but you know those opportunities are going to be characterized by among other things whether we’re asked to invest, what the quality of the investment would look like, would there be a return on investment. The one thing I think we know about the space environment particularly human space flight, it is a tough demanding environment. In other words the performance levels for escape velocity among other things are so extreme and the performance margins are so tight you really got to be at the top of your game here and we work hard to make sure we are at the top of our game. The other aspect that aligns with our interests on the overall space component of the business might be opportunities in the United Launch Alliance for more lift capability from the Atlas and the Delta systems that are in ULA but again that’s pretty much a yet to be determined as we see more definition on the NASA plan and strategy going forward but there might be some particularly in the near-term opportunities for ULA.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein - Banc of America
Ron Epstein - Banc of America: I was wondering if you could talk to the new Presidential helicopter program and when you think that’s going to, the timing on that and you are teamed up with a different team now, if you could speak to that. 
Robert Stevens : Well the timing is a little bit off on the horizon, we’re looking at requests for information as the Administration now looks to based on all that was learned on the VH-71 program what the right definition, what the right systems components, what the right mission profile would be for a replacement to the Presidential helicopter. So I would tell you we’re at the early stages of conceptualizing what would be required and what would be necessary while we’re including in the broader conversation the lessons from the VH-71 program. We have had I think very good experience and really high quality credentials in putting mission systems into helicopters. And that is an area of specialization for our company and I say respectively we’re good at it. And we’ve had a relationship with Sikorsky on the MH-60 Romeo and Sierra helicopter programs where we play that role in a Sikorsky platform in a fashion that’s been good for Sikorsky, good for us and I think highly valued by our customers.  And so it’s the basis of that relationship and the quality of the interface and the interaction that we’ve had there and our own reflection that we have learned a lot on the VH-71 program and I personally believe much of the mission systems work that was done under that contract would be certainly valuable to take a serious look at. And our relationship with Sikorsky and our experience of working together being the mission system integrator on their airplanes has been a good and productive one that’s familiar to us, familiar to them, and has given good value to customers and that’s why we did what we did. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment - Broadpoint
Peter Arment - Broadpoint: Question on I guess international sales you mentioned I think you’ve got a goal out there for 2012 of 20% of your overall mix, if you could just give us some color where is it today and what are you seeing out there in the international marketplace in terms of any changes in timing regarding achieving that goal and maybe some color on some major campaigns.
Robert Stevens : I mentioned earlier the compliment to Secretary Gates on advancing again the discussion of providing genuine reform to the export control policies of the country. We do this a lot as you would expect and our observations about the system are very clear. We have a lot of really good people working in the government overseeing a process to assure that we don’t diminish the security of our country because we allow technologies to escape. The people are good, the process is not as effective as it should be and what we’ve asked the people to do is to essentially work harder and harder and harder and more diligently in a process that isn’t serving us well because the process is too broad and too amorphous. And in that broadness it slows down the overall tempo of companies like ours to effectively compete in an accelerating global marketplace. Now I assure you nobody particularly nobody here, will ever take a step toward releasing the kind of technology that would make our country less secure and that is an immutable condition but we think if we focused a system on really examining with care the most critical technologies and absolutely safeguarding them with rigor and letting the rest of the market flow, it would improve our prospects internationally, we think it would be enormously good for the US economy.  I think it would probably be part of a formula that would add to job creation and then I look at our company specifically and note we’ve got a mature portfolio. That portfolio includes programs like the F-16, the F-35, the C-130J, air and missile defense programs like THAAD and Patriot and Aegis that already have international content. I mentioned the prospects, again without over reaching current set of challenges the Littoral combat ship interests me. The prospects of a joint like tactical vehicle that would have not only keen interest in the US but have the ability to build international constituencies. I like that very much because I think those kinds of program opportunities really create an architecture where you can give the very best value for our US government customers and citizens and tax payers who fund those programs, give them the very best industrial opportunities for international suppliers with whom we have great partnerships and also give those foreign governments great access to systems that are not only high quality in and of themselves, but tend to be far more interoperable and far more aligned so that when are nation has to act with other nations, these systems have already been balanced so that they work effectively and well together. So I do think our goals are achievable here and we build our systems architectures around the prospects that we can secure the technology we can’t release, they’ll be open and extensible and interoperable so that we can include international participants. 
Bruce Tanner : You asked some specifics as far as how we go about achieving the objective of 20% of sales in 2012, let me start off we had a good first quarter of events, I think Robert hit several of these but we did have the F-16 buy to Egypt for 20 aircraft, we also had a sale of some Sniper targeting Sniper and Lantern actually targeting and navigation [pods] for Turkey, and we had the two aircraft that Robert mentioned for C-130J with Tunisia.  Later this year we’re looking to hopefully close on a potential C-130J deal for the UAE worth somewhere on the order of 12 aircraft potentially. There’s also a PAC-3 deal for both Taiwan and UAE towards the latter half of the year. And I’ll just say that as we sit here today we feel good about our ability to get to that 20% because as we, especially as we get towards the end of 2010 a lot of what’s going to materialize in terms of sales in 2012 will be in backlog by the end of 2012. Specifically the F-16 program and the C-130’s, we can already see the international content that’s going to be delivered in 2012 and we know with a high degree of certainty what that looks like today and that’s what gives us confidence in that 20% number. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital
Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital: The new CEO at SAIC said the other day that the outlook for his addressable Fed services market was flat to down, that the days of rising tide lifts all boats are over, and that growth in his view would have to come from taking share from competitors and he planned to do that. I wondered the service business looked okay in Q1 for you, I wondered if you could compare and contrast your own outlook for the services business to that somewhat bleak outlook by the new SAIC CEO.
Robert Stevens : I’ll say that and we know and work well with the new CEO at SAIC we’ve not built a philosophy based on a rising tide lifting all boats. We’re very selective about what we have in our portfolio. I kind of highlighted the census, I think we have a very broad set of capabilities, points of presence in customers, well beyond programs in civil and in defense. We’re putting an additional level of focus and attention on the execution parameters in those businesses as we’ve described to you before. And I believe that the guidance that we’ve given reflects our expectation that we’re going to continue to perform well in these markets.
Bruce Tanner : I’ll just remind you we operate in three lines of business in that area, think of that as what we like to call the civil, defense and intelligence and defense, both civil and defense are roughly 37%, 38% in terms of the sales volume in the business area and our intelligence business is about 25%. Both the defense and intelligence, we expect those two lines of business to grow somewhere in the upper single-digit ranges, getting close to 10%. We think the intel business stay fairly flat, more a function of just the smaller size of the individual contracts being awarded there. The sheer numbers of contracts we’re seeing in the intelligence side haven’t necessarily changed but the dollar size of those programs has diminished somewhat. So our growth is going to be driven by those two [inaudible] civil and defense and we still feel that somewhere in the 6% to 8% range for the year is achievable. As we look at the backlog we had at the end of last year and what we won in the first quarter of 2010 that still looks very doable to us. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus 
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus : Just wanted to follow-up on that last IT, are you seeing pricing pressure out there for some of these new contracts and do you have to kind of lower your pricing or do you think there’s value add there that you don’t have to.
Bruce Tanner : I will say this marketplace has a lot more competitors today than it had a few years ago so I’d say there is definitely a greater number of like size competitors in the arena than say we had a few years back. I think that has put some pricing pressure on that. We’re seeing that, I think that’s one of the reasons why we’ve tried to tailor our margin levels at the levels we’re talking about as we think that’s achievable. That particularly effects our civil business given that our civil business has been the part of the business area, the LOB which has been growing at the fastest clip. That’s put some of the pressure on the margin, that’s the reason you see us at the level we’re at today. 
Robert Stevens : Thanks everybody for spending your time with us this morning. We’re looking forward to talking to you soon and certainly updating you on our next call together.

Operator: Welcome to Lockheed Martin’s Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Just a quick reminder, today’s call is being recorded. Now at this time I’ll hand the call over to our host, Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you, Bo, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I’d like remind you the statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the investor relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Stevens: Thanks Jerry. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining the call today. It’s probably a little late in the year for this, but let me wish you all happy New Year and hope 2010 is off to a good start for you all. As we entered 2009, we certainly had some expectations about the environmental circumstances that we would face during the year. With a new administration, we expected some new priorities, although it was difficult at the outset to predict exactly how those new priorities would unfold. Given the work that we do with our customers all around the world, we were absolutely certain that the global security environment had many growing challenges that we needed to face. And like all of you, we watched as the global economy struggled, mindful of the potential pressure that might be applied to our company and certainly those that might be applied to our suppliers in the form of insufficient liquidity or other impacts that they might face. By about mid-year 2009, we had a pretty good assessment of where the program priority shifts were likely to occur as the new administration made some changes and several of our programs were terminated or canceled or capped, some with immediate effect. Now, that certainly was a circumstance that we have not seen in prior years. One that confronted us with some sizable near-term operational and financial challenges that required us to take immediate action to rebalance our portfolio and realign our operations. We did by strengthening our executive focus on operations and reconstituting the Chief Operating Officer position, by reallocating talent and resources to different parts of the company where we thought they would be best applied and by making the difficult but necessary reductions and consolidations to emerge leaner and in good fighting shape. Even with these additional challenges, we worked to maintain our momentum and our focus and performance in 2009 continued at a high level, achieving record sales, record cash generation, a 20% return on invested capital and achieving our $5 billion segment operating profit goal a year earlier than we'd originally planned. Maybe more than anything else, we recognized that we and our customers are facing a new reality as they confront expanding mission requirements and greater fiscal pressure that’s simply not going to go away in the near term. And as the industry leader, we are working now to contain costs, shorten cycle times, improve quality and meet the commitments that we've made by redoubling our focus on operational excellence, which has been a strength of our company, with the recognition that we really should seize this moment to do a better job. If this sounds a little bit like back to basics, it is just that, because in our judgment, the best way for us to move forward to reach our potential and to continue to grow is to increase our focus on the basics of execution because that’s what our customers need most from us now. We have very solid fundamentals in this company. We have extraordinary talent and our access to the people and ideas is unconstrained. We have resources for investment. We have a creative energy in this company that drives innovation and a competitive spirit that thrives on meeting big challenges and it’s a dominant part of our culture. And we have the right long-term view. Our global security strategy is sound. Security needs aren’t going away even with fiscal pressures. They will grow in volume and in diversity. Security here at home and with our trading partners abroad is essential to our economic recovery and growth for the prosperity of our citizens and to the well being of many others. Security is so essential that Americans have always invested in what was needed even in times of economic stress and will continue to do so. So while some of our programs and operations were impacted by reprioritization decisions in 2009, our longer term business prospects have been strongly reinforced with commitments to tactical aircraft, airlift, missile defense capabilities and space systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems that lead to situational awareness and a command and control systems that allow them to work effectively, sea power through Aegis and the Littoral Combat Ship, precision guided weapons and a variety of other programs all of which have been strongly supported . We saw evidence of this support in the recently enacted 2010 budget, which solidly funded our programs. I believe we will also see this support in the 2011 budget scheduled for release next week, February 1st, that budget will likely target some top line growth and be accompanied by a request for additional overseas contingency operational funds. And I believe, we'll see this support sustain throughout the future year defense program and in the quadrennial defense review that’s also going to be released next month. With the changes 2009 introduced into our portfolio, we’re now in alignment with government priorities and needs. And our back-to-basics approach that emphasizes tight processes that yield predictable results, flexible systems that are adaptable and responsive to the accelerating pace of change, and those that can be used by multiple customers and services, will position us well for revenue growth greater than the defense budget while we drive to meet our goal of expanding our international sales to 20% of our total revenue by 2012. There will be a continuing demand for global security solutions and that demand will favor those with a proven track record of execution, which has been a hallmark of our success, and we’re going to build upon that strength as we drive toward perfect performance. Let me ask Bruce now to give you some further details on 2009, but I would like to come back in a few moments and give you some color on the Joint Strike Fighter before we open the line for your questions.
Bruce Tanner:  I like to build on Bob's earlier comments regarding our solid performance in 2009 and we've included some charts on our website to help with my discussion. I'd encourage you to open those charts now and follow along with me as I make my comments. Starting with the fourth quarter sales summary chart, chart 2, overall the corporation grew 13% in the quarter. Three of our four business areas grew at greater than 10% in the quarter. And if you take a look by the individual business areas, the aeronautics growth was driven by F-35 volume and C-130 production ramp up. I’ll remind you that we had about 16 C-130 not about , we had exactly 16 C-130 deliveries in 2009 and we are looking to go to about 26 or so in 2010. Electronic systems growth was driven by missile defense, tactical missiles and our stimulation and training business. Move over to space, space was driven by a classified satellite delivery in the quarter and also we had a commercial launch, where we had no commercial launches in the fourth quarter of 2008. IS&GS growth was driven mostly by the defense line of business, with some continued delays in our civil line of business lowering the overall growth compared to the prior year’s fourth quarter. We now turn to the full year sales chart, chart 3. All of our four business areas grew at rates ranging between 4% and 8% and overall the corporation grew sales by 6% to a record $45.2 billion. If you now look at chart 4, you’ll see the quarter’s book-to-bill ratio and backlog for each business area. Three of the four business areas had strong bookings with aeronautics, electronic systems and IS&GS all well above a 1.0 book-to-bill ratio. Space was less than 1.0, but as you saw in the previous chart, it had 28% sales growth in the quarter and this is a business area that typically has orders that sort of come in a lumpy fashion. Significant awards in the quarter included an almost billion dollar order for PAC-3 Missile work for the U.S, Taiwan and UAE, 11 C-130J’s for the U.S government and the annual fleet ballistic missile award for around three quarters a billion dollars in space systems. We ended the year with backlog of about $78 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion over third quarter, even with the 13% sales growth in the fourth quarter. Turning to chart 5, cash from operations, 2009 was exceptional for cash generation. It represented our highest total cash generated ever, and it allowed us to make $1.5 billion discretionary contribution into our pension trust. If you recall during the third quarter, we gave guidance of $3.1 billion of operating cash and assumed a $1 billion pension funding. What we actually did was contribute $1.5 billion of pension funding and yet our operating cash grew from the $3.1 billion to the $3.2 billion level, so $600 million improvement. We ended the year with $2.7 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. I will close on this chart by saying we're very pleased with this cash performance that allowed us to continue cash deployment practices for making significant contributions to our employee pension trust. We now move to chart 6, our share repurchases summary. I thought this was an interesting chart in that, it shows net share count reduction rather than total share repurchases over time . And what you see is 2009 is the largest year for net share reduction at 5% of shares outstanding. It also shows an impressive record of share reduction since 2005 increasing every year and total reduction of 15% of shares outstanding in 2005. Updated guidance for share repurchase in 2010 includes a $1 billion for repurchases and I will remind you that we have 29 million shares in our repurchase authorization remaining at the end of 2009. If you now look at chart 7, we will take a look at the earnings per share. The left-hand side of the chart shows our quarter-over-quarter performance for the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the fourth quarter of 2008. The right-hand side of the chart shows the same performance on an annual basis. The quarter had strong EPS growth of 6% but if you adjust with FAS/CAS impact, resulting growth is a very strong 18%. On an annual basis, year-over-year GAAP EPS actually dropped by 1% but I will remind you that FAS/CAS change between 2009 and 2008 was almost a dollar swing in earnings per share. Eliminating FAS/CAS, annual EPS grew by 11% to $8.54 per share. Now looking at our guidance change charts beginning with chart 8, the FAS/CAS pension summary. This reconciles our October guidance with the current guidance. We had a robust 20% return on asset performance in 2009, this greatly outperformed the 8.5% assumption in the guidance we provided in October and it more than offset a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate at year-end. For information purposes the final rate at year-end was five and seven eighths versus the prior year at six and a eighth . Lastly an additional $500 million pension contribution benefited FAS/CAS in 2010 by some $40 million or so. Net of all these changes, 2010 EBIT is about $55 million higher due to reduced FAS/CAS adjustment. Finally if you'll turn chart 9, we'll reconcile the revised 2010 EPS guidance with our October numbers starting with October guidance of $7.05 to $7.25 per share. Our reduced share count with the $1 billion included in current guidance, increased EPS by $0.15. The reduced FAS pension expense or the $55 million improvement from the previous stage added an additional $0.10 and in the higher interest expense from the additional $1.5 billion of debt we acquired in the fourth quarter reduced EPS by $0.15. So all told, that adds $0.10 to our new guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share. With that Bob will continue with his remarks.
Robert Stevens: I do want to take a few minutes to update you on the F35 as there has been much activity and even more speculation about this program. And I want to cover four subjects with you today. Whether the airplane is needed, whether we have the right approach and by that I mean whether we’re going about this the right way, whether we’re emphasizing the right things, how have we’ve been doing on the program to date and importantly where are we likely to be going in the future. Let’s start with the need for the airplane, which has been repeatedly validated and reinforced by the Department of Defense and will again be validated in the 2011 budget submission and in the quadrennial defense review . Here is why. Air power is key to a broad range of security challenges and missions. That’s been true historically. It is true today and will certainly be true for missions in the future. The aircraft in service today that are meeting these responsibilities are ageing because the operational tempo has remained very high. So, re-capitalization of the tactical aircraft fleet is a very high priority. The proliferation of antiaircraft radar and missiles systems continues and this is an area we probably don’t highlight or talk a lot about, but the sophistication of these systems does create a real threat for tactical aircraft and this threat highlights the value of fifth generation stealth capabilities embedded in the F35. And the F35’s ability to penetrate denied air space is superior. So the F35 is a high priority because it fills a very critical need. Next, there is the approach we’ve been taking on the program, which directly aligns with Secretary Gates’ principles for guiding what the Department of Defense will buy and what it will not buy. The Secretary wants to use proven technologies. All the technologies on the F-35 are mature, they are modern and they are the best-in-class and all have been demonstrated. The lift fan works, the lower observability on the airplane is effective. The data links and advanced communications provide unprecedented situational awareness. Secretary Gates also wants to find programs that offer joint service solutions and the F-35 is the model joint program by design from day one. And performance of the airplane has not been compromised to achieve a level of jointness. In fact the jointness of the F-35 extends beyond the three U.S services that will use the airplane, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps and includes partner countries. So when you think about our overall U.S security policy on a large front, an essential element of that policy has been to build partner capacity so that we can act with partners together on missions where we have shared values and shared outcomes. And that requires interoperability, not just in the performance of the airplane but in sustainment and support, the Joint Strike Fighter offers all those features. The Secretary wants the ability to incorporate combat experience into the systems and platforms. In other words, be able to adapt and update the system quickly. The architecture of the Joint Strike Fighter is designed to get more information to more people sooner. It has ISR capability built-in, it has communications capability built-in, it has the flexibility to adapt real-time to mission situations as they unfold. The Secretary has repeatedly said that we should not buy overly exquisite or unique solutions or ones where the costs or other factors will resolve at our ability to only buy limited quantities. Well we just had this policy debate with the F-22 and F-35 acquisition decisions where the F-22 was capped in production at a 187 aircraft while there was a full purchase commitment for the full compliment of F-35s. And when I look at the volume the U.S. government is likely to buy along with the volume that foreign buyers are interested in procuring, that number is likely greater than 3,000 airplanes. We think the principals that the Secretary has laid out are spot on given the circumstances that we together are facing. And our acquisition approach on the F-35 is in complete alignment with the acquisition principals in the department guiding what it will buy. With a validated need and the right acquisition approach, the question is how have we been doing? The short version of this assessment is that we’ve made great progress in some areas and not as much progress as we had planned in others. We know that the aircraft design is sound. Structural load tests are providing really good information. We know the propulsion system generates sufficient thrust and that’s critical in the case of the STOVL airplane because we won’t have any airspeed and that thrust converts completely to lift. In fact, the propulsion system that’s on the airplane today is performing at a level superior to the prior engine that enabled us to already fly an earlier version, not only in the STOVL configuration, but perform at a supersonic level in the same flight in the same mission. So, the engine performance seems to be more than satisfactory.  We know that the signature on the airplane is effective and as we’ve tested the airplane so far, there are no significant or critical design issues. We’re coding software today, that software coding is about 80% complete. The stability and reliability of the software is better than we have found it to be in predecessor aircraft, but I think we all recognize there is more software work to go. We’re now delivering airplanes off our production line and flowing those aircraft into the flight test program; 15 of 19 development jets have been delivered. But we’re behind in the projection that we made in 2005 relative to aircraft deliveries, and that schedule deficiency is about 6 months or so, and that’s caused a shortfall in the overall flight test program. But we have received some very positive data from the tests that we have flown in the flight test program showing excellent aircraft maturity and airplanes that require minimal adjustment or corrective actions after they land. There have been independent assessments of our ability to produce the airplane, one has been the independent manufacturing review team, and that assessment has confirmed the readiness of the production line and our supply chain to continue ramping up the production quantity. And our early learning curve data looks good, that early data is important because of the affordability goal on the aircraft. So today we’re at a critical juncture in the program, the transition from development to production. And this is a high consequence intersection, it's essential to make good decisions now because this is the point of maximum leverage that will determine the success of the program as we look to the future. And that success will be measured by flowing mission capable, high quality jets into operations as quickly as possible at the lowest possible cost with the least amount of risk. And risk here is an important concept. There is complete agreement between our company and the government that we must focus all energy on this critical program. The only question is based on progress to-date, based on all that has been achieved and that which has not been achieved, based on all that we have learned and respecting all that we and others know about the development the testing and the production challenges that are associated with airplanes, what adaptations and what investments should we make now to assure success. We are answering this question even as we speak and I mean literally in real time in on-going discussions with the Department of Defense. In our discussions, there are different views about risks, different assumptions, different estimates, different projections, some brought forward by us, some brought forward by the joint estimating team from the Department of Defense, some from the Cost Analysis and Performance Evaluation Group, some from the test community, some from the services, some come from other sources. This is an entirely healthy process. I have worked with each of these organizations and I have worked with the people who lead and work in these organizations and I can tell you they are professional, they have subject matter expertise, their intentions are good, and we all have exactly the same goal. Recognizing that the Joint Strike Fighter is critical and needed, what do we need to do to assure the success of the program. I know we are still finalizing this approach in our discussions, but I thought I’d try to give you my best sense in broad strokes as to the course of action we are pursuing. We all agree that we need stable funding and I believe that we will see stable funding as we move forward. We all agree that we should invest more resources in the development program to help reduce risk. That means more resources probably in the software development area, probably in the test program, maybe more test assets and more resources there. In conjunction with the discussions that we've had about increased investment I was asked directly, if I would consider converting some of the unearned award fee in the development phase to partly cover the cost of these investments and I said that I would because I believe it's absolutely the right thing to do to assure the success of the program. We discuss the production ramp rate and we want to strike a balance here that recognizes the delivery pressure to date, respects the content of the jet analysis and other views, includes prudent risk management provisions, but also one that promotes an efficient acceleration of volume that supports overall affordability and four structure goals. One, innovative approach that's been brought forward would be to set a more conservative lower limit to the program ramp rate based on the jet estimate with the provision to buy more aircraft if performance on the program warrants the acquisition of more airplanes. Let me try to give you an example here. In the FY'11 budget, that would mean setting a lower limit for production of 42 airplanes that compares to the prior years 32 airplanes. But setting a target let's say 48 aircraft if performance and progress continues on the program. In that flexible approach, there's a recognition of risk, but also the important incentive and expectation that our government team and our industry team need to try to do better job here. Also discussed in our conversations, has been the use of fixed price contracting, if the requirements are stable and if progress continues on the program we would certainly consider accelerating the use of a fixed price incentive type contract by one full year from lot 6 to lot 5. I want to create the conditions on this program where we can use fixed price contracts, I want to get the Joint Strike Fighter under a fixed price contracting methodology. I want to test this airplane thoroughly, I want to have a successful development program and I want a transition to production and build production volume over time because it's critical that we get these jets in the service. I think it's also appropriate for me to take a moment and thank the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary Lynn , and Under Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, for the time that they have invested in the discussions associated with this program which has been significant, for their professionalism which has been complete, for willingness to think creatively and innovatively about new and flexible ways to assure success, which they are doing, for their willingness to assign the F-35 the high-priority that I and others believe it deserves, and for their commitment to the program and for their continuing the investment stream that the program needs as we move forward. So Bo, I appreciate the time to offer to those comments, but why don’t we go now to the lines and check in with callers.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein:  On the F-35, as I follow this, it seems that over the past year or so, sounds like almost an adversarial relationship with the JPO and you all sort of taking one point of view and then the jet team and others taking different points of view, I mean the program seems to have slipped, just roughly six months late, at the end of the year. Are you talking now about a fundamentally different way of working as you go forward with the customer?
Robert Stevens:  Well, let me say it this way, I don’t know that I would expect although appreciate your comments, I wouldn’t expect the notion of an adversarial relationship. Let me tell you what I do see here. We believe strongly and profoundly in our ability to deliver this airplane. I don’t want this to sound arrogant or filled with hubris. We’ve built a lot of airplanes. We’ve actually compiled in our company all the experience that we’ve had, even reaching back to programs like the SR 71, the F-117, the F-16, the F-22, now leading to the Joint Strike Fighter. We care deeply. We care passionately about the commitments that we make and we are going to deliver this airplane. There are those in the government who have reviewed lots of airplane programs over time. They are smart. They are dedicated and I think they are equally passionate about their conviction. It is a good thing to bring people together provided that we share the same set of objectives and outcomes and I assure you we do. This nation needs to re-capitalize the attack air fleet. So there has been some energetic discussions that might from time-to-time appear to be contentious because of the strength of the beliefs , but what we have accomplished together over these last weeks and months and these ensuing discussions is a recognition that we’re going to drive to a position of accommodation that we will stop arguing the relative merits of individual points and what we will do is, is sample a group of collective points that will create the architecture upon which a successful program will be built. That means that we will go to a more conservative profile on the program because more conservatism here will reduce some of the risk moving forward as I said. We will keep the same level of funding but we will reallocate that funding slightly moving some additional money into development to ensure we are doing the right things in software development, the right things in test, and I assure you, Doug, I'm open-minded about any suggestion that would be on the table as to how to get this program right. But we will sustain a production ramp rate, in this case of 442 and create the flexibility in the approach to look at the prospect of increasing that ramp rate over time, which I think is a wonderful approach to meeting both the near-term apprehension that has been brought forward in good faith , recognizing where we've done well and where we had challenges on the program but also putting the program on the correct postures. So I think there is an increasing and positive convergence of the views here. And again I credit people like Secretary Ash Carter and others, who have, as you probably know have worked with us in some cases after long weeks of working in other mission areas that they concentrate on in the Pentagon, working through the weekends with us to get this right. So it's very much appreciated and I don’t think you will see a high level of, in your phrase, adversarial behavior as much as you will see co-operative behavior when we re-establish the kind of production ramp rate development base line that we all agree upon is necessary for a successful program.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter J. Arment - Broadpoint
Peter J. Arment - Broadpoint: Question on the JSF again. This is obviously an enormously complex program and difficult for us on the outside gauge how you’re doing and you gave us obviously a very good assessment of that in terms of the design and the propulsion and things that are yet to be completed, but how should we view it going forward for this year, is it cumulative flight tests, what's the best way for us to assess how Lockheed is making that transition this year?
Robert Stevens: You know, Peter, I can appreciate how this might be difficult to evaluate, let me tell you at least one reason why. There have been occasions where we could have put a jet into the flight test program earlier, but we deliberately did not and of course we don’t take that action without fully discussing the merits of the action with our government customer. The reason we wouldn’t put a jet in the flight test program would be a circumstance where we would know there is going to be a change made to that program, maybe an update to the software, maybe an update to the configuration, and it is part of the ordinary ebb and flow of any development program for systems like this. And therefore we would not have the asset in place. We would not be able to fly a test mission and the arithmetic scoring of that would say you were supposed to fly a test mission, you didn’t, you’re down one, you’re down two, and all of that arithmetic is fair game . But we believe that we’re in the long term optimizing the overall flight test profile because with the software upgrade, the airplane will fly a more proficient test program. There is a risk that if you know there is an update necessary and you don’t put it into the airplane, then you have to re-fly the sortie doubling the number of tests and delaying the tests program. You just pushed that delay farther out in time where it is actually less rather than greater to the advantage of the program. In that fashion, we and the joint program office and our government customers have been thinking about how you optimize the quality of the flight test program, have it thorough, and make sure you're testing the right things in the right sequence. I think one of the issues that arises is, when we watch the day-to-day sausage making and I will certainly say this about this program; there will never be a program that’s living life in HD more than the Joint Strike Fighter. There is a huge microscope on this program. Everything that we do is examined in such incredible granular detail in every way because it's a transparent program. In one sense, it's a reflection of goodness but then it induces a lot of discussion of, oh my god, you found this issue in the software development or there is this issue in the test program, or there's a structural modification necessary. I don't again say this in any arrogant way in the lifespan and experience of building airplanes and complex systems, this is not extraordinary, it is not a crisis, the sky is not falling. But when we’re subjected to accounts or some views of this, and certainly I think there's some of the views that you're subjected to, it sounds at least alarming if not downright catastrophic; it is not. And one way to measure this Peter is, there has not been a dime of funding taken of this program. The funding has been strongly supported by the department; the program has been strongly reinforced by the department. I would submit to you objectively there's enough evidence out there including a couple of our programs that if the leadership of the Pentagon feels that the system is not needed or that the approach is unwarranted or that the execution is at a point where there's real question about the ability of the system to perform, they terminate the program and there is a recent history of program terminations and program cancellations and program restructurings that don’t have the support and don’t have the funding. And I think we are seeing the exact opposite here. There is a great deal of support on the part of the government. It is what brings to the forefront this energetic discussion that Doug on the prior question called adversarial, that I think is more energetic and contentious at times, but with the intention of being constructively contentious . So I look at the process here and say we are making good progress. There is a concern about risk. What we want to do with the government and as I mentioned the discussions are ongoing, so we are a little limited today, but we won’t be limited for very long. We will get a program plan that the entire test community, all the services, the joint program office and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition agree is the right program, we will have milestones, we will have inch stones for measurement, we will share those milestones with you and we will score our accomplishments objectively, accurately, carefully and transparently and will be able to measure the progress on the program as we go forward. I expect to do that and I want to do that, because I think that creates the circumstance where people know there is real value in this airplane, we are making real progress in this airplane, all the things that we believe about the potential of the airplane are in fact true and can be made to become real and have these airplanes get into operational service and that’s exactly what we are doing in the process that I have described.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ron Epstein - Banc of America.
Ron Epstein - Banc of America.:
,:
Robert Stevens: Yes, actually I don't see any of that. I mean first of all the discussions that we've been having with building about acquisition reform really have been mature and adult, and I mean that. For example, I think sometimes sources report in a discussion about fixed price contracting, every contract now irrespective of maturity , irrespective of risk is going to be required to be assumed by contractors on a firm fixed price basis. That's not at all the discussions that we've had with anybody in the Pentagon. There's no view on their part that one size fits all. There is a very clear appreciation that there are technology readiness levels, there are degrees of complexity in systems, there is the maturity of capabilities and what we have all agreed to do is to have a constructive discussion that seeks to identify almost on a case-by-case basis, when a system or program will have the maturity and have the characteristics where fixed price contracting methodology can be applied. I must tell you, Ron, I'm all for that. I like the stability, and the visibility, and the confidence you have in an environment where requirements are stable, and funding is stable, and bring the game in the Lockheed Martin, make this our responsibility, because I think we play a very good game when we have good definition like that, and I like all features of it as do they. We have not been asked to undertake a contract type in any of our program areas and I'm talking well beyond the F-35 here and where we have taken fixed price contracts like in the case of Littoral Combat Ship, we had already built one, we have already understood it, the configuration was frozen, the requirements were set, and that’s exactly the kind of environment we would expect to see here. There haven’t been any other discussion about, I think the general elements that you would include in the definition of acquisition reform that have found their way into our Joint Strike Fighter discussion. But you would all on the call, and you particularly Ron, I think would be, we feel comfortable in these discussions because we are doing just what you do. We ask what were you supposed to have accomplished? What did you accomplish? How do you value and measure that? And knowing if we're validating the need and validating the approach, and again the approach of the program couldn’t be more consistent with Department of Defense guidelines as to the kind of things the department ought to be investing in. If there is good faith effort by people who know how to build airplanes, if the supply chain is cycling, if the industrial base is performing but not at a level that assuages all the angst about the risk, then what's an appropriate level of risk to incorporate into the program? One element that has arisen is associated with the most recent acquisition reform act, because that act, that was a careful deliberation by the Congress, directed the Department of Defense to load programs into baselines at a more conservative level and I think I understand the reason for wanting to do that. The discussions we’re involved in now say “let's agree on what that conservative level ought to be and why. What’s expected of the government teams and what’s expected of us, but let’s also see if we can craft some flexibility in the model.” So if the performance is better than the conservative assumptions in that baseline, the taxpayers and the services and the people who use and support the airplanes can get the benefit of that because we ought to be build more airplanes for the same amount of money if the less than conservative assumptions can be met. We are managers. We are leaders. We want a change of the circumstances so that the outcomes that would be associated with the conservative principles are not to ones that occur. We want to put energy into this. We want to put our experience into it and our government customers want us to do that too . So I think we are now working through after, as Bruce mentioned in his comments, after setting a baseline five years ago with puts and takes against performance, we’re going to get this realigned, we’re going to continue to invest the resources in it. The government is and we are, our talent, our energy and our experience and we’re going to drive to a set of successful outcomes, going from 32 airplanes to 42 airplanes is not a bad lift from lot-to-lot. We’d like to do more than that because we think that we’ll meet mission responsibilities sooner.
Operator: Your next question comes from Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co: . Your preamble sort of indicated that you took eye off the ball this year a little bit in a couple of areas. When we open up the proxy later in the year, will we find that the incentive compensation sort of reflected those misses and what are you going to do to sort of setup some incentive comp targets, because you sort of talked about transparency and obviously you talked about bringing Chris on to sort of help you in a number of areas so that we can see some either operational targets or some what I call program objective targets?
Robert Stevens: Yes, I can actually save you the wait. You don’t need to look at the proxy. I will absolutely assure you that this is a pay-for -performance institution. I and others are held accountable for our performance. When we think our performance should have and could have been better, then I will tell you, Howard, speaking for me personally, I think my performance could have and should have been better. I have been held accountable by our board. We hold our management accountable for this performance. Management holds one another accountable and you would see that reflected in compensation all throughout this organization. I don’t think we necessarily took our eye off the ball. I will say and others may have a different view of this. When you have a couple of programs terminated in mid-stride , it does introduce into the operations, an unusual turbulence. It takes the momentum out of some of the focus areas that we have built and I would submit to you if you look year-over-year in areas where that was not the case, where we didn’t have terminations, I think we had more consistent operational performance. That is not an excuse. We are a full-service house. We are going to deal with every and any situation that comes our way. It's appropriate for others to expect us to behave that way, that’s what we expect of ourselves. I think in complex businesses of a portfolio nature, there are always parts of the portfolio that seem to perform a little better than other parts of the portfolio. My job specifically, and you mentioned Chris Kubasik, and I'm delighted that he in place as the Chief Operating Officer, my job, Chris's job, Bruce's job, the job of others is to flow some of the prodigious resources we have in this company into those areas where they can make the maximum difference.  And that means encouraging every aspect of this business that had a really superb operational and performance year in 2009 to absolutely continue that beat in an uninterrupted way. And for those parts of the business that didn’t perform to expectations that realistically, soberly we are going to go address those issues, make the changes that have to be addressed and drive those businesses to higher levels of performance. We have been able to do that in the past. I expect to be able to do that again in 2010 and I assure you that I will be held accountable for my ability to do that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Bob, just going to a different segment of the business, specifically the Services business, and you referenced this when you answered the last question, but I think that was one of the areas of struggle this past year, clearly you lowered your guidance a couple of times and then here in the fourth quarter, you missed the number. I understand what went wrong because it has been a very difficult macro-environment for Services, but I'm wondering specifically within the company what took you so long to realize that because you had sort of this constant degradation of guidance. And then looking forward into next year, you have it bouncing back now with high single-digit growth and margins up a little bit. I'm just wondering how you can be confident on that?
Robert Stevens: That’s a fair question, Joe. I had some expectations of performance. I have been personally and substantially involved in looking at the Services business components and actually I would tell you that we did not treat that business any differently than we treat any other business relative to, let me say, time and attention for executive resources and so forth. I will tell you that it is my sense that the business, let's think in terms of time spans of discretion, how much volatility, how much visibility do you have in the business, how far can you look forward? If you look at our airplane business or our space systems business, I think you get one range of visibility.  I think one of the observations I've had Joe and I think it's embedded in your question about why didn't you move faster, why didn't you see more clearly? My sense is that it's just a little harder to look forward in a services business where there’s not that level of visibility or the uncertainty sort of builds faster, sooner. And you have to make some assumptions about how you will perform internally and how markets perform externally, and that was a good lesson I think for me and us to see and we’re trying to adapt, adjust to that now and get greater acuity and greater visibility, and put some people and systems in place that will help that out a bit.
Bruce Tanner: I'll add just my view of it. You talked about the fourth quarter maybe not coming in flight as strong as we had hoped for and I'd say that’s a fair assessment, I don't think we've seen the improvements occurring as we had hoped they would by now. On the other hand, we haven't seen deteriorations either. I characterize it as we've kind of stabilized the business at this point, and I think we've made some pretty significant changes, particularly in people and processes. I feel really good about what we've done on kind of the front end of the business to make sure we have the right contracts filters, if you will, to make sure we're signing up the good deals. I think we've made real good strides there. And as far as the confidence in 2010, as I look at 2010, there’s much less reliance on larger awards where we need to unseat incumbents as compared to what we did in 2009, and that allows for the opportunity for protest in 2009 as well. So if we look at 2010, the first half there, fewer large competitions in general and secondly where there are in fact competitions we tend to be the incumbent. So assuming we do win those contracts, protest by the losing competitor would not reduce the revenue because of our incumbency. And you mentioned the margin, we do have a slight margin improvement year-over-year in IS&GS and I think that’s within our ability to perform at that level.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital.
Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital: Can you help us out a little bit with and I don’t really want to focus too much on all the stuff about the Joint Strike Fighter, but what is really being debated, it sounds like you are, we read all the stuff in the rags about some changes that moved money and lowered the rates. Are there open issues that you are still fighting for like the chance to get back, that you would like to have, but Ash and Bill and others and or maybe the Congress do you want to approve this? What is the open issue that you would like to see and who is it that needs to go along with it?
Robert Stevens: Yeah, that’s kind of a broad question, I’ll do my best, Joe. So there is not a lot of discussion let me say that has Congressional impetus right now. And I would just note that in prior budget submissions by the executive branch the requests for funding for the Joint Strike Fighter have been honored, save for the discussion about the second engine. So let me just separate that, because that’s not really part of what I am talking.
Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital: No, I don’t want to know about the second engine.
Robert Stevens: So what we're talking about inside the Pentagon today is, let me use the term reconciliation between a number of sets of assumptions, projections, estimates and let me say experience. And I'll use two positions that will maybe contrast this although there are more than two. The joint estimating team has done a careful analysis of the development of lots of aircraft programs. And they make a set of assumptions here about the things that can go wrong and might go wrong and it's all a probability assessment. And we do the same thing and others do that. I think we don't have the same conclusion when we look at where we are on the program today and of course we're compelled here to look 5 to 10 years out about the kind of things that would happen. We don't have the same conclusions. The joint program office has a set of conclusions that are slightly different than ours, say - let's say more time and more cost and let me just assume more risk. And then the join estimating team has even more, a sense of more risk and more exposure than the joint program office. So we are all talking about essentially the same test program. The question is, well, what would be the right number of test assets to put into a test program, how many flyers do you need to fly cards that have test points that it would allow us to test how many test points before you know with confidence the airplane will always do what you wanted to do. I'll set up some purely theoretical boundaries; you can't test everything that an airplane can do because you'll test the airplane forever. Now that’s not one of the proposals on the table but it sets the upper bound. So if you are not going to test everything in perpetuity, what are you going test, and when are you going to test it? There are different views about that, there are different views about how much that costs and how much incremental value you might get from a new series of tests to learn what information. As I said, this is not unhealthy. When you bring subject matter experts together who care, who have deep knowledge and who understand what's going on here, it may take some time to get agreement but you will get agreement and that’s what we are driving for. They are absolutely well intentioned, we want to test this airplane, we are not going to be associated with a system that doesn’t work. I personally believe the F-35 is going to find its way into the panoply of truly great airplanes, truly great airplanes. I think in the future when we look back at this program, we'll all be enormously proud of the work that we have done here. But to get to that point, we've got to do the right things now. I think we saw little microcosms of some of this discussion say on a system like JASSM. We had reliability on challenge on JASSM and I know you were exposed to some reports of this would suggest maybe in a very alarming way this will never work, the program is out of control, it can't be recovered, we didn’t have that belief and I hope Joe I can convey to you we don’t have that belief because we think just know better. We didn’t have that belief because we are steeped into the details of the program, we have terrific subject matter experts here, we have everything a company would need to do a great job in a technology program like this and we said if we can bring this forward, if we can understand the phenomenology, if we can do the analysis, if we can get to the root cause, we can improve this system and here is our new prediction for how it will perform. And on the JASSM case, that worked out well and we worked with our customer. It wasn’t necessarily at every intersect straight and level and smooth, but we got the job done. I’m absolutely confident we’re going to get the job done on the Joint Strike Fighter. I’m confident that the intentions of all the parties are very good, that’s been expressed to me in many ways. And that’s what we are getting agreement on now and because the program has three U.S. service variants and it has international content, the field of play is bigger, but essentially that’s the process we’re on.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Richard Safran - Buckingham Research Group.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research:  I wanted to ask you on your -- on cash deployment and your share buyback, what you are anticipating or what you’re including in guidance and what you are anticipating for buybacks, it just seems a little bit lighter than what I would have expected especially when I look back at what you have done in the past. I just was wondering, is there an interest for example in doing a large acquisition in 2010 and I just wanted to know if you also just cover in general just what you are thinking about M&A activity in 2010?
Robert Stevens:  I’ll ask Bruce to give you a little comment on the share repurchase, because I think that will be helpful, relative to a big acquisition in 2010 that’s not in our planning. We like the acquisition approach we’ve had, it’s been described as a string of pearls. To me, it’s a very clear, very precise, very measurable approach relative to our ability to add value, provide important technology, adjuncts to our portfolio, be able to serve customers better. Actually, my feel at the beginning of the year is that there may not be as much M&A deal flow I think just in a general sense. I don’t know if prices and valuations are going to come inline with the kind of capabilities that folks might be looking forward. In our case, we have never really set an objective to let's go buy something big. We don’t need that kind of action here. And frankly, I would rather focus our attention and our effort on initiatives like the Joint Strike Fighter and other operational improvements from which I think we can absolutely yield greater value. And I ask Bruce to give you a comment on the share repurchases.
Bruce Tanner: We've historically have, as Bob just said, we are going to get back 50% or more free cash flow in the form of dividends or share repurchases. And at the least as I went around and talked to a number of investors say in the later half or later quarter of last year, a number of them expressed concern particularly as we started talking about the funding requirements of our pension plan going forward, that would we be able to continue to the sort of cash deployment activities as we've done in the past? And so when we took the $1.5 billion out in the fourth quarter of last year, we obviously had a lot of cash on the balance sheet at that time. With that infusion, we made a large significant contribution to the pension plan. But we wanted to demonstrate, and the reason we came out with the guidance we did that included a $1 billion of share repurchases in 2010 is we wanted to send the message frankly that we are going to continue with the cash deployment practices that we've demonstrated in the past. If you just take a look at the percent of free cash flow that we are giving back in 2010 at the levels we're talking about, it's already 89%. And as we go through the year 2010, we have the firepower to do acquisitions. As Bob said, we are not looking for the big bang acquisition, but we do have firepower to do some acquisitions. And if in fact, we continue with the kind of cash performance that we've demonstrated amazingly well in 2009, we will have the firepower to do even better share repurchases throughout the year.
Robert Stevens: Hey Bo, let me just check in with you because I see we’ve kind of gone an hour. Let me ask are there others still on the line.
Operator: Your next question comes from George Shapiro - Access 342
George Shapiro - Access 342:  I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. First I assume that the JSF margin that you had articulated before would be going from around 5% to 6% is still intact despite all of the discussions that we have been hearing.
Bruce Tanner:  No changes whatsoever, George. 
George Shapiro - Access 342: Okay and then on the other side, I find it ironic that every sector except ISG, you were well above your guidance and the one I highlight or ask you to put some detail on particularly in space, you had raised the guidance significantly from October to January and you are still well ahead of it and yet I didn’t see you raise the projection that you put out for 2010, so I was just wondering why not?
Bruce Tanner: As I’ve said in my discussion going through the chart deck, there were two delivery events, if you will, that happened in the fourth quarter of 2009. One I mentioned was a classified satellite delivery, that one was frankly kind of on the bubble of what we thought that was going to occur at the end of 2009 or 2010. When we talked to you in October, we thought it was more likely to happen in the 2010 timeframe, it turns out it happened sooner than that, it happened very successfully. So that event was close to a $400 million item in and of itself. On top of that, as I mentioned, we have one commercial launch vehicle that went off in the fourth quarter. We have zero commercial launch vehicles in 2010 plan. So if you just take a look at that delta for those two particular items, we’re down $500 million for two events that are likely not to occur again in 2010. Helping to offset that in 2010 frankly is, we’re seeing some growth in our advanced VHF, extreme high frequency satellite and as well as some classified space activities in 2010. So that’s helping to mitigate, if you will, the loss of those two events.
Operator: Your next question comes from Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley & Co.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley & Co.: 
 :
Robert Stevens: That’s an obviously an area of keen interest for us, and it is also an area that not only we but I think others in the industry have advanced with regard to discussions to try to get some clarification here. I will say a statement that hopefully sounds like something you would expect to hear from us. We don't want to be in a conflict of interest position. It doesn't ever work well for the business. It doesn't serve long-term interest. We don't want to find ourselves ever, and I'll use this as a hypothetical position, where we would build a precision guided system and fly it down the range, then we on the other side would be the ones to evaluate the performance of that. That’s unhealthy. We know that, we avoid that. That is the kind of conflict of interest that we would avoid. Whether any areas of sensitivity in the work that our company does, we set up firewalls, and there are, I think time tested means and mechanisms here that work really effectively for this kind of discussion. What our company and I think I can say this, what the industry has asked for is, could we get some clarification and some guidance out of the Department of Defense relative to what the rules of engagement here will be? What activities here would be prohibited, what kinds of businesses, what kinds of initiatives, what kinds of task orders and then we’ll go structure our business accordingly, because we are going to play by the rules. We just want to make sure we understand what those rules are. So there is no intention or expectation on our part at the moment to divest any segment of our business. If we learn something when the draft guidance is released and my best recollection of the timeline Heidi would be probably sometime let me say in February, we are likely to get some draft guidance outlines here for what a conflict of interest policy would look like. Then we’ll, if we have the opportunity, we’ll make comments to that policy and whatever that policy is we will certainly abide by it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: Hopefully this will be a relatively discreet question. The independent manufacturing team set up a number of discrete milestone for you to achieve before they’d recommend your movements to higher levels. Can you give us just a couple of those long poles in the recommendations? And second you had previously talked about $15 billion on JSF in 2015; given what you see today what does it look like?
Robert Stevens: Yeah, I am going to differ on the second half because a lot of that's going to depend on the ramp rate and those assessment smiles [ph] that we provided were on the, let me say existing base line. To the extent that we load conservative numbers into production and are able to beat them, I think there will be a range of numbers. I will commit this to you when we get better visibility as to the discreet points and expectations about how we'll load a production base line here probably by the next time we talk, next quarter on this call, we will have some more discreet detail there. Relative to the independent manufacturing review team, I think they always look at, how do you get more maturities sooner into a production line, do you have the right level of tools, do you have the right level of training, do you have the right level of expertise, that gives you like an interesting I think data point that applies to fiscal '11. The independent manufacturing review team concluded that we would be in a position to produce about 48 airplanes in that fiscal '11 time period. So when I look at the near term objectives for our desire to improve the ramp rate, I look at that floor moving from 32 airplanes to 42 airplanes on the conservative side, and our sense that if we can do better we'd like to go to 48, 48 resides within the range of effective production capability that the line possess now in accordance with the manufacturing review team’s assessment. What they also look at is that think about 5 year to 10 year out how do you get to higher rates of production and we're working on those initiatives along with the government.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Strauss - UBS.
David Strauss - UBS:  Constellation is in the newest lot, potentially the rumor is out there that potentially the administration could look to cancel Constellation with the budget on Monday. Could you talk about the exposure there and your take on the way forward?
Robert Stevens: I can but I will say here again because the budget is coming out Monday, we don’t have complete level of visibility here as certainly you would like us to have and that quite frankly we'd like to have. We obviously break project constellation down into its component pieces. The spacecraft component, which is our responsibility and the launch vehicle segment of the program, which is not our responsibility. On the Orion program which has to do with the spacecraft, we are doing well, I mean we are executing a program plan, we are accelerating the design, we are testing components and configurations of that design. We know that on the spacecraft side, we've incorporated the flexibility in the spacecraft for, let me say, a broader range of missions. And by that I mean the spacecraft is configured to be very effective for transit to lower orbit as well as in a slightly different configuration being able to complete a lunar mission and even with more adaptations being sufficiently flexible to look at a beyond lunar mission say to Mars. But those are all based on aspirational goals. So, if in the ensuing dialogue that you and we and others are looking forward to as to how will the vision for human space flight be altered, if it’s to be altered, and if that vision were to contract the profile of human space flight moving back from Mars to the Moon or pushing the lunar mission off in time, this spacecraft we're working on still has the flexibility to meet the responsibilities of the lower orbit mission. So in our human space flight portfolio, of course, we focus on flying off the shuttle, which we are doing, and we’re just head down and focused on assuring we’re meeting the criteria associated with the spacecraft segment. And when we know more again, we’ll be able to update you without any delay, and I guess the only other thing I would add is, there was a panel that was commissioned by the administration to look at the human space flight area. They have made some recommendations, but those recommendations have not been incorporated into a new vision or new program plan and I presume that’s part of what the ongoing process is now.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company:  Quick one on the F-35, you said you would be willing to sign a fixed price contract for Lot 5. I believe that negotiation is this summer and I guess you said that would depend on whether the design was sufficiently firm and well documented, I mean it sounds like you are going to sign - you are under pressure to sign a fixed price document and you are likely to do so. What are the terms that you view as kind of critical for Lockheed Martin shareholders i.e. the type of sealing and share pattern you would be looking for in that kind of a contract?
Robert Stevens:  Well, let met just clarify, Cai , it wouldn’t be negotiated this summer. It would be a year away from this summer.  We were anticipating a fixed price incentive contract and I know your comments included that but I wanted to be clear for everybody. It's not for fixed price. It would be a year out. I don’t want to commence the negotiations with you now on the telephone about points of total assumptions and share lines. We are very facile and familiar with the characteristics of fixed price incentive contracting methodology. But part of that share line in direct answer to your question, is part of these terms and conditions, features will be exactly based on how much we do know. Did we achieve requirement stability? Did we make the progress that we thought we made? When you think of us trying to align the risk profile that we'll undertake with shareholder interest, so I would submit to you that we made those decisions before, we've been asked to take a fixed price contract once upon a time, earlier on in the Littoral Combat Ship program, we did not. We felt we could not even though that was a great desire on our part, quite obviously to get alignment with the customer on a critical mission area that we know today is critical and we believe them to be critical. We could not find the pathway to meet an expectation about a contract type given the nature of the uncertainty that we proceed in that business. That’s the standard that we are going to maintain. But I assure you Cai, we are not being “pressured” to go do anything. There is a discussion that encourages the government and the industry to work hard on securing the conditions around fixed with -- around when fixed price contracts can be used sooner rather than later. But that is not a mandatory, you must do this, and I think quite honestly, I know I don’t speak for everyone in the industry, but having come off a year in 2009 when I was Chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, the general sentiment of the members that I think is very well understood by the leaders in the Pentagon and the administration is that it is unwise to pay contracts of a fixed price nature before the environment warrants that. And I would submit to you that fixed price contract in words [ph] the key to program success, I guess we would conclude that the A400M is the most successful airplane program in development today. I for one cannot make that conclusion. So we will be very prudent. We will keep our risk profile aligned with that of our shareholders and we will certainly do all we can do to work with our government customers to secure the conditions around which fixed price contracting makes sense.
Operator: Your next question comes from Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
Troy Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company: You talked about the software on the F-35 being 80% developed. When do you expect that to be 100% and is that kind of a critical milestone that would allow you to feel more comfortable about the program.
Robert Stevens: Well there is developing the software, Troy, and then there is integrating and testing the software and software development is going to be a process that unfolds over the next years. We are on track today. In other words, when you lay out these long term plans that were put in place years ago and we projected expectations if these things are done, we'd be about in this point, we are in that zone, but I will tell you again, software development, the integration of the software, the full integration of all the vision systems on the aircraft is a key focus area for us. It has been a key focus area on every program not just our airplane program portfolio, but every program, and I would tell you honestly it's a key area in the business of every company that does this. We recognize it, the government recognizes it, and that’s why in the development phase of this program, we’re talking about putting more software development resources in place to simply assure that if we are running a software load test - and there were features that were found in that load that required a quick turn around of, what are called trouble reports and so forth, we would be able to do that in an expeditious fashion that we would have a system integration lab that would have the capacity in parallel to do multiple tests, because we all know our goal is to accelerate the pace of the program. When you accelerate the pace of the program, you need some resources and infrastructure in place to do that. So I think it's very smart for us to talk more about software development.
Bruce Tanner: Troy, I'll just add a little bit to that. The software is going to essentially track somewhat to the flight test program. And if you think of the incremental capabilities that the flight test program will open up in terms of the envelope of the aircraft, you will see software requirements similarly following that trend.

Operator:
 : 
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities:  I guess this is a question for Bruce, you already talked about margin on Joint Strike Fighter, but perhaps you can talk about any changes perhaps in your assumptions in 2010 for top line on JSF and thence the rest of the major programs in the aeronautics.
Bruce Tanner: If I look at the F-35 in 2010, I don’t see a change, I still think we’ve talked about probably some 25% growth year-over-year from 2009 to 2010, think of that in the billion-dollar range. I think that’s where we are going to run, nothing has changed us from that perspective.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Are you closer to $5 billion there or $6 billion?
Bruce Tanner: Think of it, mid 5s level. I will say the one thing that I would like to point out just, maybe I’ll just go around the business areas here but let’s talk about 2010 facing and maybe first quarter specifically because I think it’s important that we do talk that. We are probably going to see a slower ramp to the year in terms of both sales and earnings than maybe our history would suggest and there are several reasons for that and really they hit each of the business areas.
.: So you should think of that as, the back half of the year being much more heavily loaded with C-130s than the first half and when I say much more heavily I’m talking 25% of the deliveries in the first half of the year, maybe 30% and 70% to 75% deliveries in the second half, and again that's just a phenomena, the first time buyers and the special packages that are going on these particular aircraft. If I look at space, I think earnings there are also going to be back loaded, particularly due to the equity earnings on the ULA, United Launch Alliance, United Space Alliance, joint ventures. I expect to have a very large fourth quarter from an earnings perspective primarily associated with the United Space Alliance operation and as the shuttle operations come to a close at the end of 2010. So fourth quarter is going to be an earnings spike compare to the rest of the year in space. Electronic system, if I just compare that to the first half of 2009, the first half of 2009 has the presidential helicopter in it, and we don't have that obviously in 2010. So we're going to have a slower compare to the first half of 2010 for that event. If you just take a look at the 2000 plan in general, I think there are more deliveries or program events in the second half than in the first half of the year. And then if I go to IS&GS, it's somewhat similar to the other business areas in that they are probably more back end loaded in the second half than there's in the first half.
 : So that first quarter, we think is going to be a little lighter than the rest of the year. And overall, just looking at the bottom line of the first quarter and comparing that to what you might expect versus a comparison in 2009, I think we are going to see sales growth in the 1, 2% range compared to last year, I think it’s going to be the lowest margin quarter for the year, probably somewhere in the mid 10s could be my outlook as I sit here today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo: You talked about your use of cash and I guess I'm just thinking about, you raised all the debt in the fourth quarter, debt to cap is now 29%. Can you just talk about what is your ideal capital structure and what are you going to do with that cash to offset the $75 million in interest. And then Bruce, just if - I'm assuming some of that is going to the pension plan but can you just talk about, assumptions don’t change, what does that FAS/CAS look like into 2011 versus 2010 right now.
Bruce Tanner:  Look, as far as the optimal capital structure, there is – frankly, we looked at that and we try to be, I will say opportunistic and we really look at the debt when it is opportunistic and needed. So I don’t think we have a per se perfect capital structure. I'll say if you do any kind of analysis from a weighted average cost of capital and the like , we are not quite to that point yet and yet we're fine with that because that - we think that gives us some fire power if we need it going forward. As far as the FAS/CAS and the pension impact, I took a look at that just recently, remind the folks on the call, we had a 20% return on assets in 2009, so much better performance than we did in previous years obviously particularly 2008. We also have the slight down tick in the discount rate. We’re much more sensitive to the discount rate than we are at the asset return. But if you just take our performance at the end of 2009 and you assume going forward similar levels of asset returns as we promised in the past, the 8.5% return, and we hold the discount rates flat at the current five and seven eighths, I think I said on the third quarter call that we probably see a fairly significant FAS/CAS increase compared to 2010. It’s still fairly significant, but it’s lower than it was and you might think of it in kind of the couple of $100 million higher than the FAS/CAS impact in 2010, and you didn’t ask it, but I’ll throw out 2012 as well since I mentioned that on the third quarter call as well. 2012 kind of current course and speed again 8.5% discount rate, or excuse me, 8.5% return on assets and flat discount rate would actually turn break even or actually a slight income item for us in 2012.
Operator:  Your next question is from Brian Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan. 
Brian Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan:  You talked a little about weighting of revenue and earnings, it’s going to be light in the first quarter. Is it going to ramp from there gradually, are there going to be any dips or swells and then can you repeat the 2011 pension adjustment again?
Bruce Tanner:  I think we are going to see ramp quarter over quarter as we go throughout the year 2010 and obviously we tend to have strong fourth quarters. I think this fourth quarter will be very strong compared to history, but think of it as sequential growth quarter-over-quarter and where most of the growth year-over-year comparison-wise will actually occur in the fourth quarter.
Brian Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan: And sequential growth will also be sequential growth in terms of margins too, the margins should go up sequentially?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, I would think so. Again though, because of the space event, I think we are going to have a somewhat out of the ordinary spike in our fourth quarter margins, because of that. And you asked about 2011, is that right?
Brian Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan: Yes, just if you could repeat the pension adjustment?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, we are sitting at the -- as we look at 2010, had about $440 million FAS/CAS drag. That number likely grows to, think about kind of a couple hundred million dollars higher than that, so maybe the 640, 650 number, and then as I said earlier, again the 2012 actually reverses itself completely to break-even or maybe even a little tailwind, if you will.
Operator: Your next question comes from Itay Michaeli – Citi. 
Itay Michaeli - Citi: On the Q3 call, you also touched upon 2011 and 2012 revenue and margin guidance or an outlook, granted there is a lot of issues yet to be negotiated in the program. So can you maybe just touch upon how you are feeling about the mid-to-high 10% margin outlook for '11, '12 and sort of 5% plus revenue growth in those two years as well?
Bruce Tanner: Everything we see right now still says, that is what we are tracking to. We still think we are going to grow faster in the years 2011 and 2012 than we are showing bottom line growth from a sales perspective in 2009. We still think the margins are about right, I mean obviously we are all going to get some information next week when the QDR comes out, the FY11 budget comes out and somewhere down the road the five-year defense plan comes out. But everything we’ve seen, heard, rumored, et cetera, we still think that our product base going forward is well supported in the out years. We think most of the transition for us occurs in the 2010 timeframe, that’s what we are experiencing this year and then beyond that we think we are well supported .
Operator: And Mr. Kircher at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you, sir, for any closing comments.
Robert Stevens: First, let me thank everybody on the call today for hanging in. I know we went a little longer to 90 minutes, but we appreciate you being on the call today. Bo, let me thank you for your help, and if we don’t get a chance to talk to you before then, Bruce, and Jerry and I look forward to talking to you on the next quarter. Be well and we hope to see you soon.
Operator: And again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for joining us and wish you all a great day.

Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Corporation third quarter 2009 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you, Elizabeth, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Please also note that we have posted charts on our website today which supplement our comments. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bruce to provide a closer examination of our third quarter results and financial outlook, followed then by Bob with his perspectives on the corporation.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. I hope you all had an opportunity to read today's earnings release with our third quarter results, updated 2009 guidance and initial 2010 guidance. As the release outlined, 2009 performance continued at a solid level with numerous operational and financial highlights achieved through continued focus on quality and execution. Financial highlights included our Aeronautics business continuing its upward revenue growth, Electronic Systems continuing its margin generation above 13%, and the Corporation generating near record third quarter cash from operations in excess of $1.4 billion. This performance solidly positions us to achieve our increased 2009 earnings per share and return on invested capital projections. Turning to our third quarter results; the Corporation achieved solid financial performance, completed significant operational milestones, and won key new business awards. Sales growth consistent with our expectations and strong cash generation were noteworthy achievements in the quarter. With third quarter activities generating robust cash from operations, we were able to continue implementation of our cash deployment strategy for generation of shareholder value. During the quarter, we continued to repurchase our stock, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase total to over 18 million shares. In September, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authority for an additional 20 million shares, increasing the total remaining authority to approximately 35 million shares at the end of the third quarter. Our strong cash flow performance also enabled us to increase our quarterly dividend rate by 10.5%, extending our double-digit dividend rate increase to seven consecutive years. Let me now turn to a review of key events and performance in our business areas. Starting with Aeronautics, our team continued to achieve operational milestones across their programs while winning new business awards. On our largest program, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we continue to retire risks from a development program. The conventional and short takeoff and vertical landing aircraft are flying and continue to achieve objectives of the flight test program, with a 123 test flights completed to-date. In demonstration of the exceptional design maturity of the aircraft, 80% of the jets have returned from their test sorties, Code 1, with no issues and are ready to fly again. The carrier version aircraft was rolled out in July at the formal unveiling ceremony with the US Navy, and is moving forward through development towards first flight. In addition to the ongoing progress on the three aircraft variants, integration and verification of the mission systems suite continues on a Cooperative Avionics Test Bed. Other F-35 milestones successfully completed this summer included the first aerial refueling test and software development on schedule with more than 70% complete. Our C-130J remains on track to ramp up production this year to 16 aircraft deliveries and continues to attract new customers through its position as the most proven and cost effective airlifter of choice. New international aircraft awards this quarter included an additional order from Iraq for two aircraft and FMS authorization to provide eight aircraft to Kuwait. With proven performance, value, and versatility we believe future new business prospects remain bright for the C-130J and will result in higher production levels in the future. Turning to Electronic Systems; a critical program milestone was accomplished this quarter with the commencement of construction of our second Littoral Combat Ship, the USS Fort Worth. The laying of the keel marks the start of the module erection process and reflects the ship coming to life. The Littoral Combat Ship is the most cost effective ship the US Navy has ever produced, requiring only a 40 person crew that can flight in the blue water and in the Littoral environment with unprecedented situational awareness. It can cover a wide range of operational requirements from anti-piracy to search and rescue to support a special forces through utilization of modular mission packages. We are excited to build upon the lessons learned and success of our previously delivered ship, the USS Freedom as we work to provide our Navy customer these revolutionary naval vessels and help satisfy the 55 ship fleet requirements. Moving to our Space Systems business; significant operational successes were achieved this quarter for domestic and international customers. Domestic successes included the deployment and on-orbit operation of the PAN next generation satellite for our government customer. This program consists of a novel and robust turnkey commercial-based satellite, ground and launch system to meet the government's future needs. This deployment demonstrated the delivery of a high quality, low cost solution with reduced cycle times for our customer. As noted in our press release, operational success was also achieved for our international customers this quarter through the successful delivery and deployment of the JCSAT-12 satellite for commercial communications provider in Japan. This delivery marks the deployment of our 38th A2100 spacecraft to international and domestic customers. Finally, in Space, we were pleased that the Government Accountability Office dismissed a competitor's protest of our GOES-R satellite system award received earlier this year from NASA. This resolution allows our team to move forward with work on this program to construct two satellites with options for two more spacecraft. Moving to Information Systems and Global Services; financial results this quarter were mixed. Operating segment margin was consistent with our expectations and remains on track to achieve the 8.5% full year projections outlined in our July conference call. Sales growth was limited this quarter, and continues to be constrained due to delays in new business awards, customer funding, and protest resolutions. Despite these constraints, IS&GS was able to book over $3 billion in new orders this quarter, and we expect strong sales performance next quarter and mid single-digit revenue growth next year. In the area of new business, IS&GS won new awards ranging from providing engineering and technical services support to the US Air Force to secure information sharing system work for the US Navy. The largest award in the quarter was a seven-year contract from the Environmental Protection Agency for its information technology solutions agreement. This $955 million contract will fund IT work to identify environmental danger zones, climate change modeling, and geographic information systems database management. These highlights across all our business areas demonstrate our continuing operational execution and strong win rates, as we work to deliver increased value to customers and shareholders. Turning to a review of our financial outlook; I would like to start by reminding everyone that we provided a detailed overview of 2010 expectations, in both our press release and webcast presentation. I would now like to spend some time discussing our longer-term views on expected pension plan impacts, cash from operations, top-line growth, and segment operating margins. As you saw in today's press release, we intend to make at least a $1 billion discretionary contribution to our pension trust during the fourth quarter of 2009, an additional contribution of approximately $1.4 billion during 2010. Our web cast presentation includes a tabular display of our projected annual pension funding and recovery values. For planning purposes, we are assuming that Pension Protection Act funding requirements and related cash harmonization will be effective in 2011. Based on our best judgment as to what the final harmonization approach will entail, we project that our PPA funding requirements will be higher than the pension costs we will be able to recover under cash rules for at least the next several years. However, we still expect that cash from operations in those years will be comparable to or better than the 2009 to 2010 levels. The impact of the FAS/CAS adjustment on our 2010 income statement is also displayed in our webcast presentation. Rather than speculating today about where discount rates and actual returns will be at year-end, our earnings release includes sensitivity values for these variables to assist you in your modeling. Looking ahead, if we had discount rates and actual return assumptions consistent with those used in our 2010 forecast, we would expect the FAS/CAS adjustment to deteriorate in 2011 and improve significantly in 2012. I hope this discussion has provided some macro level insight into our future pension-related projections. We will obviously update our outlook and provide you final 2010 values during our January earnings call. Turning now to out-year revenue projections, we expect growth in excess of 5%, in both 2011 and 2012, led by strong expansion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Growth in this program will also tend to put downward pressure on consolidated segment operating margins during this period. However, we still anticipate our margin will remain in the mid to upper 10% range. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. He will provide his perspective on the global environment and how our diverse portfolio of programs and capabilities has us well positioned to succeed in this environment.
Bob Stevens: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for joining us on the call today. Four years ago, we were very direct in communicating to you our strategy to become the world's premiere global security company. This strategy was based on the central premise that the world's security environment represents an expanding portfolio of demands that will not recede, but only grow in number and complexity, at a time when the velocity of change around each one of us is accelerating daily. Examples reinforcing this premise are now many. Concerns over conventional military threats remain. The development of nuclear materials and the testing of ballistic missiles continue to accelerate. Acts of piracy and terrorism are on the rise and coordinated cyber attacks are increasing in scale and consequence. Governments around the world are straining to cover a broader horizon, as the very definition of security for their citizens expands from missions that are familiar, like assuring national sovereignty through the maintenance of combat capabilities or participating in humanitarian, peacekeeping, and stability operations, or delivering more efficient and effective government services, to missions that are now new and evolving, like better planning for responses to natural disasters or pandemics, like the H1N1 virus, more effective use of the energy we have and access to new forms of reliable affordable, renewable resources, the building and maintenance of critical infrastructure now importantly to include information networks and databases, and determining the best way to assure high quality affordable healthcare for families. Our strategic approach to meeting these growing demands has been to refine a disciplined growth portfolio model built on three principle actions, making start internal investments and leveraging our broad corporate experience to stimulate organic growth, forming high quality global partnerships that can advance the cost effective, best performing solutions for our customers, and selectively pursuing targeted acquisitions that directly add to our competencies and capabilities. I believe this model is sound and continues to be effective in enabling us to build our core business portfolio to advance into adjacent markets and to explore horizon market opportunities. Now today as we see evidence of mounting economic pressure, we know our customers must, out of necessity, fundamentally reevaluate their priorities and examine how they spend money to meet expanding needs with limited resources. This reevaluation has created a considerable amount of uncertainty across the industry, as to which programs would be continued and which would not, particularly with the transition to a new administration. Our job is to listen to our customers, make the adaptations that are necessary to position our company for future growth, and to deliver consistently on the commitments that we make. Our largest customer, the Department of Defense, recently announced the results of their reevaluation of priorities that has had several effects. It has added more clarity and certainty to our planning horizon. It has created some near-term challenges, as we must rebalance our portfolio to address program discontinuities and it’s also offered significant longer-term opportunities for our company. Let me take a moment and describe these impacts, starting with the near-term challenges. I think you all know that in our long-term planning, we were anticipating delivering at least 243 F-22 Raptor aircraft, based on United States Air Force statements of need that were consistent over a long period of time and historical congressional support. This environment has changed. Even as we sit here today, we are beginning to see the impact of the program winding down, as we discontinue production of the F-22 in early 2012 after delivering 187 aircraft. We were also not only planning on following through with the delivery of 23 VH-71 helicopters for the presidential mission, but felt confident that we had excellent prospects to compete for and win a follow-on effort for 141 combat search and rescue helicopters. With a contract termination for the convenience of the government and a program cancellation, work has abruptly stopped, resulting in layoffs of our work force and those prospects are no longer possible. With a strong overall performance record in our Space Systems business, we look forward to participating in the next generation satellite communications system, known as TSAT, and we've been making excellent progress on the related ground station program already awarded to us, known as TMOS. Here again, with a cancellation and a termination for convenience, work has stopped. A similar case surrounds the termination of the Multiple Kill Vehicle, or MKV system. These customer actions have resulted in a loss of revenue and profitability that cannot be made up in the near term. As you might expect, we find these circumstances to be very disappointing, but other customer reprioritization actions offer significant future opportunities. The administration's strong support for acquiring more than 2,400 Joint Strike Fighters and its commitment to maintain the near-term ramp rate, which enjoys congressional support, solidly anchors the F-35. International interest remains strong among partner countries, with quantities now projected to be about 750 aircraft, and with FMS potential, that quantity will very likely grow. The C-130J airlifter enjoys strong domestic and international support, as it delivers great service at a competitive price, and the global demand for this airplane has enabled us to increase our production rate from 12 airplanes in 2008 to 16 in 2009 to projected deliveries of 26 aircraft in 2010. The recent United States Air Force $827 million contract action for 11 aircraft is reflective of this support. Continuing customer support for aircraft programs is also evident in the recent notifications to Congress of Egypt's desire to purchase up to 24 new F-16 fighters to modernize its aging Air Force and enhance its interoperability with the United States. This award will further extend the F-16 production line beyond 2012, as we compete for a 126 aircraft opportunity in India. With the new acquisition strategy on the Littoral Combat Ship and the performance of our first ship, the United States Freedom, we are looking forward to the down-select decision in 2010 and the prospects of increasing production throughput on a program that also enjoys international interest. We find the United States Navy's recent decision to deploy Freedom two years ahead of schedule to be very gratifying and a clear expression of value and the need for this ship. Our missile defense programs PAC-3, [FAD], and Aegis, are delivering great value and performance to customers, and given the proliferation of threats, I believe demand for those systems will remain strong over time. You will note that the Aegis system plays prominently in the administration's recent evolution of the European missile defense strategy. I have a similar view of the potential for future space systems, including additional classified and unclassified satellites. Opportunities for long-term growth are represented by the potential for our customer to expand Advanced EHF satellite work from three satellites to six and to expand our work on the GPS III system from two satellites currently under contract to as many as 32 over the next decade. In the information technology area; I see potential growth of federal IT and other government agencies outside DoD, as new policy implementations are enacted, that will require new systems solutions to be performed by our IS&GS segments. I look forward to IS&GS expanding their role as the number one provider of information technology services to the federal government, a distinction that has been earned over the last 15 consecutive years. There is also potential in adjacent and in horizon markets. We are currently participating in the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle competition and look forward to the selection of a winning design after completion of the vehicle evaluation phase. We are also working with our customers to improve logistics and supply chain management, determining how to use energy resources more wisely and addressing the growing concern about cyber security.  So despite the near-term challenges associated with portfolio rebalancing, I remain very optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for our corporation. A key to our realizing this great potential lies in our ability to consistently execute with excellence. As we listen to our customers, and to the congressional leaders who oversee our industry, they clearly recognize that the global security environment is getting more complicated, while fiscal resources are becoming more constrained. As their partners, we need to improve our focus and step up our game. To that end, I reestablish the position of President and Chief Operating Officer, and ask Chris Kubasik to serve in that capacity effective January 1, 2010. Many of you already know Chris from his service as our Chief Financial Officer for seven years, and, for the past two years, as Executive Vice President of our largest and one of our most complex business area, Electronic Systems. In his 10 years with Lockheed Martin, Chris has demonstrated an ability to build effective relationships with all of our constituencies, both inside and outside our company, establish a clear vision and set expectations and get results. Those of you who have followed Lockheed Martin know that Chris and I work very well together. I am confident that his oversight of the operations of our business areas and the execution of more than 3,000 programs our customers have entrusted to us will reinforce Lockheed Martin's position as the go-to team for the most difficult global security challenges. Additionally, as we deal with our near-term portfolio rebalancing, I have spoken to our leaders about longer-term goals. We will look for efficiencies in all that we do ways to reduce costs and shorten cycle times, while improving quality and predict ability for our customers. While Bruce has already outlined our revenue growth for the next couple of years, as I look out further, I expect to see revenue growth greater than the rate of growth in the defense budget, probably in the mid single digit or slightly greater range, and I expect international interest in our programs to remain strong. I believe that margin expansion will prove difficult, as backlog realigns from higher to lower margin work, but as sales grow, I expect segment operating profit to grow as well. I believe future margin expansion opportunities will exist, as more of our backlog flows from maturing domestic and international production programs. We will continue to focus on and incentivize cash generation and return on invested capital, as significant measures of value creation. Careful cash allocation will include assuring smart internal investments, competitive dividends, opportunistic share repurchases, appropriate funding of our pension plans, and acquisitions that meet our tests for value and fit. So in summary, we have a sound strategy, great technology, and a highly motivated and committed work force. We will grow the top line over the next several years and see economic EPS growth, while continuing our cash generation. Pensions will remain a headwind for EPS and cash, and we will focus on performance and execution in all that we do. Elizabeth, Bruce and Jerry and I would like to you open the lines now and let's take the first question, please.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from George Shapiro with Access 342.
George Shapiro - Access 342: Bruce, I would like you to go through in the projection for aeronautics margin? I mean you got it down in the low 11s and this year is probably going to be 12, 9, give or take a little bit. It almost seems to me that to get the margin that low, you must have been making 20% margins or so on the F-22 program, which was a lot higher than I thought or let me turn it over to you to get further explanation.
Bruce Tanner: Let me say by introduction, there is going to be a lot of moving pieces here. So, I am going to walk you through this kind of slowly if I could. Starting with sales, the sales, we are expected to be pretty strong next year, 7 to 9% in the range that we provided to you in the guidance. Think of that as greater than 25% growth year-over-year on the F-35 program, in excess of $1.2 billion growth from 2009 to 2010. The F-22, because of the drawdown that the production program in 2012 are already starting to see some early indications of that, and so F-22 volume is probably down nearly $400 million from 2009 to 2010. F16, aircraft quantities are going from 31 in 2009 to 20 in 2010. Think of that being in excess of $500 million or so of sales, and think of those sales coming from aircraft that are the highest margin aircraft in our portfolio within the Aeronautics business area. Then lastly, the C-130, we're actually growing the aircraft there, obviously, as Bob mentioned in his remarks from 16 to 26. Think of that as adding about $600 million on the C-130 program. So if you take a look at the EBIT side of that, just again to tie this together, EBIT does show us going down, think of EBIT, I think at the midpoint, it is like in the 11.2% range, from a ROSS perspective, probably down over 1.5, 1.6 percentage points compared to what we expect to run in 2009. The contributors there again, think of the F-35, although the absolute EBIT dollars on the F-35 are up about 60%. Think of that as driven by the sales growth but also planned improvements on the margins, on that program. Think of it being a little less than 5 in the 2009 timeframe to a little more than 6% on average for the year 2010. F-22 EBIT is just going to follow the sales and very similar ROSS is to what we experienced in 2009. F-16 EBIT for the most part follows sales also, although the ROSS is obviously slightly down, primarily because of the mix, or exclusively because of the mix of the aircraft from 2009 to 2010. The C-130 EBIT also follows sales, ROSS down slightly again because of the mix of aircraft in 2010 compared to 2009. So kind of from an overall big picture viewpoint, think of the F-35 being about a little less than 35% or so of the total sales of Aeronautics business area, growing to where it is now almost 45% of the Aeronautics portfolio. The rest of the portfolio, if I was just to take a look at the ROSS in both those years, they average in about the mid-teens. So, there is not a change from a profitability perspective in total from the rest of the portfolio. I kind of characterize this as JSF algebra, just because of the greater contribution at a lower margin level.
George Shapiro - Access 342: It still seems though, Bruce, that the margin on the F-22 must have been higher than what I thought, because I kind of factored in the growth in the F-35 and the potential margin increases that you alluded to and I don't get the margin down much, versus what your guidance. So I mean is there something I'm missing there? I can just go back and redo the numbers and maybe I'm missing something.
Bruce Tanner: I don't think I've got a different explanation than what I gave to you, George. I mean the F-22 has had some step-ups for risk retirements in 2009, but again as I look at it going forward into 2010, I expect a fairly similar level from a ROSS perspective, still strong, but not the drop-off that you're thinking out there.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research: I wanted to just ask you first on a couple of aeronautics programs, so on the F-16, okay, you're taking the rates down, but in deference to Bob's comment, I also noticed that you're anticipating the Egyptian sale of the F-16s and I noticed that on the FMS has notified Congress of the sale to Egypt. So, I was wondering if you could tell me just what’s going to happen with the F-16 rates. Should we anticipate that you're going to continue to decline or does it come back? I mean what happens to the production rates?
Bruce Tanner: We're going to hold fairly consistently. I think at the 20, 21 aircraft level in 2010 and 2011. As we look out, say in the 2012 timeframe, we see at least a doubling probably of that build rate to somewhere in the 40s range of F-16s. Think of that as mostly aircraft that are already in the backlog, the Turkish aircraft, I think it is the Moroccan aircraft and we would likely expect some of the Egyptian aircraft to take place in the calendar year 2012 as well. So, fairly steady production and then a pretty good sized spike expected in 2012 and beyond that it's kind of dependent upon what happens with the.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research: Indian.
Bruce Tanner: The Indian competition and some of the smaller competitions we're pursuing.
Richard Safran - Buckingham Research: Then on a program you don't do a lot of talking about the C-5 modernization. First thing, am I right, you delivered three development airplanes; I think you have a contract for 49 to 50. When do you start delivering the non-development airplanes and also can you tell me what we should look for the ramp rate for that program?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah. Happy to do so. We don't talk about that program a whole lot and but it's a very exciting program. I hope you saw in the quarter that one of the three aircrafts we delivered into the test program was taken by the Air Force and broke some 41 at least their pending records, for, think of this as payload, range and getting to altitude as certain climb rates, if you will. This is after we've done the re-engineering and the modernization of the aircraft, so we're very pleased with the performance of the aircraft first off. You're also right. We are under contract for the early lots of what's envisioned right now to be a 49 aircraft modernization program think of this as the B models and the C models, out of the fleet of C-5s. Again, a total of 49 aircraft, you should think of that being at the end of the day in excess of $5 billion worth of business for those C-5 aircraft. The build rate, I think we have our first delivery in 2010 and that's followed I believe in 2011 with three aircraft and then five, seven, it kind of peaks in a few years out there, beyond that at about 11 per year, Rich.
Bob Stevens: I just want to add a note to Bruce's comment because I think you've highlighted in your question a point we don't often cover because we talk so frequently about F-22, F-35, C-130 now C-5, we haven't really talked about the F-16. We have a highly focused program and international team here and when we talk about future opportunities. We don't think we see at present the end of the F-16 line at all and there are in fact opportunities. The biggest thing is you've already cited the 126 airplanes in India, but there are government-to-government discussions today about the prospect of airplanes in Iraq. We find replacement cycle airplanes coming up from time-to-time that could certainly be the case in Greece. Maybe Expressions of Interest from countries in the Middle-East like Qatar and Oman and others. So, the horizon for the F-16 program, even though we're going to see a build down in the quantities as Bruce has described them to you, in our judgment is one that still has real potential and possibilities and one that we're going to work hard to focus and concentrate on again even though it gets crowded out a little bit in the discussion about other aircraft programs.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
Joe Nadol - JPMorgan: Bruce, it might be helpful just diving down into the F-35 and thanks for all the detail you gave us on the segment overall, the aeronautics segment overall. But you expect margins to get to over 6% in 2010. LRIP, I would imagine your opportunity there is considerably higher than that and that's becoming a much, much bigger part of the pie, of the F-35 pie. So, could you maybe outline the opportunities to that sort of rate, both in 2010 and as you think out a couple more years?
Bruce Tanner: We look at the F-35, the EMD contract is on the winding down phase. I think we probably peaked in volume on the program, probably in the 2007 timeframe, if I'm not mistaken. So, we're a little bit on the backend side of that program if you will. We had some step-ups on the contract in 2008, that's what allowed us to get to the 5% I referenced earlier. We have some planned adjustments, already included in our guidance for 2010, as well. Upside beyond that depends on how successful the flight test program is in 2010, and our outlook for beyond that period of time, because that's really the crux of what the remaining work is on the EMD contract. You're absolutely right, that the LRIP volume is starting to overtake the lower initial production volume is starting to overtake the EMD volume. We would expect those contracts to be more profitable than the EMD contract. Given we haven't yet delivered an aircraft out of LRIP, you might expect that we would be typically a little more conservative with our starting booking rate adjustments on those contracts. At the end of the day, we do think that they are going to be more profitable than the EMD contract, and not, you should think of the model, you should probably think of as not a whole lot different than if you look at the F-22 program and it’s early phases of aircraft delivery and how we stepped up the booking rates ultimately to get to where we are today on that program, it’s a very similar model to what we expect to happen on the F-35.
Joe Nadol - JPMorgan: That's a good model, because you had a very, very quick step-up on F-22, over a two or three-year period after a long time at kind of a flattish mid single-digit level, if I remember correctly. So is there, just to put you on the spot a little bit, do you think you can identify a year where you're targeting 10% for the program?
Bruce Tanner: Overall, for the program or?
Joe Nadol - JPMorgan: The F-35 program overall?
Bruce Tanner: I'm not sure I want to target that, but take any particular year, Joe. I would say that is clearly our expectation, and our expectation is that we will do greater than that. Very similar to what we did on the F-16, on the F-22 and the C-130s once they get into production. I think we will likely hit the 10% level, likely before we get into the forward production level, which look about the 2015 timeframe, if that helps.
Operator: We will take our next question from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: On IS&GS, this was a unit that you all have looked at as growing at a 10% rate this year, 10% type of a rate top line next year. Now, if I look at your Q2 guidance and if I then take that, we're only looking at about a 4% top-line growth in the next year. What's happening here? Are you seeing significant changes in the markets for IS&GS?
Bruce Tanner: Doug, I will take a shot at that. I think if you look at the range we've given you, we were in the 4% to 6% range which is definitely lower than what we've out looked before. I see a couple things going on there and first let me give you a little bit of color on the individual lines of business that we see there. It might surprise you somewhat to learn that our defense line of business there, we actually expect to have kind of high single-digit growth, within our civil line of business, think of that as kind of the mid single-digit level, and think of our intelligence line of business as being in the low single-digit growth. So it's not a uniform level of growth across the three business areas or across the three lines of business. I'll say we probably, given the experience that we had in 2009 with a number of the protests, a number of the delays, a number of the program start-ups and funding concerns that occurred, we probably recognize that fact, and probably turned that into our outlook for 2010 as well. So for instance, we saw the bigger things that impacted us. The TMOS cancelation was in IS&GS. So while there were some sales activities in 2009, again, as Bob mentioned in his remarks, that burden was terminated, so there is nothing in 2010 for that. A couple of the larger contracts, I mentioned in the second quarter, the [FASTeR] contract, and the fact that that was planned, actually the 2009 start, today it is a 2010 competition, with a date uncertain as to when that will take place. So we have taken what you would probably assume to be the appropriate action resulting from that. Some of our larger contracts, some of the IDIQ contracts approximately we're expecting to have in 2009 have just come into fruition. For instance, the GSA Fame contract and the AFRICAP contract which you may recall in 2008 was a significant contributor to our overall growth levels in 2008. That contract actually was just recently awarded for its 2009 activity, and think of this as being delayed primarily because of the administration changeover. So given that backdrop of what we've seen happened in 2009, I think we've just tried to reflect, you could call it a more conservative view but I will say a more realistic view as to what our expectations are in 2010.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: When I look at this, and then the mix shift that you're describing, then I also think about margins here. We're looking at margins in 2010 based on your guidance that are roughly the same as you're talking about for '09. These are significantly below what we've seen from this business for some time before. Can you explain why you would continue to expect that to go on?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. I think it’s a couple of things. I think one is; this is reflective of the awards that we've had a significant number of awards recently and I think this is reflective of some of the margins that are coming on those new awards. Secondly, we had I'll say a fairly aggressive approach in 2009, relative to assume, I’ll say profit adjustments and claims settlements and the like that we’re taking a little less aggressive approach in 2010 given what we experienced in 2009. I think those are the two biggest drivers of what is going on. I will remind you this is a business that we always kind of viewed as much more of an ROIC focused business, there is not much capital intensity there that has good cash terms with it, and so this is a business where somewhat lower margins than some of the more capital intensive businesses that we have is probably what we should be expecting.
Operator: As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of saving time, please limit yourself to one question, and return to the queue. We'll take our next question from Peter Arment with Broadpoint.
Peter Arment - Broadpoint: Yes. Actually you've hit upon most of my questions. I guess could you, Bruce walk us through a little bit again on aeronautics on 2010? I guess I'm a little confused. Did you say that C-130 EBIT is not going to be, you're not getting any benefit from that or did I just misinterpret that?
Bruce Tanner: No, I said, I think I said, C-130, we are seeing the 10 aircraft addition there between 2009 and 2006. I think what I said is that EBIT would likely follow the sales at proportionate levels of actually ROSS might be slightly down, primarily just because of the mix of aircraft. I mean there is not uniformity, there is not a single contract for all of the aircraft that are delivered in any given year and that mix changes from year to year. As we look at 2010 versus 2009, it's slightly lower but literally it's still something you can be very proud of, I'll say that.
Peter Arment - Broadpoint: Right. Okay. I understand. You have hit on all my other questions but and you also on your guidance, you don't assume any stock buyback, correct?
Bruce Tanner: Basically if you take a look at where we are at the end of the third quarter, I think we're at some 385 million shares and basically what we had assumed in the guidance for 2010 is kind of flat line at that level for the year.
Operator: We will take our next question from Myles Walton from Oppenheimer & Company.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company: Bruce, a question for you on the cash flow, you mentioned the 2011 picture improving versus the 2009, 2012 levels and I guess two questions here, first is what is your anticipation for burn off advances in 2010? Then what is the moving parts into 2011 that are really causing the improvement on the cash side?
Bruce Tanner: We're actually expecting in 2010 a little bit of improvement on the advances. Think of that as some of the international contracts we're getting, most likely on the C-130, as far as the FMS deals we announced previously, think of this as the Iraqi aircraft orders or the Kuwaiti aircraft orders, so that will likely bring with them some advanced payments that will likely contribute positively towards that. Inventory, we expect a little bit of turn on inventory going the other way in 2010, as we ramp up the build rate within the aeronautics portfolio. Then beyond that, we expect again strong continued cash flow from each of the four business areas. There is a little bit of tax benefit actually going into 2011 and 2012, in terms of payments that will contribute to better cash flow, but again as I said in the prepared remarks, I think we're looking even with the pension funding cash to be at least as strong as what we've seen in 2009 and 2010, if not a little stronger than that.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Company: One quick follow-up; is it fair to say that the 500 million CAS increase in the P&L is having about a 50 basis points hit on margins in 2010 versus '09?
Bruce Tanner: I looked at that FY a little differently Myles. Think of that, it’s a good question because CAS did increase fairly significantly from 2009 to 2010 probably close to about $400 million. Maybe I got my numbers a little wrong, I think it is $400 million increase, yes 580 to 990. Think of that, it's a little difficult because some of this gets spread over contracts that cross multiple periods but think of probably 20% to 25% of that CAS increase is falling to the bottom line on fixed price contracts that are in our backlog. Think of most of those fixed price contracts residing in the aeronautics business area and in the electronics systems business area, so it is kind of as we looked at the impact of that. We think overall, that's probably had a two or three tenth impact from a ROSS perspective relative to the CAS hitting on our price business on fixed price contracts. Obviously, that eventually starts to wither away as you start to price those new contracts and price that CAS impact into that. So that's a little bit of a timing issue that we expect to recover in the out years.
Operator: We will take our next question from Troy Lahr with Stifel Nicolaus.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus: Bob, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the programs that you said where challenge is VH-71, TSAT, MKV and then F-22 rolling off. I mean, do you think there are still at risk here? Or do you feel that you've already taken your lumps on most of your major programs and can you throw CEV in there as a potential [at-risk] program?
Bob Stevens: I think that it would be fair to say not only we at Lockheed Martin, but probably all the companies in the industry, recognizing two factors the change in administration and the demands in the global security environment, then separately the changes where I'll see it in the global economic environment how those economics are affecting domestic policy. We expected to see the change in priority. We just didn't know exactly where it would fall and how it would roll through our backlog and our future horizon. So in one sense, Troy, I thought we got a great level of insight, much more clarity. I don't know that I can tell you today it's 100% so, but I think it's pretty well established going into the quite [plenty] of defense review as to what program priorities have been established. I find that when we look at our backlog and our future horizon, again, some of the statements of what will be highly valued and most desired like the Secretary of Defense's comments about needing "75%" solution soon rather than a 99% elegant solution that I have to wait years for and cost a lot of money favors companies who have effective backlog, where you are executing and meeting your expectations because you can derive it in spiral development from those capabilities into a broader range of 75% solution. So I think we pretty much heard the majority of the reprioritization effect on our backlog and that’s what Bruce I think has been so thorough in trying to describe to you relative to the near-term guidance and portfolio rebalancing, and we really do look at it as rebalancing of the portfolio at this time. Now you mentioned the crew acceleration vehicle or the Orion program. We have real confidence in that program, believe we are doing a very good job in developing an adaptable system that can not only go and perform well in low-earth orbit but can satisfy mission aspirations that they go beyond low-earth orbit if it was a Lunar objective or Martian objective or beyond. So we’re doing well. I think we’ve got a tight design. You know there are studies and appraisals underway now about what the overall strategy should be and that final determination has not been made, but I believe the Orion program will demonstrate value across a variety of strategic alternatives with respect to human space flight. The one thing probably most people could agree on is that shuttle won’t fly forever and that human space flight program has value in many aspects of American lives. So we’ll probably hear more about that and we may hear some fine tuning, but I think the net reinforcements of the investments that we have made and the way we oriented the business over time far outweigh the short-term challenges of portfolio rebalancing.
Operator: We will take our next question from Itay Michaeli with Citi.
Itay Michaeli - Citi: Bruce, just wanted to get back to the 2011-2012 margin comment, I think you mentioned to think about in a mid to upper 10% range. It looks like we will be in the upper 10% range in 2010. Just wanted to ask, I mean is there anything structurally that gets us lower than that in 2011 and back up to 2012, or is that just kind of the range to think about going forward in that range? Why would it maybe be below upper 10% in 2011-2012?
Bruce Tanner: As I said in the description of the Aeronautics business area, it is most significantly driven by just the infusion and the tremendous growth rate of the F-35 program over that period of time. We've talked about in the past the fact that we thought Aeronautics could be a $20 billion a year business by 2015 and probably 75 plus percent of that coming from the F-35, that's still the case in our estimation, it’s not greater than that. So if you put any kind of compound annual growth rate on the F-35, and as I said earlier, it grows greater than 25% year-over-year in 2010. It grows at a tremendous clip, which is all goodness, frankly, but it does bring with it the margins that you would expect on the early phases of this program that’s going to last for the next 30, 40 years. So as I look forward, the pressure is going to come in here just from the growth of the F-35 program. I think Electronic Systems probably stays, fairly consistent at the 13%. Some upside potential as we see some of the international, particularly missile defense applications coming to fruition. We have some upside there. Space; space has been 11% now or higher for two consecutive years. We've got the demise of the shuttle program and with that our support contract, United Space Alliance, the USA contract in the 2011 timeframe likely that will bring with it some diminished equity earnings that we would ordinarily get from that contract, but as we sit here today, we think we have opportunities to essentially keep that margin fairly consistent with what we're doing in 2009 and 2010. Then IS&GS just for planning purposes and obviously we're going to try to have opportunity greater than that, we still think that’s going to be somewhere in the 8% to 9% range during this period of time.
Operator: We'll go next to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Guys, on the comment that the total top line can grow in mid-single digits for a couple of years beyond the end of the decade, I think it’s clear that you expect the aeronautics business to grow. Can you quantify what you think the business excluding aeronautics can grow at in the two to three years after the end of the decade?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. We still think, let’s, I will let Bob jump in here in a second, I'm sorry, but we still think aeronautics is obviously the fastest growing, it could approach, near double-digit growth rates by the 2012 timeframe year-over-year. We think electronic systems still, but for the 2010 situation, with the rebalancing the portfolio, the impacts of the presidential helicopter, and the like, we still think that’s probably in the mid-single digit level, maybe slightly lower than that, 4% to 5% level. Think of that. Space, we see some prospects of growth. We've kind of described that as a flattish business, but we're getting I'll say from some of this that Bob described the rebalancing of the portfolio. We are seeing in the not too distant future, some significant potential classified satellite activity for the US government that at some point will bring some lift to the Space business area. Maybe not in the time frames we're talking about, but we could see some significant orders in that latter timeframe that I discussed earlier. Then in the IS&GS, we still think of that as between mid to double levels of growth rate on an annual basis still outstripping the market in general and still outstripping the DoD marketplace as well.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Could you categorize what kind of investment account growth is embedded in those assumptions?
Bruce Tanner: From a DoD perspective, we think it is probably in the 2, maybe 2% to 3% range per year. I'll turn just for a little more color there.
Bob Stevens: Of course, you would appreciate we've thought a lot about what circumstances we'd be facing in the broader market relative to let me start with deficits. So the Defense Secretary has said he would really like to see a budget that has modest to real growth, and we appreciate that as a sound aspirational goal. He also said I don't want to see a lot of cuts and then a lot of reacceleration. So, think of that boom/bust cycle and certainly, we like every part of that phrase. If we can get stability in the budget over time, absenting the boom/bust cycle, I think there will still be some headwinds on the aspiration for modest 2% to 3% real growth. I think it might actually be tighter than that, and our growth estimates assume some downward pressure on that real growth. The reason we offer this growth prospect to you with confidence is we've already gone through some of the first screening on priorities and we know we have to focus on affordability and cycle time, good cost estimating and delivering what's expected on schedule, and we're working hard to strengthen those aspects of our portfolio. So, we think we've got a number of the right programs in the right place at the right time, many of which have had a really good start. So, there is a foundation underneath them and I think even with a little head wind, we should be able to sustain these growth expectations. I think the unknown for so many is as we look at deficits expanding, we need to see a restoration of GDP expansion as well. The health of the economy has to come back. We have to see the recovery, not necessarily over the next couple of quarters, but we've got to see resurgence in the economy that will generate revenues that will help liquidate the debt that the nation is assuming. If that weren't to happen over the next, say few years, then we will be having different kinds of conversations with you and others and we'll probably all having these kinds of conversations. So, there is still an uncertainty out there, but we’ve tried to look very carefully at the portfolio and the things that we have to do to consistently be evaluated and adding value to US government missionaries, even during times of increased fiscal stress.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: So I guess, just to square away the addressable market part, you've talked about Secretary Gates discussing low single digit growth in the total budget, but it sounds like you're also recognizing that given where the deficit is, given that there are other priorities, given that the economy may recover slowly, that there may be a share shift from investment towards other areas that declines in investment accounts beyond the end of the decade is certainly possible.
Bob Stevens: It is possible, and it's as a share of the total and it's possible that there will be pressure on some of the other agencies beyond the Department of Defense, but again we think we have the program portfolio that positions us well to essential government services. I would also just add that everywhere we go and I'm going to guess that for many on the call, there are some sense of this as well. The global security environment really just is not settling down. It's getting more interesting and more complicated, and it means that our government and the governments of friends and allies with whom we participate in building partner capacity, meaning they are going to need programs and they are going to need capabilities. Then you have to address more things and that's why we are putting such an increased emphasis here, redoubling our effort really on affordability, cost reduction, cycle time management for scheduled delivery and so forth. It is the right action for us to take, because we do sense that it's going to be increasingly difficult to hold a modest real growth defense budget or other budgets in this environment. So that is certainly true.
Jerry Kircher: Elizabeth, this is Jerry. While we've come up on the hour, we had some longer earlier comments here. So, I think we can extend this a little bit longer if there are still some people in the queue that want to ask some questions. So why don't we take this to 12:15, if there are some people wanting to ask questions.
Operator: We will take our next question from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: I know that I guess since the last quarterly conference call, some of the budgets have worked their way further through Congress. I'm trying to understand within your backlog, has anything additional changed in terms of any backlog that you have taken away from programs that have been canceled, because I know some of them like the VH-71 happened already, but in terms of the sequential $3 billion decline we’ve seen in the backlog?
Bob Stevens: I think you probably seen the full expression of all the reprioritization actions, as they have affected our backlog as we’ve seen them.
Bruce Tanner: I’ll jump in Sam, third quarter was light but we kind of knew it was going to be light going into it. They just wanted a lot of competitions there. We expect a much better fourth quarter that’s where lot of the follow-on contracts will be as well, some of the orders that we’ve already talked about including the C-130J for 11 aircraft that Bob mentioned in his remarks.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Then Bob, if you don’t mind me asking a follow-up question. There has been a lot of discussion about organizational conflicts of interest and that potentially causing some divestitures as some of the other contractors. Any sense within Lockheed Martin if that would cause you to have to think about changing some of the business mix?
Bob Stevens: Yes. Not as we see it today. We are certainly mindful of conflicts of interest. We run our business with great awareness as to where they exist and what mitigation strategies are available. We don’t think there, actually I must be candid with you, I think some of the conversations that I have been exposed to may give the appearance of situation more acute than the ones that we see particularly are working closely with our customers. So where it’s necessary for us to have a certain provision in place whether it’s a firewall or some other mechanism, we certainly have them and we polish them. It’s not a broad consideration across our business. We are not being asked or it’s not being suggested to us that we divest. Segments of our business, we are not planning to divest segments of our business. We are planning to rigorously adhere to all expectations of us. Not only conflict of interest but all the other expectations about propriety and the business conduct issues that we face and we want to improve our execution and performance in those areas that we do have. So I'm not anticipating it. We're not planning for it. The discussion that Bruce has led you and the other participants in the call today through today don't have that as any of our planning assumptions strategically or operationally.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Bruce, if I understand correctly, I look at your 2010 guidance and a few of the pieces there, you have not built in an R&D tax credit, which I think you said is worth about a dime or so this year?
Bruce Tanner: We have not done that, Rob, and it is something that has happened with great consistency in the past, but it is not yet passed the Congress, and just as we did last year by the way, we didn't put it in the initial guidance last year, either.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: If I think about that, and I think about the absence of the effect of a share buyback, and you've got a fairly recent authorization increase, I think about 20 million shares. Then if we were to look at pension and market, where rates and returns are today, how might that affect or at least the pension part, how might that affect the costs that you're expecting next year, if we were to mark things as of the quarter?
Bruce Tanner: Looking at the quarter, we gave you the guidance that basically said it was 8.5% for the year on the asset side, and the 6 and 8 on the discount rate. Looking at it today, we are doing much better than that, as we sit here, what's today, October 20. We're doing much better than that from an asset return perspective. The discount rate, just in the last week or so, we have seen about 20 basis points improvement there, but think of the asset return in the mid to upper teens, as we sit here today, think of the discount rate, if we were to pick it today, likely in the high fives. The kind of interesting math that goes along with that, is if, if we were to make 2010 based on those current assumptions, although they're different than the asset return and the discount rate we have in our guidance, the absolute FAS/CAS is just about the same exact number. If you walk through the sensitivity analysis that I've given to you in the press release, and use the differences that I just talked about I think you will see that that works out to be just about the same FAS/CAS.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Okay. So in a sense the intention is not really a source of conservatism in the guidance but share buybacks certainly could be as well as the R&D tax credit?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. I think R&D tax credit, I think, we obviously asked for share repurchase authority with the intention of continuing to do that, which we historically did not put in our guidance going forward, and frankly we'll see what happens. The biggest swinger obviously is the discount rate between that and the end of the year if business rates go up.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Thank you very much.
Bob Stevens: Yes. Rob, let me just add a little note on guidance because this question that you posed gets posed from time to time, and it’s not our desire to necessarily appear conservative, but I will tell you, I think we construct guidance in a fashion that’s just consistent with the way we approach all the interactions we have with our customers and on all of our programs, our customers hold a standard that say, you don't take credit for something until you earn it, until you demonstrate it. I mean it’s a very rigorous process and it’s really healthy for our business when we approach all subjects like that. So, on the R&D tax credit, it may occur, it may not occur. It has occurred in the past. What we try to do is just be absolutely transparent and clear to you about what is or is not in that guidance, but I personally rather like the standard here that says, go earn it and achieve it and demonstrate it before you record it or include it in your expectations. So, I trust that we're being sufficiently clear to you and transparent, so you all know what is and is not in the projections that we give you, but that's the philosophy around which some of these projections are formulated.
Bruce Tanner: Bob and I certainly agree. I think that is the right approach. Of course, this early in the guidance cycle but of course, from where we sit, we think about trends and what has happened before so we can consider the possibilities out there.
Operator: We will take our next question from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Yes, thank you. Could we have some more comment on the F-16 bathtub? I mean it looked like it was going at 30 a year and now it is going down to 20. I mean who are the guys who moved out? Are they Pakistan, Morocco? Is this the result of normal bureaucratic inertia? Is this the result of a change in Foreign Arms Sales policy under the Obama administration, and what's the chance that that 20 number in 2011 could be 30 or could be 10?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah Cai there is nothing magical or mystical. No one has moved forward, no one has put a step in there. This is simply playing out the backlog. I mean think of an F-16, from contract award to contract delivery taking about three years, so what we see happening in the year 2010 are awards that we received in 2007. Think of what's happening in 2011 as the awards we received in 2008 and so on. That's I won't say set in stone, but it is pretty close to that and that's just the function of what orders we had on a given year basis and three years later we will deliver those orders.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Yet, you've got potential for Egypt, you've got potential for Iraq, so those all are kind of what, 2013?
Bruce Tanner: There is a chance some of those will slide, that's what I made the comment earlier that we expect the build rate to get into the 40ish level in 2012. That's because we think some of those, we can probably slide in the later part of 2012, but the bulk of those will likely be in 2013 and beyond.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Should we think of any margin impact from going from 20 to 40? Or is that covered in the contract pricing?
Bruce Tanner: We have a customer who is a very intelligent customer who would expect when volume goes up, that they would expect to see reductions from things like overhead absorption and the like, and you wouldn't expect to get windfall profits from there, but I would expect to get similar margins going forward to what we've experienced on the F-16 behind it. These are all international sales. I wouldn't expect to see necessarily significant uptick to where we are but I wouldn't expect it to go down either going forward out that far.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: So when they go down to 20, we shouldn't expect the margins to suffer as a result of that?
Bruce Tanner: I would not.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Campbell with Barclays Capital.
Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital: Yes, good morning. I have a question for Bruce about the PPA and CAS in 2010 and ‘11. You said before that something like 25% of CAS might fall through to the bottom line and hurt earnings and the other 75 would be recovered I gather. How much is the PPA higher than CAS in 2010 and '11and why is that it goes back down? What's happening with the government changes? Is there going to be something different for the FY2011 budget? Or you know the FAS/CAS harmonization or whatever. What is happening there?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, let me give you a little background. We were unclear going into this year exactly when the CAS harmonization was effective. We were a little unclear as to when the CAS harmonization would take place. I fact, I think the final rule making has not yet been disclosed in 2010 yet, but all indications are that it will happen some time prior to the end of the year with the effectivity being January 1, 2011. I'll remind you whenever that CAS harmonization, essentially all that does is accelerate CAS expenditures or CAS recovery to more closely align with the PPA. So those will both take effect again in the 2011 timeframe. As I look at 2010, the PPA or the ERISA funding requirement is not too different purely by coincidence than the FAS numbers in 2010. Think of it about the 1.4 billion that I keyed up as the contribution in 2010, that is the PPA value in 2010 if you will, and we would expect that the CAS number will go up slightly above that in 2011 and that the PPA funding will go higher than that again, for a couple of years, until such time beyond 2012, 2013, where those two will reverse. If you recall, we gave a chart, I think it was in the second quarter, the second quarter Jerry or further than that, where we showed the FAS/CAS trend line since the beginning of Lockheed Martin's history in 1995. It says eventually these two curves between the FAS, the CAS and the ERISA they all tend to equate to the same number. While we have a little short fall in the near-term, we think that gets made up in the longer term and will be generating cash, if you will, as a result of the CAS exceeding ERISA requirements. I gave you a whole mouth full there, Joe. Hopefully, that made sense to you.
Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital: Let me just ask, do you think that the amounts that you’ll have to put in '10 and '11, that is where PPA causes to you put more in than you can get back on CAS. When you get out there, will you be able to bill the government for the amounts that you put in, but weren't at that time eligible to collect on CAS, or are those amounts gone forever?
Bruce Tanner: No, we definitely get the ability to bill it under our CAS. It is strictly the timing. Even with CAS harmonization, ERISA, which is, the PPA is the new ERISA or ERISA is the new PPA if you will. That’s accelerated even with CAS harmonization in advance of CAS, but eventually CAS catches up, no doubt.
Joe Campbell - Barclays Capital: Just so I'm straight, is the CAS going to be aligned so that it can't be lower than the minimum ERISA or is CAS going to be aligned with FAS? So that what if FAS was high, CAS will also be high so that we could expect kind of from a regulatory point of view that CAS and FAS will be the same? Or is it only that PPA which is minimum funding is going to be aligned with CAS?
Bruce Tanner: Even with PPA, you're always going to have a difference between CAS versus ERISA, which is PPA and versus FAS. Think of the FAS and the CAS, again, you're going to have different levels of amortization of gains and losses, different periods of time. I've always kind of said, the CAS, a little longer to enable. Think of the appropriators who have to fund to be able to pay for CAS, you need some time to actually get that in the appropriations in the five-year plans and the like. So, that’s typically a longer amortization or a spread period than is the FAS. ERISA is different still. It's typically more front-end loaded than is CAS for the reasons I just described, but those three will still move somewhat independently of each other.
Jerry Kircher: Elizabeth, I think I need to turn it back over to Bob for final comments as we've run over a little bit here but if I could give it back to Bob, please.
Bob Stevens: Well, let me first thank you all for tuning in on the call today. Let me also reiterate for each of you that we intend to perform at a very high operational level throughout this company. We have a strong portfolio of long-term work, rock solid balance sheet, excellent cash flows and sound credit ratings and we have an outstanding work force that knows how to meet challenges and I want to end the call today by thanking our 140,000 employees. This team has enabled Lockheed Martin to achieve operational and financial performance while providing mission critical products and services to our customers. It's through their dedication and talent that we continue to generate value to customers and to our shareholders. I do appreciate your interest in the call today, and we're all looking forward to talking to you again in January. Elizabeth, we are going to sign off the call and thank you for your help.
Operator: Thank you. Once again, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Corporation Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: I would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today is Bruce Tanner, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Please also note that we have posted charts on our website, which supplement our comments today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce.
Bruce Tanner: I would like to begin by stating that overall the corporation had a quarter of numerous operational and financial highlights, but also contained some areas that fell short of our expectations. Financial highlights included our Aeronautics business achieving strong revenue, operating profit and margin growth, Electronic Systems continuing its exceptional margin generation above 13% and the corporation generating cash from operations in excess of $1.1 billion. Financial and operational performance in IS&GS fell short of our expectations this quarter and caused us to reduce its full year financial outlook. Improvements from our other business segments and the benefit of our cash deployment actions enabled us to maintain and reaffirm our full year financial guidance for the corporation. Before I move into the specific elements of our second quarter performance, I want to provide an update on the budget deliberations on the core defense authorization bill, as well as actions taken this quarter by the Department of Defense to realign its program priorities. Congressional budget committees continued to propose revisions to the administration's $534 billion FY 2010 core defense budget target. Consistent with the revised program priorities outlined by the Department of Defense, the budget committees have shown strong endorsement of our F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The proposed 2010 budget contains over $10 billion in funding for continued development and low rate production activities, including funds for 30 new aircraft for the LRIP 2 Contract. Increased support of the Littoral Combat Ship was also evidenced with the budget containing funds to procure up to three ships. Other programs identified for potential budget increases included Aegis, THAAD, Advanced EHF satellites with a balance of our program portfolio remaining well supported. These program recommendations will be reviewed by the full Congress in the coming months as the budget deliberations are concluded later this year. In addition to the ongoing congressional budget discussions, the Department of Defense began implementation of its revised program priorities outlined earlier this year by Secretary Gates. DoD contractual actions taken on our programs this quarter included the termination of the VH-71 presidential helicopter program. This termination for convenience resulted in our stopping work on the program and reducing our backlog by approximately $1 billion. The DoD also announced its intention to not proceed with the next-generation Transformational Satellite or TSAT program. With the cancellation of the future TSAT satellite constellation, the TMOS ground segment contract work that we started performing in 2006 supporting the TSAT program was also terminated for convenience. This termination action resulted in an additional reduction in our backlog of $1.6 billion. The combined backlog reduction for VH-71 and TMOS terminations was $2.6 billion and was reflected in our second quarter backlog value. Solid new award bookings in excess of $12 billion in the quarter helped mitigate the impact of the program termination and limited the net backlog reduction to $1.5 billion. Our overall backlog at the end of the quarter remained strong at nearly $80 billion. Turning to our second quarter results, overall the corporation achieved solid financial performance, won key new business awards and completed significant operational milestones. Financial achievements on the quarter included sales growth consistent with our expectations and strong cash generation. With second quarter activities generating over $1.1 billion in cash from operations, we were able to continue to make opportunistic share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million shares of our stock for $453 million. This brings our year-to-date share repurchase total to 13.7 million shares at a cost of $1 billion. Our ongoing share repurchase actions have enabled us to reduce our fully diluted share count to approximately 391 million shares, achieving the lowest share level, since the year 2000. Let me now turn to review of our business area performance. Starting with our Information Systems & Global Services business, as I noted earlier, sales growth, operating profit and margin levels in the quarter, fell short of our expectations. Despite IS&GS's record of new business wins, protest by loosing competitors on programs are preventing IS&GS from ramping up sales levels as quickly as projected. We've also seen additional constraints on sales growth due to funding delays in other areas. These pressures have caused us to slightly reduce the IS&GS sales outlook for 2009. Operating profits were also significantly below our expectations. Key drivers for the shortfall were work [fee] lower than anticipated, program performance levels that were not sufficient to enable plan profit booking rate increases and start-up issues on several new awards. These items resulted in a reevaluation of full-year projections and caused us to reduce its operating profit for 2009. We are applying additional resources to improving execution in this important business area and remain committed to setting and achieving high standards of operational excellence. Looking at the new business performance of IS&GS. Key awards this quarter included a five-year contract from the Department of Energy to manage and operate the new Mission Support Contract at its Hanford, Washington site. The initial $1.5 billion contract has the potential value of over $3 billion, if the additional five-year option is exercised. This contract was originally awarded in the fourth quarter of 2008, but was placed under protest by a losing competitor. With successful resolution of the protest this quarter, we look forward to expanding our portfolio of work and partnership with the DOE. IS&GS was also selected by the General Services Administration to compete for a future information technology task orders under its next-generation Alliance contract. Alliance is a government wide acquisition contract to provide IT services, products and solutions to worldwide [client] agencies. Finally, IS&GS was selected by the US Army to compete for future task orders on the Army Battle Command System Management Contract. The five-year IDIQ contract has a potential value of nearly $800 million. Contract task orders will be used to migrate existing Army Command Systems, to a net-centric service-oriented architecture that will enable interoperability with other Army Systems. In our Electronics Systems business, we won a $100 million international contract from Saudi Arabia to deliver Sniper Advanced Targeting Pods, F-11 Fighters. This multi-year modernization program will be provide the Royal Saudi Air Force, Advanced Targeting Pods technology that includes enhanced image clarity, long-range target detection and real-time targeting for weapons. Domestically the US Air Force selected Electronics Systems to reform on the IDIQ lifecycle program support contract for the HN Thunderbird Aircraft. This contract has a potential value of $1.6 billion. Our activities will simply center on providing systems engineering and programming configuration management to modernize and sustain the aircrafts. These modernization actions will ensure the long-term readiness and sustainment of the aircrafts to the war fighter. Electronics Systems also had key operational accomplishment this quarter, in the increasingly important of area of Theater Missile Defense. We achieved successful rollout of the first production at weapon system. This further positions our proven missile defense system for expanded availability to domestic and international customers. The THAAD System is expected to provide a pivotal role in the ballistic missile defense of our nation and allies. THAAD was highlighted by the DoD as an area of the expansion in the revised defense priorities outlined earlier this year and also has received strong expression of interest by multiple international countries, including Japan and the United Arab Emirates. Turning to our Space Systems business. Our team also continued to win significant domestic and international contracts. The US Air Force awarded a $1.5 billion contract for additional assets on the SBIRS program. The new contract procures a third highly elliptical orbit payload, a third geosynchronous orbit satellite and associated ground modifications. These additional assets will further expand the capabilities of this vitally important national program in providing early warning of missile launches -- excuse me while simultaneously supporting missile defense, technical intelligence and battle space awareness missions. International new business awards, include award of a contract from JCSAT, Corporation of Japan to build its next commercial jail stationary communication satellite. The new space craft will utilize the proven design of our A2100 satellite bus and is scheduled for launch in 2013. Before leaving space, we should not let a significant moment like the 40th Anniversary of the first man landing on the moon, pass without saying congratulations again to the NASA team. Lockheed Martin and our heritage companies have been proud to provide their contribution to that momentous lunar landing. And we look forward to helping NASA with their future successes through their development or deployment of our next-generation Orion crew exploration vehicle. Moving to the Aeronautic business. Our team delivered another quarter of strong performance as they continue to win international and domestic new business awards, while achieving operational milestones across our portfolio of programs. The C-130J aircraft continues to be recognized by domestic and international customers as the most cost effective and proven airlifter of choice. New aircraft awards for the C-130J included an order from Oman for one aircraft and an [FMS] authorization to buy four aircraft to Iraq. These international orders expand the number of nations that have acquired C-130Js to 11. In addition to the new aircraft orders, the US Marine Corps issued a sole-source award to Aeronautics to modify three KC-130J aircraft under the Harvest Hawk program. This aircraft modification contract and new C-130J aircraft awards demonstrate the unique qualifications and flexibility of our team in responding to a wide spectrum of customer requirements. This flexibility in our proven product had the program solely position to continue its growth and annual production rate to at least 24 aircraft in 2010. Moving to operational performance. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter team continued to expand their low rate initial production work and retire development risks on the program. Key milestone events accomplished this quarter include successful completion of hover-pit tests on the BF-1 STOVL aircraft. The test also confirmed that the engine generated more vertical for us than DoD performance requirements. These successful tests clear the aircraft to proceed with expanded flight test followed by vertical landings and hover flights later this year. Another critical success this quarter was completion of the static test program on the STOVL aircraft. The static test required the aircraft to be tested to 150% of its designed limit load and resulted in no structural failures. This test confirmed the strength of not only the STOVL test article, but the validity of the design models used on all three variants. We also took the structural test article to the point of failure at over 220% of the design load limits to validate the additional structural margin of the design. Achievement of this structural test helps clear the full flight envelope and removes restrictions from the STOVL flight test program.
 : Parallel testing of the avionics systems using the CATBird is a key component of the ongoing risk mitigation activities on the F-35 program and applies to lessons learned on prior Legacy aircraft. In the area of program funding, Congressional support for the program remain strong as evidenced by the Department of Defense award of $2.1 billion on the LRIP Lot 3 contract this quarter. This contract provides funding for 14 US aircraft, plus two aircraft to United Nation and one aircraft for Netherlands and brings our LRIP backlog to 31 aircraft plus long-lead for an additional 30 LRIP 4 aircraft. International support for the program continues to build with announcements this quarter from two additional partner countries reaffirming their intention to purchase the F-35. The Norwegian Parliament approved the F-35 is their next-generation fighter and Australia released their defense white paper outlining their intention to purchase F-35 fighters. With these announcements, three of the eight partners have reaffirmed their intention to purchase future production F-35 aircraft. With steady progress and risk retirement, strong funding support and growing international customer commitment, the F-35 program remains on track to ramp up production. Lastly, we did close on an acquisition in the quarter with our purchase of Imes Strategic Support Limited. Based on Scotland Imes provides engineering, maintenance, repair and support on the UK Royal Navy's Trident Strategic Weapons System program. This acquisition expands our Fleet Ballistic Missile franchise into the UK and will enable us to offer a broader set of solutions to both our US and UK customers. This acquisition would be managed within our Space Systems business area. These highlights demonstrate our strong win rate and continued program operational execution as we work to continue delivered it, increased value to shareholders and customers. Finally, we were proud to be recognized by Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine for the second consecutive year has the best performing large cap aerospace company in its recently released top performing company study. This award underscores our daily focus and commitments to provide value to shareholders, as a direct reflection of our talented workforce. I’d now like to open up the line for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Peter Arment with Broadpoint AmTech.
Peter Arment – Broadpoint AmTech: Could you talk a little bit about IS&G, just the been growth going forward, I think you’re looking for 10% growth for the year at least sequentially in the back half of the year. Can you just maybe give us a little more color there?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. Like as we said here today, maybe what ought to do, I’m sure this going to be several questions on IS&GS, so just kind of give a rundown on a number of point, I want to make there. I’m going to start if you will, with the second quarter sales price in GS, which were up a $160 million over a last year about 6%. Most of that growth occurred in our defense line of business, within IS&GS as you recall, we operate in the civil, defense and intelligence LOBs in that business area. The other two LOBs besides defense were fairly flat. And really what's driving that flatness, especially in the civil side is protest and to a lesser extent some customer funding delays. I'll just give you an interesting stat out, looking at as I was getting ready for this call. We've had 88 awards within IS&GS this year, five of those 88 awards were protested and of those five, three of those would have been on the outlook at the start of the year, within our top 10 contracts for sales in 2009. So, although five out of 88 might not sound like a big number, they were three of the larger programs we're expecting to generate sales for the whole year. I'll talk to a couple of specifics ones there. DOE Hanford contract, I mentioned on the prepared remarks; we won in December of 2008, it's really just now starting up. Similarly the [FASTer] contract which we reported last quarter as a win, that's likely going to be a new competition. And expectation at this point that competition won't be solved or settled until the 2010 timeframe, which essentially says zero sales for that contract in 2009. Now on top of that, we've had some activities within our Department of State work that have been slowed to get funded, primarily because of staffing by the customer in this area. EBIT, it was down for the quarter, about $25 million, about 9% from the last year, the ROIC is down a 130 basis points. Now couple of things driving that in the quarter, mostly again within civil we had a performance adjustment that we took in 2008, I think of this in $10 million to $15 million range. We had no such adjustment in 2009, although we had been hoping to have some more adjustments occur in 2009, they did not occur. We've also had some start-up issues on a couple of our new contracts as I mentioned in our prepared remarks in civil. And lastly, I talked also that we've had less low performance in our intelligence business that we are probably working to correct. So, probably more specifically to your direct question, Peter, the sales in the second half of the year particularly given the protest impact that we already see, we're probably expecting more like 8% growth year-over-year, second half of '09, compared to second half of 2008. And what that really indicates is we don't expect to make the volume loss due to delays or protest. I think it's also important to say that we're expecting the fourth quarter to be a much higher quarter sales wise than the third quarter. If you look back at the history of IS&GS you will note that the fourth quarter tends to be a higher, this is more the seasonal nature of the IS&GS business. Fourth quarter of calendar year is the first quarter of the fiscal year and we tend to get a lot of contracts, especially the product contracts for short-term sales opportunities in the fourth quarter. You didn't ask about margins in the second half, but I'll go and address that as well. I think margins in the second half are look to be probably similar to those in the first half. And really what that entails is we are expecting some of the second quarter issues that led to the second quarter downer that I talked about previously, to also dampen the last two quarters of the year. We'd also hope when we started the year, there were a couple of contractual matters that we had hoped would be settled in the second half of this year. As we sit here today, both of those are likely to be pushed out and both worth less than we'd expected at the start of the year. So, probably a broader response to the question you asked, Peter. But I want to give you the full color there.
Peter Arment – Broadpoint AmTech: No, I appreciate that. Thanks, Bruce. And just so either way I understand is for reaching your upper end of your guidance range, is the margin trend I guess going forward is going to have to still ramp somewhat also on terms of, for the run rate that we're at this quarter?
Bruce Tanner: Within IS&GS?
Peter Arment – Broadpoint AmTech: Yes.
Bruce Tanner: Actually, I think we'll be fairly consistent with the first half of the year for IS&GS. Is my expected outlook, Peter?
Operator: And we will go next to Itay Michaeli with Citi.
Itay Michaeli - Citi: Just going back to second half margin particularly for Aeronautics and Electronics, you talked about the Canadian solution you're expecting there, I mean it looks like revenue should be accelerating in the second half and just how you feel about potential upside there in the second half of the year?
Bruce Tanner: For Electronics and Aeronautics you said?
Itay Michaeli - Citi: Yes, Bruce.
Bruce Tanner: Let's start with the Electronics came in with a fairly flat to down quarter in the second quarter of this year, compared to the second quarter of last year. Last year, second quarter was a bit of tough compared with this one, because it was the largest quarter of the year for Electronic Systems and there were a number of timing deliveries particularly in missiles and fire controls. They happened in the second quarter of last year that we don't expect to be replicated in this year second quarter. Although, the Electronic Systems is down just a THAAD from second half last year, other than the missile and fire control being down, the other two lines of business within Electronic Systems, the MH2 and PMT, LOBs are both up in the second quarter. As I look towards to the second half of the year, I honestly think the third quarter is probably going to look very similarly to the second quarter. And then, we are expecting to have very strong growth in the fourth quarter, and a couple of things are driving that. One is, we do expect to have a much higher level, just as we did second quarter of 2008, a much higher level deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to third quarter. Think of this is PAC-3 Missiles, HELLFIRE missiles and [the alike]. We also have and I know you guys have read about this. We also have had delays in getting the JASSM missiles accepted because we haven't completed the acceptance testing on that. We hope to have that complete later in the third quarter or fourth quarter and when that is complete, that will free up a lot of the JASSM backlog has been waiting to be booked from a revenue perspective if you will. I should also point out that with the T for C, the Termination for Convenience on the VH-71 program. That program probably had about $300 million of sales in the second half of the year outlook prior to the termination. So, my guess is that, our Electronic Systems will probably come in closer to the lower end of the range as we currently have it than even in the middle part of that range.
Itay Michaeli - Citi: A quick follow-up on Space, in the past you've talked about a flattish top-line growth outlook beyond '09. Was that the backlog is coming in? It's growing pretty nicely. Do you think there might be some upside to that or you still looking more of a flattish top-line outlook?
Bruce Tanner: I didn't answer to your aerial question, so I'll come back to that in a second. I think there is probably some nominal upside, particularly on the classified areas, where we have some potential for growth there. In the second half of the year for Space compared to the second half last year is actually going to have very strong growth probably about 8% range, we're just looking from a guidance perspective. Most of that because we have two satellite and a launch vehicle in the second half we had none in the first half of the year. I’d also think margins are likely going to be a little bit up in the second half for our Space as well. I’d like to go back if I could, Aeronautics US about the question on Space, just what the outlook is for the second half, is that right?
Itay Michaeli - Citi: Correct.
Bruce Tanner: Second half of the year in Aeronautics, is going to look very strong, we believe. Now, I think the total for the second half is probably going to be at the 10% sales growth or so over the second half of 2008 and what I’d expect to see is that we’ll have sequential growth quarter-to-quarter. So, the fourth quarter will be obviously, above 10% and the third quarter maybe little below or probably little bit below 10% in the third quarter. What’s driving that? We have three additional F-16 and four additional C-130s in the second of the year as compared to the first half of the year. So, I think we’re going to see some growth there along with the continued uptick in the growth on the F-35 programs in the second half of the year.
Operator: We’ll go next to Brian Ruttenbur with Morgan Keegan.
Brian Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan: I have some housekeeping questions. So, I going to ask two at once, I think is the plan. First of all, on the repurchase of stocks, if you could tell us what you base your estimates on along with the tax rate on the year? So, those are both my question and my follow-up is about the stock share count that you plan to have at yearend and the tax rate you have to have in the second half of the year to be in guidance?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, our guidance on the share count is essentially flat from where we are now about $391 million and tax rate probably within again somewhere about a little than lower 31, 31 to 31.5 for the entire year what we are looking right now.
Brian Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan:  Right, so you don’t plan to purchase anymore stock in these numbers, right?
Bruce Tanner: On the guidance that's right.
Operator: We will go next to George Shapiro with Access 342.
George Shapiro - Access 342: I want to go back to IS&GS, I mean it looks to me like you released some high expectation about $50 million short in profit and you took down an effectively the second half of the year by $80 million. So, most of what you saw in the second quarter you’re expecting to recur in the third and fourth quarter. So, if you could just go through a little bit more rationale than you did is to why that occurred?
Bruce Tanner: Look here very perceptive. If we just had the 10% growth in sales in the second quarter that we were hoping for and maintain the margin that about the level of last year, you are spot on it about $50 million miss from what our expectations would have been in the second quarter. And you are also right that says about $85 million is what left for the second half of the year. I think hopefully I explained the first half well enough to kindly understandable. The second half again is, this is kind of get a little bit of accounting stuff, but this is on our service contract accountings what which this business area has probably 55% of its total sales is in service contract accounting. When we record an issue on a contract it’s not like your standard accounting, on say last 16 contracts where we take a provision for today and you take a provision for future issues as well. This has to play out overtime. And so we expect the impact that we're seeing in the second quarter to also occur through the rest of the second half of the year, just because of that accounting nature. And as I said in the response to the earlier call, we had two contractual items planned in the second half that we really thought we were going to get some fairly sizeable improvements on. Neither one of those now looks like, it's going to happen in the year. So, we pushed those out. Both of them, as I said earlier are a little less in value than we'd expected them to be, at the time we set our guidance up in the first place.
George Shapiro - Access 342: And Bruce, just in general sense, it seems like most of the issues they are more in the civil side versus the defense side. I mean obviously, some of the delays are on the defense side. Does it make you think a question, the kind of the strategy of growing in some of the civil areas, and I guess is anything changing as a result of that?
Bruce Tanner: No. Look, I still think civil is where we're going to see some of our strongest growth within this business area. And I think, I don't want to loose track of that fact. I mean if I look back to the 2006 timeframe with this business area, we've grown this business area by $3.5 billion in sales since that time and over $300 million in EBIT. I mean it was an important part of Lockheed Martin then, it's become an even more important part now and I suspect that will be the case in the future as well. So, no, I don't regret that we're in the civil business. I think again that's going to be a big part of our business going forward.
George Shapiro - Access 342: And then just one quick one if I might. On the first quarter call you actually said that you saw some margin in IS&GS would be a little higher than average this quarter to make up for the relatively weak first quarter. So, given as that call occurred three weeks into the second quarter. I mean is this an area then that you don't have the same degree of predictability, as you would like or is it just unusual that something happened to occur from when you made those comments in Q1?
Bruce Tanner: It's probably the most heavily dependent on award fee, within many of the four business areas. Most of those award fees tend to happen in the second and fourth quarter in this business area. When I made that comment in the first quarter, I had expected us to kind of have the normal award fee scoring that we would expect to have in the second quarter, as we did last year for instance. And it was until late in the quarter, and those things typically come in the May, June timeframe. It wasn't until late in the quarter that we saw those materializing at the lower levels there. So, that was probably the surprise from my perspective, George.
Operator: And we'll go next to Troy Lahr with Stifel Nicolaus.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus:  On the lower award fees, is this you just kind of missing some milestones, or do you think the customers getting a little tougher in paying out some of those award fees?
Bruce Tanner: I want to be real clear on this. This has nothing to do with the tougher scorecard. This has nothing to do with acquisition reforms, some one, challenging the high level of award fee. We didn't perform as well we are capable of. The customer reflected that in there scoring through us. And we've got to fix that on our side. There is nothing else than that.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus: And then, so you had some executions issues. You have the startup issues there also. I mean, what changes are you implementing and how much confidence do you have that these are just kind of some near-term issues that you can't get your hands around, so that they don't become this problem quarter after quarter after quarter?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, no it's fair question. Let's see, we've really kind of brought in, I can speak for my own organization, specifically our finance organization. We've kind of thrown subject matter experts from the other three lines of business, along with some corporate staff and kind of descended upon IS&GS to take a look at some of the practices there to make sure, yes the business that, as I said earlier has grown up very quickly in the last few years. We want to make sure all our process are very sound, so this doesn't happen going forward. This is an interesting business and that if you take a look at the backlog for IS&GS, it's just a little more than the sales for IS&GS. So literally this business kind of reinvents itself practically on a quarterly basis, definitely on an annual basis. So, one of the good thing or bad things given that scenario is, we'll get a chance as these contracts kind of play out very quickly to bid new contracts, and see if we can start off on a better foot with those new contracts. I mean I'm looking for more sizable orders in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. And given the rapid turnover of these contracts that's where we are going to see if this performance items are fixed or not.
Troy Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus: So the added resource you're talking about, that's just putting more people on the program?
Bruce Tanner: It's putting people and I'll say much more focus at a fairly senior level including Bob Stevens.
Operator:  And we'll go next to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs:  Last quarter, you were asked about where you see red programs. I realized you guys have thousands of programs. But your answer to that question alluded to some things in space and to some things in ES and you didn't even touch on IS&GS. So how was it that this was kind of not on the radar screen and really snuck up on you?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. I think we have a pretty thorough process by which we evaluate. We literally categorize all of our programs, we kind of put them into piles based on similar sized programs and we grade them, green, yellow, red, just like the stoplight chart, as you would expect us to do. IS&GS, I don't believe since IS&GS has been created that we've had a red program within IS&GS. In the second quarter, we had two of them pop up very surprisingly. One was in the classified area in the Intelligence business, as we’ve talked about previously and the other one was a fairly large contract within our civil business. So, while we had yellow indications on a number of programs, none of them turn red until the second quarter, whereas the others as I alluded to in the previous call, I’d say we already characterized in the red category.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: You guys obviously had this very differentiated Aeronautic story, when we look at what's going on in the budget environment, what kind of two to three year growth rate can the non-Aeronautics part of the business see, particularly as we re-calibrate for this pressure on IS&GS, which you guys had been previously highlighted as the next best segment after Aeronautics?
Bruce Tanner: For the next how long did you say Noah?
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Next two to three years, as the administrations priorities really start to flow through the budget.
Bruce Tanner: I think I have said on many occasions, you excluded Aeronautics, but I'll hit that in anyway. The Aeronautics we expect to be driving the growth of the corporation of the next year driven predominantly by the F-35 program in that period of time. IS&GS, even at the outlook we are looking at now is 8% growth and that is good growth I think by anyone's measure and we still think that is sustainable. Again, for a top-line perspective, the reason we had came up that is not because we are losing contracts, because contracts got protested. I think that environment will improve going forward. I still think as I look at the marketplace that IS&GS participates in, we still think that marketplace is expanding. Because if you remember that marketplace goes well beyond the DoD marketplace. So, those two business areas of the four, I still think it grow at fairly rapid clips, much faster than the DoD budget. I would think Electronics is still probably mid-single digit growth for the foreseeable future and one of the reasons it will potentially go higher than that because of the international growth primarily on air missile defense. Space, as I said earlier, I think we are going to have some nominal growth there. The wild card there could be some classified growth, but I'm not sure, I know enough at this point to tell you how much more that could be. Total Corporation, we still think it's somewhere in the mid-single digit, maybe a little higher than that for that period of time you’re talking about. I’ll also say, it's probably a little premature as you might expect, we are going to provide the 2010 guidance in October, I’ll give you hopefully a whole lot more detail picture at that timeframe.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: When we look at what F-35 is doing, does that imply a very close to flat total growth for the non-Aeronautics part of the business?
Bruce Tanner: Noah, I'm actually expecting some fairly significant growth in the C-130 program during that period of time as well. So, you've got some mitigating, probably two programs. One is the C-5 program with the re-engineering on that strategic airlifter and the C-130 program, both going to grow.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Yes, so I'm asking for the three segments that are not Aeronautics.
Bruce Tanner: I'm sorry. I missed out your question.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: So, does what are you saying imply that the non-Aeronautics part of the business, the other three segments in aggregate are kind of a flattish business over the next two to three years?
Bruce Tanner: No, not at all. That’s not, what I'm saying at all. I said IS&GS is going to go faster than probably the corporation in total. I think Electronic Systems will probably go pretty close to the corporation's average and I think Space will grow little bit lower than the other three business areas, but any of that I still expect to see some nominal growth.
Operator: We will go next to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Question on F-22, with the seven aircraft up for vote, is there anything significant about that number, clearly $2 billion is a sizable number, but is this a figure that allows you to bridge to and export program perhaps to Japan and where do you see that standing at this time?
Bruce Tanner: I think the short answer to your first question is no. It would not allow us to bridge to a Japanese sale or any other international sale at this time. I’m not sure we’ve got a good answer for you as to why seven aircraft be reportedly (inaudible) and I’m sorry the latter part of your question was again?
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Well, the latter part was about the export opportunity and where you think that’s stand on a hill at this point.
Bruce Tanner: We still say precluded from being able to sell because of a Congressional amendment. So, until the amendment is rescinded, if it's rescinded there is no likelihood of international sale, but another has been discussion on that, but it will literally take the active Congress to repeal that law before we could sale them internationally. I’m not particularly positive on the ability for us to make that happen in the next few years.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: And Bruce, where does production on long lead product standard at this point, the very early stuff and then is my follow-up, if you could just refresh us on the top competitive opportunities for Lockheed; let's say over the next couple of quarters.
Bruce Tanner: When you say the production, Rob, I guess you're talking about F-35?
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Well, I'm talking about F-22, but in terms of the real early smaller components on that program, have they ceased production at this point?
Bruce Tanner: From a supply base perspective?
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Yes.
Bruce Tanner: It's getting real close. Think of this is kind of three-year cycles from contract award to aircraft delivery and our piece of that is probably in the last 12 months or so of that three-year cycle. So, suppliers tend to be the much longer legged portion of that effort. Think of it, the early part of that, mostly with metals, think as specialty titaniums and the like. So, those folks are literally probably at the end of this year will start seeing some impact if this nothings turned on.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse:  Then the other part was just on competitive programs?
Bruce Tanner: Competitive programs, honestly third quarter is probably going to look a little light. We are heavily weighted in fourth quarter. There is a number of competitions happening then. I would like to think we'd see an F-16 Egyptian order by that point in time. I'm also optimistic about a couple of C-130J international opportunities happening in the fourth quarter. I think this could be a big year. My question is whether it happens before the end of the calendar year or not, but we're expecting some big things happening on the C-130J international front as well as domestic front and not to distant future. Other big programs, competitions, it's not competitions. I guess it's actually a sole-source at this point, but we expect a large order within Electronic Systems on PAC-3 for Taiwan. We have previously done in both Singapore and the UK kind of a turnkey training activity. We expect sort of the next follow-on of that within Singapore, called the Singapore Fighter Wings course to occur in the fourth quarter. And then, on top of that there is probably, as I look at just see other data is probably close to $3 billion of follow-on business, not competitive, but follow-on business within Electronics Systems and we expect to materialize in the fourth quarter.
Rob Spingarn - Credit Suisse: Did you mentioned at all before, when you talking about opportunities with F-35 partners, the timing on some of those orders?
Bruce Tanner: Timing of the orders, no, I don’t know that I have a real good answer for you there, as far as my expectations. I would think, we start seeing those orders probably next year or 2011, early 2011, one or the other, Rob.
Operator: We’ll go next to Joseph Nadol with JPMorgan
Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan: Bruce, just back on IS&GS just for a moment. What I hear you saying is that, we had some protest and then couple of performance flip ups during the quarter, that are going to impact us not only in the quarter, but the rest of the year. But at the same time, several of your competitors out there, large and small have had some issues year-to-date in services, and of course, we all hear some of the things coming out of the government on in-sourcing and there has been more pricing competition etcetera. I mean, how much of this do you really think is just a couple of flip ups and how much of it is, is just a structural change it’s happening in the services business, big picture?
Bruce Tanner: Well, I don’t think any of the sales impact that we’re seeing has anything to do with this. Yes, as you described the in-sourcing or even the competitive, more price competitive, I think we have a very competitive offering across the Board within our IS&GS business area. And again I don’t think the in-sourcing impact the sales at all. If you look at the EBIT side of the earning side, I’d characterize those as our issue, not driven by any other externalities. We didn’t perform as well as we are capable of and that's ours to fix.
Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan: So, it's really in your view nothing that can prevent that will prevent you, assuming you get back to your performance last year or in 2007 nothing to prevent your margin from getting it back up to the mid nine?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. There is nothing kind of structurally as I look it now, it says that can't be done. We’ve got a correct the things that we slipped on and continue to win new cons. Again as I said earlier, this is the business that turns over practically every year, continue to win new contracts at the kind of margins that will allows us to do that. I think that simple.
Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan: Have you examined the OCI language that's out there and determine whether this is going to be any conflict of interest issue to your business, where you might have to divest any businesses, any lines of business etcetera?
Bruce Tanner: We wouldn’t get into either acquisition or divestitures, but we have examined the OCI language. We don’t think we have a lot of exposure there. Less I’d say probably than a lot of our competitors, but it is something we are watching closely. We will continue to watch going forward.
Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan: Then just for one quick follow-up and F-35 just given all the budget, I think going on right now in Congress, now the moving part. Can you just give what level of sales you expect from that program next year versus this year even so its round number?
Bruce Tanner: I hate to even hasten, I guess Joe. It is going to be significant growth in the F-35 part of next year. I talked to some of you folks at the Paris Air Show in the couple of sessions over there, I talked about the longstanding commitment that says, we would probably could have a $20 billion Aeronautics business within the year 2015. If you just put and say that probably 75 plus percent of that $20 billion, we expect to be the F-35 program in 2015 and if you kind of play annual compound, annual growth rates on those numbers, and it's going to grow in excess of 20% a year to get to that level and we still feel confident about that number in 2015. Hopefully that helps.
Operator: We will go next to Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein:  I wanted to stay on in IS&GS. The thing that I find difficult is that we've got multiple issues here at one-time in a unit that's really performed very well over recent years. And from what you're saying I understand that we’ve got two red programs, one in civil, one in intel. There's a slow start with some state department work, which I assume is in global services?
Bruce Tanner:  Correct.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein:  And then you have five protested programs and those are mixed, civil and defense. Is that correct? And those are the ones that those are delayed and slowing revenue growth. Is that correct?
Bruce Tanner:  Correct.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Then what I'm trying to understand is, is it a coincidence of these things have happened or is there something overall in IS&GS since there across multiple units that you feel needs to be addressed here?
Bruce Tanner: That's an interesting question, Doug. I don't think that I see anything that is kind of like the common denominator across all the things that you mentioned there. I think the funding delays have more to do with the administration, not necessarily having the right people in place in the areas, where we had some growth last year that we seen from slackening off this year. I ultimately think that’s going to get fixed with the right people in place and we’ll get back on board there. The protest, the only comment I think we’ve been hit harder within IS&GS probably, simply because they compete for more quantities of contracts than any other business area in the corporation. We’ve been able to, with a higher percentage of those protest maybe than we have previously and they have all kind of come in fairly short order. As I said earlier, the big thing is they hit some of our more sizable contracts as well. We protested all the time in this business area, but often times they are on contracts that you don’t necessarily watch or follow or that don’t make that big they hit to us.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: It sounds like the execution issues are two pretty separate ones, I mean those are pretty different businesses. And from what you’re saying in the State Department work, I'm assuming, when you say the administration, you getting people in, this is not an issue with this administration, it’s an issue of the transition to a new administration that slows that down. Is that?
Bruce Tanner: You said it well.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Then the one other aspects of this is that you said how the business does tend to turn over even more quickly. And I know it’s also the backlog has come down. So, as you look forward here, you are constantly tending to deal with some new customers sets within the Federal Government, say maybe new types of projects. Is this in anyway contributing to more risk, you are in some different areas, is that a possible?
Bruce Tanner: Some of those that we talked about in the intelligence is absolutely in our core has been in our core for a long, long time. So, I don’t. I’d hate to characterize it is because we are casting too wide a net if you will. There was some basic blocking intact and they got, got away from us on a couple of these things that we got to fixed. I don’t think it limits or shattering. I think it's all fixed. We dedicate ourselves and take the actions necessary to fix it. I think that's simple.
Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein: So, when Linda Gooden talks about the double-digit growth that she expect, I think on more of a multiyear basis. I mean this is still in your view very much intact.
Bruce Tanner: I still think IS&GS will be amongst our highest growth business area going forward. I literally said through a briefing here not a few weeks ago, there we do see opportunities outside of the current marketplace that are growing very significantly. That we think we have a very good opportunity to plan and I think we have demonstrated just by the success of the past and we can play the market we are currently in and grow very considerably as well. Again most of that has come by outstripping the growth in the market at this point, we really kind of done that through taking market share from competitors. We still think that's possible because this business area operates in a markets place that is incredibly disaggregated. It's a very farflung area. The basic activities that we do though in those different marketplaces are not all that different between them and among themselves if that make sense.
Operator:  We will go next to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Bruce, you mentioned in the backlog changed with some of the termination like VH-71 and TSAT. What should we think about in terms of the second half in terms of any P&L impact from those in terms of contract close outs and termination fees etcetera?
Bruce Tanner:  You TSAT, it was related TSAT, but it was actually on the TMOS, it’s on the ground segment portion of TSAT and I wouldn't expect to see any earnings impact from those going forward.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Did the new AEHF is supposed to go in? Have you seen that order yet in terms of moving into backlog?
Bruce Tanner: Yes. I think that it has. I believe it has.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: And then just a follow-up, really separately; as given the market recovery we've seen in the second quarter, can you talk a little bit about the pension performance in the second quarter and where you stand year-to-date versus we assumed return on asset?
Bruce Tanner: You've seen the marketplace just like we have, and I’d say that we are ahead of where we would be on a normal trend to get to the 8.5% level that we premised for the annual return on our pension plan. So, as we sit here today, what is it July 21st? I think we are ahead of schedule on that.
Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities: Can you quantify what that return is?
Bruce Tanner: No, because it's going to bounce around between them. We will obviously tell you by the end of the year, we will give you an outlook in October for the 2010 timeframe, but obviously we're at this point ahead of where we would otherwise be if we were just tracking to the 8.5%.
Operator: We will take our next question from Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: I got to believe, where the IS&GS question one in a slightly different way. It seems that IS&GS is one of your shorter cycle businesses. So, withstand to reason that would be more susceptible to the after effects of both the change in the administration and tighter budgets. And you've taken great efforts to stress that its internal performance, but just to be devil’s advocate was read just a moment, if we look at tighter budget conditions ahead, when we'd be expecting tougher grading from customers, more protest and still a ramp up on programs and slower awards versus what you encountered in the last eight years in the Bush administration?
Bruce Tanner: I’d like to think that as we go forward with the new administration and a new outlook and a new expectation of what is right in the acquisition process. I’d like to think the number of protest would diminish as opposed to increase or even stay constant. And that maybe overly optimistic on my part, but I still think that’s good for the industry, if we in fact can’t get the protest kind of back, so they are not as those probably one when they are today. The other part of your question relatively to the scoring and so forth, it hasn’t happened at this point, Heidi. Again I have try to make this characterize this as these are our issues to fix. There has been a lot’s of talk and discussion about that relative to the acquisition reform, but nothing that has come up that I have seen. They talks about different levels that would cause a concern of what's been written at this point. I guess is the best way to say it.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: All right, but then, because the thing many of us are concerned as we look at, as this business has grown I don’t think we challenge the growth. I think it’s more whether the growth can be company with 9% margins or whether future ahead is sort of 8ish. But maybe you could give us color on, whether civil margins, because that’s an area of focus. Does that have a structural ability to go higher than overall segment margins?
Bruce Tanner: Overall segment margin for IS&GS in total.
Heidi Wood: Yes.
Bruce Tanner: I’ll honestly, I’d think the answer is, no. We probably frank with you and look at, what I said today, we’ve had these items that kind of popped up in the second quarter. We’ve taken, I think the right action to try to fix them. What I think I need to do is, to see if these actions do in fact kind of stem the performance issues that we saw in the second quarter, see if we can mitigate them somewhat going forward and then by the third quarter I have a whole lot better feel for what new business we have want at that point in time and I’ll be able to give you much better outlook in 2010. 
Bruce Tanner:  Okay. With that I’d like to close by thanking you for joined the call today and for your questions and we look forward to talking to you again in October.
Operator: Once again that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-21 11:00:00) =====

Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin First Quarter 2009 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher: Thank you Michael and good morning everyone. I would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today is Bruce Tanner our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. Please also note that we have posted charts on our website which supplement our comments today. With that, I will turn the call over to, Bruce.
Bruce Tanner: Thanks Jerry. Good morning everyone and welcome to the call. I would like to begin by stating that we had a solid first quarter with strong operational and financial performance across the corporation. Financial highlights include expansion of segment operating profit margin above last year's level, generation of cash from operations in excess of $1.2 billion and maintaining our backlog in excess of $80 billion. Our operational earnings were particularly strong this quarter. We have included a reconciliation sheet on our web charts that outlines the 11% growth in adjusted earnings per share achieved by our operations after removal of the negative FAS/CAS pension adjustment and non-recurring gain in 2008. Our GAAP earnings per share declined only slightly despite the anticipated shift from pension income to pension expense that we disclosed in January and in our 10-K and the lack of any comparable non-recurring items in the quarter. These results were consistent with our expectations and are enabling us to continue providing value to customers and shareholders. Before moving to specific details of our first quarter performance I want to provide an update on the defense budget environment and a brief status on the progress of our continuing efforts to broaden our business portfolio. The FY 2010 core defense budget proposed by the administration in February outlined a budget ceiling of $534 billion. While this budget target reflects growth of approximately 4% above FY 2009 levels, we continue to believe that our revenue growth will exceed the overall DoD rate driven by strong future sales expansion of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and in our information systems and global services business area. In an April 6th press conference, Defense Secretary Gates proposed new program priorities for the upcoming FY 2010 DoD budget. His proposed budget actions range from increases to selective programs, to reductions and cancellations of other programs. Key Lockheed Martin programs identified for potential increases included the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Aegis, THAAD, Littoral Combat Ship and AEHS Satellites. Other key programs recommended for potential decreases including stopping the VH-71 presidential helicopter and ending F-22 Raptor production of 187 aircraft. These recommended program revisions will be reviewed by the President and Congress in the coming month as the FY 2010 budget deliberations are concluded later this year. If these proposed revisions are implemented in the final budget, they represent both opportunities and risk for Lockheed Martin programs going forward. Even if all their proposed program revisions were enacted in the final FY '10 budget, we see no change to our current 2009 guidance. Looking at the overseas contingency fund portion of the FY 2010 defense budget, an initial place holder of $130 billion was inserted in order to continue to fund activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. Determination of the final budget will be made after evaluation of any further requirements. Contingency operational budgets are projected to decline from the peak level and FY 2008 as trip levels are reduced. With very little revenue exposure to the non-core defense budget, we do not see a material impact to our business portfolio from any future reductions in contingency operations budgets. Turning to our non-DoD work, we continue to shape our portfolio to respond to changing requirements. As I look back over the last 10 years we have actively worked to expand our civil government portfolio from approximately 15% of revenues to over 25% last year. This growing civil and government work coupled with our international and commercial business now comprises 42% of our total annual revenues. Growth in civil and government activities is expected to support the administration's new national focus areas such as Smart Power application, cyber security, healthcare, IT and energy. We believe our strategic actions and early recognition of emerging initiatives have us well positioned to provide key solutions to several government customers. New focus areas such as the application of smart power to support nation building actions have enabled us to expand our work in this area which is expected to see additional budget growth in future years. The increased national attention on the critical need for cyber security solutions is another opportunity for our corporation. The growing demand for increased cyber security is expected to provide a multi-billion dollar future opportunity. The need to provide IT solutions, to digitize and manage government Healthcare records is more acute than ever. With the recent completion of our 14th straight year as the largest IT provider to the US Government and our established IT support on large scale data management systems for agencies such as the Department of Justice and Social Security Administration, we are well positioned to provide solutions in this area. Finally we have a growing list of energy related programs and activities within our business units. These activities range from smart grid management to energy efficiency, security and alternative power generation. While still in formative stages; we believe our energy solutions offer future growth opportunities in support of key national leads. These emerging activities coupled with our focus on several government agencies and international customers are expected to provide continued growth in our non-DoD revenues. Turning to our first quarter results, the corporation achieved solid financial performance, operational milestones and won key new business awards. Financial achievements in the quarter included sales growth consistent with our expectations, segment margin expansion and strong cash generation with first quarter activities generating over $1.2 billion in cash from operations, we were able to continue to make opportunistic share repurchases. During the quarter we repurchased 8.1 million shares of our stock for $555 million. Based on first quarter accomplishments we have increased our 2009 full-year guidance for earnings per share, cash from operations and return on invested capital. Details of the new increased guidance are outlined in the webcast chart and in today’s press release. Let me now highlight some of the recent new business awards and operational achievements in each of the business areas. Starting with electronic systems, new business lines included a contract from the US. Navy authorizing construction of our Second Littoral Combat Ship. LCS will become a critical element as the Navy continues to modernize and expand its fleet and we are proud to continue our partnership with the Navy on this revolutionary program. Recent comments by DoD leadership reaffirmed the need to purchase up to 55 LCS vessels to satisfy major requirements. This high level domestic need coupled with international interest in our LCS design offers solid growth opportunities on this program. Internationally, electronic systems received a $665 million contract from Taiwan to upgrade their P-3 maritime patrol reconnaissance aircraft. Upgrades will include new mission system avionics and service life extension kits. These upgrades will provide its Navy with state-of-the-art maritime patrol or reconnaissance aircraft and enable electronic systems to grow its international revenue international revenues. In addition to new business plans, Electronic Systems also had significant operational accomplishments. In the area of theater missile defense our team conducted their six consecutive successful test of the THAAD system. This flight test demonstrated the ability of the system to detect, track and intercept a separating target inside the earth's atmosphere.  The THAAD system is critical to providing ballistic missile defense to domestic and international customers and was recently highlighted by DoD as one of the priority programs in the FY 2010 defense budget. Further validating the importance of the system, THAAD was on operational status and ready to provide missile defense protection during the recent launch of the failed satellite deployment by North Korea. A final key accomplishment in Electronic System was a successful operational use of the view it system. This system provides a real time streaming video to a patchy air crews, improving situational awareness, intelligence and effectiveness against critical targets. I should note that the Electronics team was able to complete the design to production effort in less than seven months and satisfy a rapid fielding request in US army to provide this new system to our war fighters.  I would now like to turn for our fastest growing business, Informational Systems and Global Services. The IS&GS team continues to lead the corporation on top line sales growth again this quarter. The new business win rate success of IS&GS differentiates them from competitors and enabled expansion of their revenues by 10% above last year's level. Key awards this quarter included a contract from the US special operations command to provide full scope logistic support to special operation troops around the globe. This 10-year ID/IQ contract has a potential value of up to $5 billion. Although, this award has been placed under protest by a competitor, we look forward to successful protest resolutions so work can proceed and enable us to provide critical logistic support to this key customer. Other IS&GS wins included $400 million award by the General Services Administration to provide system support to the federal and acquisition service. These wins at IS&GS have solid backlog and we expect that to continue generating the highest revenue growth of all of our business areas this year. Before leaving IS&GS, I wanted to reiterate our press release disclosure earlier today announcing the realignment of IS&GS's three lines of business effective January 1st. This realignment to several defense and intelligence better aligns the segment based on its core customers and business activities. Current quarter and historical financial results have been realigned to provide comparative financial data. Looking at the Aeronautics business, our team continues to perform at an exceptional level and successfully won key international and domestic new business awards this quarter. Despite Aeronautics continuing focus on expansion of their services and logistics work, they grew their international portfolio with the receipt of a $300 million multiyear contract to provide seamless services for the Royal Australian Air Force for C-130J aircrafts. This contract will provide innovative solutions and may have some engineering and will utilize our supply chain management expertise to reduce the cost of ownership of the C-130J aircraft in the Australian fleet. This effort builds upon similar sustainment activities that we will provide to the UK, Italy and Canada for their C-130J fleets. Aeronautics sustainment activities continue to improve aircraft availability rates and reduce the cost of fleet ownership.  Domestic new business awards this quarter included a contract in US Air Force for additional modernization work on a C-5 and Super Galaxy airlifter program. This contract provides funds for work on nine additional aircrafts under the reliability enhancement and re-engineering program. Three modernized C-5M aircrafts have already been delivered to the Air Force and are demonstrating increased operational capability. Current plans call for delivery of 52 fully modernized C-5M air lifters over the next seven years as we ramp up our work on this program. Modernization of these strategic airlift assets should extend the service life of the fleet through 2040. Turning to operational performance, our aeronautics team continues to retire development risk and expand their low rate initial production work on F-35 Joint Strike fighter program. Successful flight test milestones continue to be achieved on the conventional take-off and aircraft landing AA-1 including the 81st flight. It was the first flight conducted by an active duty marine pilot. Also this quarter, our BF-1 STOVL aircraft completed the 14th flight in conventional mode and the initial flight of our second STOVL aircraft known as the BF-2. The current test fleet has expanded to sixth aircraft, consisting of three flight aircraft and three static test aircraft. As anticipated this quarter, we received the updated engine from the government, which enabled the BF-1 STOVL aircraft to begin hover-pit testing in March.  To-date, the testing has progressed exceptionally well with the engine generating more vertical thrust than DoD performance requirements. We expect successful completion of hover test this March with the aircraft then proceeding to conventional mode flight test later this quarter followed by the first STOVL flight to be conducted this summer. These operational successes on the Joint Strike Fighter have increased confidence from domestic and international customers on the program's progress. Support of the progress maturity was shown by the Department of Defense first award of $305 million in contract for long lead materials for 32 aircrafts under LRIP Lot 4. Additionally, last week, we completed successful negotiation on LRIP Lot 3 contract for a total of 17 aircrafts consisting of 14 for the US and 3 for international customers. International support for the firm remains strong with the recent announced intention of the United Kingdom to purchase three test aircrafts and reaffirmation of it's commitment to purchase 138 STOVL aircraft. Also the Italian Parliament recently approved funds for the construction of the Final Assembly and Checkout facility. This facility is expected to become operational in 2013 to support in-country fabrication activities and will add to the collective capacity of the F-35 worldwide supplier base and production capabilities. Italy also reaffirmed its commitment to continue with its acquisition plan to purchase 131 aircraft for international requirements. Overall the F-35 program remains solidly on track as it ramps up production to meet the needs of our domestic and international customers for the fifth generation fighter aircrafts. Finally in Aeronautics, we are pleased with the recent ratification of a new-three year labor agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These employees perform critical task for our customer and the nation through their workup supporting our programs. This agreement is an essential element to workforce continuity and in our ability to move forward as we ramp up production on our F-35 aircraft line. Turning to our Space Systems segment, operational performance was demonstrated this quarter as they continued to build upon its legacy as the leading provider of GPS satellites. The Space Systems team completed fabrication of a modernized GPS satellite that was successfully launched for the US Air Force. This satellite is the seventh of eighth GPS IIRM satellites and will provide additional capacity and user access. These modernized satellites provide enhanced operations and navigation of signal performance for military and civilian users around the globe. The GPS constellation has become a main stay in our life by supporting a wide range of civil, scientific, commercial and military functions. With the award of the next-generation GPS 3 satellite constellation space systems last year, we are well positioned to continue our legacy of providing these critical access to US Air Force for decades to come. In summary, our operational accomplishments, new business wins and financial performance across all of our business segments this quarter have us well positioned for increased financial growth in 2009 and beyond. With a solid financial foundation and diversified portfolio, we look forward to continuing to create value for shareholders and customers. I would now like to open the line for your questions. Michael, please open the line please.
Operator:  (Operational Instructions). And we will take our first questions from Robert Springarn of Credit Suisse.
Robert Springarn - Credit Suisse:  Good morning, everyone.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Rob.
Robert Springarn - Credit Suisse: I have a lot of different things I would like to ask about, but the one thing I think a lot of us are focused on is the F-35 program and what happened on April 6? And Bruce, you alluded to that. Understanding that it doesn't affect fiscal '09, when I look at the puts and takes and what we saw on April 6, I see Lockheed in a net positive position largely because of F-35. Could you give us some specificity on what kind of increase we are actually looking at, what you know so far? A lot of this has been characterized as $5 billion plus, but it's really fiscal '09 to fiscal '10 that we see the $5 billion increment. What kind of increment do we see from what might have been the old 10 plan to the new ten plan, and how will that manifest itself in terms of spending, the number of test air craft they are adding versus other R&D.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes thanks Rob, long question, but a good question. Now quite honestly as we look at the F-35 program and what was announced by the Secretary, in terms of the actual aircraft quantities that with affect our next few years of planning, we honestly don't see increases to those numbers, I mean the numbers we were talking about in the FY-10 advance funding that we talked about, that I talked about in my script, was for 32 aircraft. I think that is right in line with what Secretary Gates mentioned in his comments on April 6th. The multi-billion dollar funding increase that you talked about, it is obviously something we noticed as well. It's not entirely clear to us at this point without the details of the budget, so exactly what that is for, at this point to be perfectly honest with you so, we are little bit waiting or maybe a lot waiting at this juncture to see what the details come out from, when they do come out later this month or early in next month to get more insight into the FY-10 budget to actually be able to answer that question.
Robert Springarn - Credit Suisse: Bruce is it fair to say though that if we look at what the accelerated plans that various people had proposed and they were numerous studies of an accelerated F-35 plan, that fiscal 10 was always going to be meaningfully above the 6 billion in fiscal '09. 
Bruce Tanner: That’s correct. 
Robert Springarn - Credit Suisse: Yes, okay so the delta is something other than that. Thank you very much.
Bruce Tanner:  You bet, Rob. 
Operator: And we will take your next question from Joseph Campbell with Barclays Capital.  
Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital: Hi, good morning. We wanted to ask the same kind of questions about either side. I guess somebody asked about the plus, less about the minuses. If they actually and the President’ helicopter and the F-22 program, what will actually happen say if we take the F-22 as an example, what will happen down in Marietta and how will that affect the other programs that are down there if the F-22 line actually ends.  And I guess the other question I have about the F-22 is, I read that the Secretary wants to do this, but traditionally that’s meant that Lockheed and the Air Force have gone over to the hill and rounded up letters from 50 senators or 100 senators or as many as you can get to try and reverse what the Secretary wants to do by wining on the helm if you are are loosing the Pentagon.  Are you still going to do that kind of battle to keep your plane sold or is this something that you have decided since the President and the Secretary don’t want it that you are going to leave them alone? 
Bruce Tanner: Well let me say whatever you came with Joe. We talked about the VH-71 and F-22 just the couple of maybe overarching comments before I get to the specific answer to that. Those are kind of two different discussions that were talked about in the Secretary’s words, I mean the F-22 it is not a termination, it's simply a lack of continuing production at the current level and actually the current program with the four additional aircraft to a total of 187 aircraft would take us out to about the first quarter of 2012 in terms of production of that program, the VH-71 is entirely different situation. And the words from the Secretary were basically that we are going to end that program, that would actually be a full blown termination. You asked about the impacts of that?  
Joseph Campbell - Barclays Capital: Does that mean you don't expect to get termination fees for the F-22 and so on? It's just no action taken that's your interpretation of what’s happening here? 
Bruce Tanner: We think Joe that there are tail-up costs which is kind of a little bit of term of aircrafts in the industry but there are tail-up costs associated with the end of any production line and we would expect that to be prevalent in the last four aircraft, as well as potential mode or change resulting in the overall recruitment of that tail-up cost for the end of the program. That’s different than a normal termination, say again the VH-71 where we have a pretty standardized process for terminations for convenience that reflect what costs are recoverable, which costs are not.  At this point, I think it's important to say though that there is nothing actionable on either one of those programs at this point. There is no notification, no letters from customers that would say you should perceive with the termination proposal if they are separate and telling us and what to do for instance with those assets. So, we are a little ahead of the game there as well.  You had asked about impact to Marietta and I will prove in the impact of Owego as well. Again the Marietta impact is further out in the 2012 timeframe. We are fortunate in Marietta and at the same time we are seeing the downturn in the F-22 production, we are seeing a significant up-tick in production for the C-130J program, as well as, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a fairly significant up-tick in production of C-5 program.  So, it remains to be seen if those things align perfectly to be able avoid any kind of issues there and we will have to take a look at things what elements of the F-35 program can be moved around between the aeronautics locations, but that’s something we will always strive to do to have as little disruptions as possible at Marietta workforce.  The Owego situation where the Presidential helicopter is built, a little different situation, there is no C-130J coming along behind it if you will, in Owego and that's something if that were to come to fruition along with the delay or the demise of the combat search and rescue helicopter, the CSAR-X program for the Air Force, that would likely have some near-term reductions on our Owego workforce that we are looking at as we speak here today. The last question you asked was about that we team up with Congress and try to the fight the F-22. Look, from my perspective the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, looking for that by I can go with the defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense and others within the Pentagon as well are all completely aligned on this matter from top to bottom, we had our chance to lobby this matter, we think we had a full hearing of that discussion, we are disappointed by the decisions but we will accept those and go on. 
Operator:  And we will take your next question from Robert Stallard of Macquarie.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital: Good morning.
Bruce Tanner:   Hello.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital: Bruce, if we can just follow on the same band if you could give us an update on the advance of the C-130J. It wasn't specifically commented I think on by Secretary Gates, but if you could update us on your volume increase there and the time table for that?
Bruce Tanner:   We still see, we are very much on-track and we seed up the fact that we are going to double production by the end of the decade. I am very comfortable with that statement as I sit here today. And we could see some potential growth beyond that and the years after the decade that would be our expectation. I think the Secretary actually made some nice comments. When he was speaking to some of the war college venues that he did after the announcement on April 6, where he talked about robust C-130J sales, which I think is affirmation of what we see in that regard as well Rob.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital:  Have you seen any interest on the export side of C-130J as well?
Bruce Tanner:  Absolutely. Internationally, I will say increased interest particularly with the couple of Middle Eastern countries and I think there has been additional inquiries. I think we are really in that regard but a couple of inquiries relative to what could happen relative to A400M's lack of success on the delivering aircraft with the time and dollars that they were putting to.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital:  Great, thank you.
Bruce Tanner:  Thank you, Rob.
Operator:  And we will next go to Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company:  Thank you very much.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Howard.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company:  I am good. It’s still morning. Good morning, gentlemen. The opportunities that exist before you extend not only in aeronautics but also I think in space and DNI Blair had some announcements the other day and talked about existing designs for some additional satellites. Does that position you pretty well for some volume growth in that market?
Bruce Tanner:  I think the short answer is yes, Howard, but the longer answer is probably not necessarily the near-term, but we saw the comments by Mr. Blair and were encouraged by them. This notion of the need for kind of these exquisite level satellites as there is something that we see as well and something that we are particularly well suited to produce. So, those align very nicely with our interest and past capabilities, but I don’t think it’s a near-term impact but it does set us up for a longer term growth, absolutely.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company:  And then just, if you look at all your programs you look like you are performing really well. Are there any areas where you feel like you have got maybe a couple of red programs and you like to highlight where there are some opportunities so far for some improvement?
Bruce Tanner: You know I probably never want to highlight red programs, but I will try to answer the question nonetheless. I think it was a very clean quarter and we really did not have any hiccups or pop-ups from a performance perspective. The programs that probably I'm watching, you know they are always characterized as having their reddish trance through them include several of the satellite programs while we are still in the developmental cycles. The MULOs program as well as potentially the current build on the AEHS satellites. I think we are making very good progress on both those. We have gone through a couple of interim tests particularly the AEHS satellites that have come out very favorably recently. So I'm encouraged by that. We have, I think I had mentioned a few quarters back a ground-based EW program within electronic systems that we had an issue with few quarters back. That’s still a locked item for us going forward and one we’re open to result here shortly.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Thank you very much Bruce. 
Bruce Tanner: Thanks Arnnet.
Operator: And the next question goes to Ronald Epstein with Merrill Lynch. 
Ronald Epstein- Merrill Lynch: Good morning again guys. 
Bruce Tanner: Good morning, Ron.
Ronald Epstein- Merrill Lynch: Bruce can you give us some color on the opportunities for the Lockheed Martin in cyber space, I mean in cyber security, I guess on the Wall Street journal there was a big picture of F-35 and talk about a cyber breach, how big an opportunity is it and what you guys bring into the space?
Bruce Tanner: Yeah great question, we saw the picture as well. Unfortunately can't talk a lot about nor does the US Government talk a lot about security matters, but nonetheless we actually believe the Wall Street journal was incorrect in its representation of a successful cyber attack on the F-35. I mean I’ve not heard of that to my knowledge and to our knowledge there has never been any classified information breach. And like the governments, these attacks on our systems are continuous and we do have stringent measures in place both to detect and stop these attacks. So, caught us a little bit by surprise there to be honest with you. As far the opportunity for Lockheed Martin, I think the opportunity is as rich as for anyone else kind of in this business. I think we have got great bonafides in terms of our past practices particularly as I look back on what we’ve done with a lot of the business and with our intelligence customers. So we probably had data encryption classified access all the programs for probably a quarter of a century with that customer. And I think that is the kind of protection that we are looking. This is not sort of anti-virus Internet protection sort of things you would buy going down to your computer retail store. This is very sophisticated, very redundant capabilities and I think that we provide and have provided for a number of years to a number of US government customers and I think that is nicely going forward. Size of the market I think, everyone describes it as in the billions of dollars, we describe it that way as well. Although, it is awfully hard to predict exactly how that market grows year-over-year, I do see it growing as faster than the DoD growth rate. And the hard part of that is from our perspective is we really do not get orders, change orders or contracts themselves to say put this cyber security application on the program, instead we get changes and programs that have requirements for like I said earlier redundancies and those sort of things that are just part of the normal costing of the program or that change order. So we currently don’t see, and we likely won't see the specific dollars associated with cyber security opportunities, but we do see that volume growing as we go forward.
Ronald Epstein- Merrill Lynch: Okay thanks Bruce.
Bruce Tanner: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JP Morgan.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Thanks good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Joe how are you?
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Good thanks. Bruce, if you could talk about the IS and GS business a little bit, the margins were a little lower than they have been over the past couple of years, edging below that 9% market. I think for the first time since '06 you did the re-organ and it wasn't quite clear from the MD&A here on the margin as to why they were lower. The decrease in civil was due to the absence of benefit. It doesn’t explain why you are down kind of overall?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, I got the question Joe, thanks. Yeah with margins within IS and GS for 8.8 last year was about 9.2. Last year had the benefit that we did mention on the call as well as the press release of the contract restructuring. That was a fairly significant item that if we remove that from 2008, 2009’s performance actually exceeds that, now taking a look at the absolute value if you will and your comment I think is right relative to comparing it back to 2006 time frame. Margins at the 8.8% level are lower than what we have done in the last two years. Couple of reasons for that, one of which is as I have talked about on numerous occasions, IS and GS has the largest percentage of what we call service contract accounting programs where we have great variability in the quarterly flow of those costs basically on service contract accounting your revenues is fairly levelized but your expenses or cost of sales associated with those contracts are expressed in the period which incurred. So depending on what you have won in the early stages of those service contract accounting, contracts you can have great fluctuation in the cost of sales recognized on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I think that’s what happened in the first quarter time frame. There were no performance issues, there was not a performance write-off in any of our programs, it was strictly the timing of that cost of sales recognition. Looking forward I still see we talked about in the past that IS and GS has the largest share of award fees of any of our four business areas and those award fees tend to get locked in the second and fourth quarter. We actually had a fairly low portion, we have to work these off in all four quarters, but we also had a little bit lower award fee portion in the first quarter compared to say years passed. And yet we still expect to see in the second and fourth, significant increases in the margin as we reflect the award fees that will be received in those two quarters. I still figure today looking out at the year confident in our guidance that we provided to you and I will share with you one another comment maybe before I let you go. You mentioned the '06 time frame, we are just going back and restating some of the history for IS and GS because of the reinstatement of the lines of business. You take a look at the 2006 earnings out of IS and GS compared to 2009 earnings and EBIT out of IS & GS it's up 50%. We have about $800 million of earnings in the 2006 time frame and $1.2 billion is what our outlook in the 2009 time frame. So I don’t think there’s anything to be ashamed about.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Yeah. Thank you very much. That’s very good color. And just on the reorg though what drove the timing I guess specifically?
Bruce Tanner: I think the timing was just driven by the fact that we have some significant growth in what was formally the global services line of business within IS and GS and we were starting to get some contract applications that were cutting across not just within the global services but in all three business areas and we are cutting across our customer base and we just felt that having this alignment more geared towards our customer set presented a more consistent phase to those customers, and it was actually easier for us to align our resources that way as well. Nothing more than that.
Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan: Got it, thank you.
Bruce Tanner: Thank you, Joe.
Operator: And our next question will go to Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Thank you very much. Secretary Gates talked about in-sourcing contract acquisition work, and bolstering government's workforce there. And we saw I guess a Bloomberg article about how the VA has in-sourced the VAT work from you and representative [inaudible] and is crowing about how they would save all this money. Could you comment on the VA, is that an isolated incident and related to kind of what Gates said, where do you see -- is in-sourcing really a threat and if so where and how much business do you have that might be subject to in-sourcing.
Bruce Tanner: Okay. First maybe a little correction, it’s called DFAS which is actually the payment office if you will for the Government in Columbus, Ohio there and the contract, you are talking about, and then bringing in what that announcement actually discussed with the fact that they would not be exercising the next option on that contract. That contract expires in the 2010 timeframe and the comment from the customer that they do not want to exercise the option past that timeframe. And we will support them in that endeavor and we will make sure the transition is seamless from our perspective. That particular one was a fairly small contract of say less than $50 million or so of annual sales actually quite a bit less than $50 million of annual sales.  The things, probably the broader question Cai, that you are asking about is, what does this portend for other programs that are similar ilk. And I think in general this, at the top level I would say A-76 programs that have recently been awarded are probably areas that will be scrutinized going forward. And we have a couple of contracts that probably fall in that category. The AFSS contract, the alternative flight station support contract out of IS&GS is one of them. And we also have just kind of call it two different things again, both the IHOP or the HR access program for the Department of Homeland Security. Those are ones that I will be watching going forward, because they were fairly recent awards. Most of the rest of our kind of support of customer, government customers for things like sustainment activities and so forth, I don't particularly see those at risk. I think we have got well established kind of ground rules, our boundaries stay between ourselves and the depots where we have a very, very comfortable working relationships, they are in fact a partnering relationship on many of our programs, and I don't see that changing going forward.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay, could you comment, Kucinich sort of has this combat of, or they wish growing up we are going to save so much money. Is this really kind of an isolated specific incident with politics, or if you see this as part of a broader, or is this kind of related to what Gates talked about?
Bruce Tanner:   I think by any measure that the customer used to evaluate us, we performed very well in that contract and I will leave with that.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator:  And our next question goes to Sam Pearlstein with Wachovia.
Sam Pearlstein - Wachovia Securities:  Good morning.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Sam.
Sam Pearlstein - Wachovia Securities:  Hi. This is kind of a multi-part question, but I am just wondering if you can talk a little bit about capital allocation. If I just look at what the stock hit in this first quarter and your buyback activity while you certainly bought back an awful lot of the stock really had been down below 60. I am just trying to think about the combination of your strength in your balance sheet what the stock prices have done, and then looking at your appetite for acquisition given current multiples. Can you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about capital as we go forward?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, good question, Sam maybe just to give a start of that, I will just talk about cash in general and I’ll start by playing the first quarter and we are really proud of the results in the first quarter $1.2 billion. Just like I'm probably as proud of if not more is the fact that our free cash flow exceeded $1 billion as well. And just to kind of give you a preview of what we are looking at in the next few years, our next few quarters, I think cash going forward will probably be somewhat levelized to get to the $4.1 billion probably each quarter about the $1 billion range, so I don't see huge fluctuations there. Relative to its deployment and its effect on the capital structure, we did 67% return on free cash flow in the first quarter that was lower than what we did in 2008. But in 2008, there were significantly greater numbers of options that were exercised. And as we tried to avoid or tried at that timeframe to avoid some of the share creep associated with those exercising options, we ended up buying a whole lot more shares in that quarter than this quarter. I will also remind everyone that first quarter of 2009, the dividend payouts or the dividend rates that we are paying out is 36% higher than was the dividend in the first quarter of 2008, and we look at cash back to shareholders in the forms of, both share purchases and dividends, so we went up on the dividend side significantly, but we came down a little bit in the share repurchase side. But even with that, I think we still reduced share count by 1.6% in the quarter, which is one of our highest quarters that we have ever done since we have had the share repurchase program. Going forward, I still think we are trying to keep powder a little dry from an acquisition perspective. From an opportunistic use of the cash, we continue to like the string of pearls approach we have used and we are still looking at those situations as we speak today.
Sam Pearlstein - Wachovia Securities:  But if it's the type of thing with the buyback we hear in the market everyday, or is it when the price presents an opportunity you are more aggressive?
Bruce Tanner: Well, the answer to that is yes. We are typically in the market everyday, but we try to accelerate when we think the price has not an opportunistic reason to buyback more shares. 
Sam Pearlstein - Wachovia Securities:  Okay. And then can I just ask a follow-on, the FAS/CAS adjustments, were there changes in assumptions that would have led to a $10 million shift in the last couple of months?
Bruce Tanner:  Yeah, good guess. The FAS/CAS did change 10 from when we talked to you in the January timeframe, and we've got 18 or so different pension plans and finally put together call we were still crunching on all the actuarial assumptions behind that, Sam. That happens every year about that time. Most years, I shouldn't say most years. Last year it didn't reflect the change in the first quarter when we presented results there. In prior years if you look back, we have actually had kind of similar levels of adjustments, but all of it was kind of trueing up for that actuarial data, nothing more significant than that.
Operator:  And we will take our next question from Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood -Morgan Stanley:  Good morning.
Bruce Tanner: Hi, Heidi.
Heidi Wood -Morgan Stanley:  First, a big picture question for you and then another couple of specifics from the quarter. You guys were the first to focuse in the shift from defense to talking about global security, but I am wondering what you think that mean from a numerical perspective. I mean what does this portend for margins or do you see revenues growing faster. And I better want to understand if we take a look at this status smart power, cyber security, healthcare, IT and energy as future growth opportunities, how big are they collectively and how fast do you see them growing? I am sure you can't give us number for cyber security, but if it is part of a overall group that does thrust of growth, perhaps you can give us color that way.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, Firstly, big picture. I think those prospects for the four items that we talked about in the prepared remarks is for some potential for some significant growth, although again probably not in the immediate near-term. I think the one that probably has the quickest near-term growth potential is in the cyber security, I wish I could give more detail as to why that is, but really just can't at this point in time.  The other ones that we are watching along that ilk, again I think the health care IT is one that is implemented the way things are being talked about. We have some great opportunities there. And that could be a near-term revenue growth item than say the energy business. The energy is still kind of in its nascent point right now still starting from not much, but we do see great potential in that area. And the US about margins going forward, it's a little bit too early to tell at this time, I would think that the cyber security margins would be comparable to the rest of our DoD business. I would think that the healthcare IT would be comparable to what we experienced on other federal IT programs, so I don't see it necessarily increase or decrease in those margins going forward.
Heidi Wood -Morgan Stanley:  But the collection of the four, including Smart Power, how would you band with their size now, so we can watch this expand?
Bruce Tanner:  Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't mention Smart Power. That's the one we think will grow. I didn't mention that earlier. That probably will grow as fast or faster than the other two as well, and that will probably in all honesty has margins that are a little bit lower than the overall margins of the rest of the business areas. And pretty in particular within IS&GS. Again Heidi, I think it's just difficult to quantify that near-term, I think other than saying cyber, healthcare IT and Smart Power for the near-term chances to have some revenue growth and at least on the cyber and the Smart Power those have potential for significant near-term.
Heidi Wood -Morgan Stanley:  All right, and then as it pertains M&A, it seems that most of the M&A we have seen you do has been expanding on this global security paradigm, does that continue or do you think that there is some opportunities to add more of the core over in 2009?
Bruce Tanner: I think you will see some core acquisitions as I just looked out over the horizon of what we are looking at. I think there is some very, very promising core items that we are pursuing, but quite honestly in terms of what we have done in the past, and while we still see opportunities within the IS&GS sorts of business because that is our hurdle ground, we believe and we continue to think that's a hurdle going forward. Also an area going forward is the sustainment part, and we still see some benefit in potentially doing some acquisitions in that area as well.  
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will go next to Myles Walton of Oppenheimer and Company. 
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer and Company: Thanks, good morning guys. 
Bruce Tanner:  Hi Myles. 
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer and Company: We touched on the Secretary Gates comments on the topping of the 22 or 187, but what I was curious on is your perspective on the upgrade potential of the existing aircraft or the first hundred to bring them upto 2.2 increment. And do you think, or do you have a read yet on his desire to put that full effort behind which I guess on Young’s comments late last year were put around $8 billion or so? 
Bruce Tanner: Maybe just a couple of comments on the F-22 just to set the stage. I think we continue to have in my words just exceptional cost and schedule performance along with record quality levels on that program and that’s in the midst of all the churn and turmoil and discretion has been flying around the programs head at that point in time. So, I am very happy with the performance that we are seeing even in the face of a lot of the discussions were going on. You talked about the potential for and I would characterize it as sustainment, mods upgrades for the program. We see those things literally that aircrafts will be flying for decades to come and the need for sustainment, the need for modification, the need for upgrades with this aircraft is just as with any other aircraft will also continue for decades. That won't change simply because the aircraft is out of production. We see that the numbers that you mentioned Secretary Young’s comments, we see those as being very viable, very feasible and I think we are literally talking multiple billions of dollars in mods and upgrades that need to be done for the aircrafts over the next five to ten years. 
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer and Company: Okay. And so would you expect those to kind of feather into 2010-2011 such that the wind down of the I guess percentage of completion basis, that would probably effect you in the later part of 2010, you wouldn’t really see much of a decline on overall F-22 in 2010 and maybe you start to see it in '11.
Bruce Tanner: Yes, I don't think so, because as we look at it right now, we probably do about a $1 billion a year in kind of sustainment cost on the F-22 program as we speak today, that number is likely to grow. And I am not sure it grows in the timeframe you are looking at enough to offset kind of the planned reduction in the production aircraft, but beyond 2012, I think that’s where we will see a lot of the mod upgrade effort that you were talking about, but I was referring to as well take place, and that will help mitigate some of that reduction in my judgment.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer and Company: Okay. That’s fair. And the last one from me, CAS I think your mark date is in May and so would you actually have almost at this point good visibility into what your 2010 CAS projection would be?
Bruce Tanner: I wish I could say yes, Myles, but the answer is no. There is still a lot of thing, the things are going on and I heard you chuckle there, but the things that are going on literally is, I can see what the assets return is right now, no great secret here I don't think we are fairly flat as far as the asset returns is concerned not tracking with the 8.5% for the year if you will. But on the other hand, the discount rate if we were to strike a line in the sand today, that discount rate is significantly higher than what we had at the end of the year last year, that’s more on the FAS side I guess, as opposed to CAS. But we still got another what 3.5 or so months of performance on the asset side. Still too early to call for what the CAS is going to be without the passage of those two months or so.
Operator: And our next question goes to Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs:  Hi, good morning.
Jerry Kircher:   Good morning. 
Bruce Tanner:  Good morning. How are you, Noah?
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Good. In the tactical vehicle world, you guys are part of the JLTV down select, but there is always a conjecture of that being sort of pushed to the right. Is there any opportunity for you to get involved in what might happen between now and then we've got, MATV out there, there's now discussion of ECV-2 where the sole source was taken away. So, what's your latest thinking on timing of JLTV and is there an opportunity for you to be involved in what might happen between now and then?
Bruce Tanner:   Yes thanks. I think the short answer to the question is, we are engaged in the JLTV competition, that’s the 27 month tech demo phase and it is likely that there won’t be opportunities for us to get into the tactical vehicle market other than that entry if you will.
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Okay. One quick follow-up, the revenue growth in the quarter is lower than what the full year guidance implies for the full-year. So, you are expecting some acceleration. Can you just give us the two or three things that drive that and kind of help us with the quarterly profile for the last nine months of the year?
Bruce Tanner:   Yes that’s a good question, given what we did in the first. Maybe what I will do, spend a little more time than maybe, you are expecting, let me answer that question but I will kind of go through each of the four business areas maybe just the center stage. IS&GS growth of 10%, looking forward I will expect to see revenue growth within IS&GS sequentially increasing quarter-over-quarter and still within the numbers that we are looking at for the full-year guidance. I don’t see anything it would cause us to back off of that assumption.  Within Electronic Systems, this is the one that might be a little bit of surprise to you listening there as we look into the second quarter, the second quarter last year for Electronic Systems was the highest quarter of the year, and that was driven by significantly higher deliveries in that particular quarter for air defense products as well as tactical missile products. We don’t see that same level of sales recognition in the second quarter of 2009 timeframe. In fact, I would expect to see a reduction quarter-over-quarter in electronic systems in the second quarter simply because of the lack of those delivery items this year versus last year. After second quarter in electronic systems, we expect to see accelerating growth with each of the last two quarters growing at fairly good eclipse for the rest of the year still getting to the level we talked about in the guidance obviously. Within the Aeronautics business area, we were down slightly in the first quarter here. We had one F-16 delivery less than we had in the previous year. We are also holding it lighter on the F-22 volume and even though we had increased volume as a little lighter than we were expecting on the F-35. I think those are pure kind of timing issues that will resolve themselves in the next three quarters. Same quarter situation is IS&GS strong sequential revenue growth quarter-over-quarter getting to the level we saw in the guidance.  And then just talking with some color on Space. Space I would expect to be down from a comparable basis relative to last year’s second quarter. Last year’s second quarter had two delivery events, one launch vehicle and one satellite, a commercial satellite and a commercial launch vehicle that we don’t expect to have happen this year. So, that in it of itself will break out the second quarter to be lower. And then from that point forward space is probably going to have fairly flattish growth, probably the fourth quarter being the highest quarter of the year as we look there.  Also within Aeronautics I should make the point that the quantity of aircrafts were up 3 aircrafts on the F-16 production line and up 4 aircrafts on the C-130J production line. Interestingly, for both of those programs all the increase in aircrafts occurred in the second-half of the year. So, overall we are going to see probably a lower second quarter than a lot of people are expecting and then probably more rapid growth in second-half of the year that people are expecting as well. 
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: As I plug those in while you are saying and it looks like the second quarter growth rate will actually be lower than the first quarter growth rate and then 3Q and 4Q will be in the double-digits. 
Jerry Kircher:  Yes, I think the second quarter growth rate will be
Bruce Tanner: I think you said it right. I think you have got it right. 
Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot. 
Bruce Tanner: You bet.
Operator: And our next question goes to Douglas Harned of Sanford Bernstein
Douglas Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning 
Bruce Tanner: Hi Dough 
Douglas Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Hi, I wanted to ask a question on electronics and just to understand really from a margin standpoint you highlighted two things in the release, one was a one-time item on the resolution of stimulation and training contract. And then also some declines in the quarter in MS-2, could you sort of scale those and in the MS-2 side, is this something that’s really just a one-time a timing issue for the quarter and how do you see that going forward over the rest of the year?
Bruce Tanner: Yes, couple of responses to that, one we highlighted in the press release we did, as you said kind of a one-time contract resolution/settlement in our stimulation training business in Orlando. We think of that in the tens of millions of dollars but that drove Electronic System's margins in the first quarter higher than probably what we are going to experience for the rest of the year without some sort of unplanned performance improvements in the remainder of the year if you will.  So, as you said, that was kind of the one-time event, you also talked about the MS-2 that was I will say kind of seasonally lower in the first quarter than probably we are going to see for the rest of the year. There are couple of, just talk about the revenue there was a number of deepwater aircraft deliveries, the so called MPA aircraft that happened in the first quarter of last year. That brought the revenue down a little bit, but the margins were also slightly less than what we expect for the rest of the year. I think that's more of a seasonal thing than anything else, Dough.
Douglas Harned – Sanford Bernstein:   Because you should be seeing good growth overtime in that unit I would expect? 
Bruce Tanner: And we would as well. I should point out that within the Electronic Systems, we expect all three of the lines of business there, the MS-2, missiles and fire controller and platform training to have double-digit return on sales and that's consistent with what we are out looking to you.
Douglas Harned – Sanford Bernstein:   Okay. Great. Thank you.
Bruce Tanner:
 : Thank you, Doug. 
Jerry Kircher:  Michael, this is Jerry, I think we got time for one more call.
Operator:  Okay. And our last question will come from Jim McIlree of Collins Stewart.
Jim McIlree - Collins Stewart: Thank you very much. This will be easy all my questions have been asked and answered.
Bruce Tanner:   Okay, great Jim. Thank you. Okay. With that I would like to offer some closing comments. Looking forward it is essential that we continue our efforts to execute on program and deliver the best value solution to our customers. The future budget environment and change in customer priorities will require continuous focus on cost efficiencies and program performance. Our 146,000 employees have us uniquely positioned to deliver on these requirements and differentiate Lockheed Martin in the eyes of shareholders and customers. I would like to close by thanking you for your questions and for joining the call today; and we look forward to talking to you again in July. Michael, that concludes our call. 
Operator: And this does conclude today's Lockheed Martin conference call. Thank you for joining us and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Corporation fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Jerry Kircher: Good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Bob Stevens, our Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our web site which supplement our comments today. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Stevens: Good afternoon everyone. I hope you've all had an opportunity to read today's earnings release and our updated 2009 guidance. As the release outlined, our internal operational performance continued at a very high level and enable the corporation to achieve record 2008 results in virtually every key financial metric. Our focus, operational tempo, quality and overall execution remain very strong.  However, the release also shows the impact external factors have had on our financial outlook. The market decline and the value of securities and the reduction in discount rates used to calculate our pension earnings have negatively impacted our 2009 earnings per share guidance. The subject of pension accounting as an impact on our financial results is important to you, it's important to us, and a key area of our discussion today, and I've asked Bruce to provide some additional clarity and depth on pensions later on during the call. In these times of unprecedented market turmoil, economic uncertainty and falling discount rates, at a time when it seems so difficult to make almost any judgments about the future, I want to focus my comments today on the current state of our corporation and our framework for future performance. Ralph Heath and his aeronautics team have been performing at an exceptional level across their portfolio. On our largest program, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we continue to retire risk on the development effort. The conventional and the short take off and vertical landing aircraft are progressing well through their flight test programs. The Carrier version design and development is moving forward on schedule and integration and verification of the Mission System suite continues to parallel on our cooperative avionics test bed aircraft. This airplane continues to yield huge risk reduction benefits as we hoped it would. Production activities in Fort Worth are accelerating with all development aircraft and now the first low rate initial production aircraft in assembly. International partner participation remains solid and we're seeing additional interest by non-partner nations. By all measures this program remains solidly on track to provide fifth generation, multi-role stealth fighter capability to meet the needs of domestic and international customers for decades to come. Each of our large aircraft production programs, the C-130J, the F16 and the F22 secured new domestic or international awards that enabled all three to extend their production lines. Our C-130J program won new orders from India, Qatar, and the U.S. Government, solidifying production through December 2012. To accommodate new orders, we're working to double our current annual production rate; 12 to 24 aircraft in 2010. With the versatility, value and proven performance of the C-130J we've gained the confidence of our customers and we believe the future market remains bright. The F16 program again added to the list of international customers with a new contract from Morocco. 24 countries have now chosen the F16 and this contract extended the production line through December 2012. Our F22 Raptor program continued to demonstrate extraordinary manufacturing performance in 2008. With the fabrication of aircraft that are meeting the very highest standards of quality, delivered on schedule and on budget. We recently received funding for four additional aircraft under Lot 10 that extends the production line through February 2012. The decision as to whether to extend the program with additional aircraft orders will be made early this year after discussions are completed along with the Department of Defense, the Congress and the Obama administration, and we'll keep you advised. As I think of our Space Systems business, I'm enormously proud of [Joanne McGuire] and her team, having won both the GPS3 and [Gozar] competitions. These wins are a direct measure of our world class expertise in next generation satellite systems and extend our foundation for years to come. We're honored to be trusted as a partner providing these mission critical navigation and weather solution to the United States Air Force and to NOA. Operationally, our Space segment also performed flawlessly on the successful Phoenix Mars Lander mission which captured world attention, and the extension of free ballistic missile successes to 125 consecutive launches. I was particularly pleased with the sales growth rate and the new business win performance in our Information Systems and Global Services business. Linda Gooden's IS&GS team has led the corporation in top line sales growth since the business area was formed in 2007 and they continued that leadership position in 2008. Their win rate was exceptional on new business awards and enabled them to close the year with a record backlog that is reflective of clear and compelling value delivery to customers. These wins resulted in an organic growth rate of 13% and solidly positions the business for strong sales growth in the future. The program execution and performance of how focused a hall mark of the corporation, our team continually works to redouble our efforts on any programs where we might be falling short of customer expectations for any reason. As we entered 2008, we had some challenging programs that required additional efforts to achieve mission success. Those programs included Java, the Littoral combat ship and the V871 Presidential helicopter. Great credit to due Chris Kubasik and his electronic systems team who have been working jointly and effectively with our customers by focusing on program execution. Together, we identified and implement actions that have significantly improved each of these programs. I'm proud of their efforts to restore customer satisfaction. On Java, we implemented reliability improvements that achieved recertification of the program and new production awards. On the Littoral combat ship, we completed sea trials that demonstrated unequaled speed, maneuverability and capabilities on the first ship of this new class of naval vessel. The maturity and performance of the ship resulted in commissioning by the United States Navy in November. In December, I had the unique opportunity to ride aboard Freedom from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland to its birth in Norfolk, Virginia.  My conversations with the captain and crew reinforced a universal level of enthusiasm for this ship and its capabilities and I couldn't be prouder of the team that produced this transformational vessel. We look forward to providing additional ships to the Navy to satisfy their 55 ship LCS requirement.  We also continue to have meaningful and ongoing discussions with international where expressions of interest in our ship remain high. The V871 Presidential helicopter program continues to make progress on increment one with all aircraft meeting or exceeding key performance parameters. We await a customer decision on increment two and the future production of these important assets for our nation. Our focus on program execution means meeting our commitments to customers by completing key milestones on time and on budget while continuously improving quality and focusing on affordability. Our improved actions on these programs demonstrate our strong willingness and ability to work with our customers to correct shortfalls in program execution and get the acquisition right. I'm encouraged with our progress in expanding our footprint in adjacent markets. I'm very pleased with our recent selection as one of the winning teams on the joint flight tactical vehicle technology demonstration competition. We believe our test vehicle experience, customer intimacy and innovative designs will be a tremendous differentiator in the future production competition. In our ongoing M&A activities, we completed the acquisition of Universal Systems and Technology earlier this month and have included them in our 2009 outlook. Unitek provides interactive training and simulation solutions to DOD and international customers. They'll be managed within our electronic systems business and will extend our capabilities and relationship and support growing customer demand for operational readiness and training solutions. With our long standing focus on expanding our international presence to new customers, 2008 achieved significant progress towards that goal. We successfully won a long term contract in Canada to modernize the Halifax Class Navy Frigate and its missile defense. We secured the first sale in the Middle East of the Pac 3 Missile defense system with a contract award from the United Arab Emirates. These diverse awards demonstrate the broad spectrum of our product offerings and our ability to bring value to new international customers.  Moving beyond our operational and new business performance, we've been working hard to attract new hires and develop our work force. We continue to shape a high performance culture at Lockheed Martin by focusing on our values, strengthening diversity and inclusion, insisting on high standards for ethical conduct, and reinforcing our principals of full spectrum leadership. For the third year in a row, Lockheed Martin was ranked by Business Week Magazine as one of the top 10 places to launch a career. The sustained recognition that Lockheed Martin is a desirable and valuable place to work continues to fuel the inflow of more than one million resumes in 2008 and enabled our company to hire over 13,000 new employees. If we work to help our customers meet their current and future challenges, it is essential that we build a team that consists of the very best leaders and finest professional talent. World class personnel provides the skills that will enable us to raise the bar. Our operational and financial performance can build upon our momentum in delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders. Looking into 2009, we anticipate that revenues will rebound strongly above 2008 levels with solid growth of approximately 6%. Segment operating profit is projected to exceed $5 million in 2009 positioning us to achieve that goal that established with you on last January's call. Cash flow generation is expected to remain about $4 billion and provide opportunities for further disciplined cash deployment.  In November of 2005, we discussed with you for the first time, our strategy to become the world's premier global security company. This evolution was based on our assessment of the global security environment which we saw as growing much more complex and dynamic. The very sense and definition of security for us had been changing. Certainly, including traditional military preparedness, but expanding further into more effective counter-terrorism and intelligence capabilities, international cooperation requiring more inter-operable systems, humanitarian, peacekeeping and stability operations, homeland security and critical infrastructure protection, improved service levels with civil government agencies, more affordable logistics and sustainment and a far more expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solutions while providing vastly improved levels of network and cyber security. We were confident we had the skills, experience and global presence to make meaningful and valued contributions across this broader horizon. Accordingly, we've been repositioning the company, growing our portfolio, diversifying the business, adding focus on core defense capabilities and electronics, aeronautics and space, while expanding systems integration skills into adjacent markets that allow us to add more value for example in surface navel vessels, rotary wing aviation and land vehicles. You may recall in 2006 we purchased Pacific Architects and Engineer, a company with capabilities that now align very well with emerging expectations for homeland security and the application of Smart Power. We committed to higher levels of international growth which we're positioned to achieve and we made disciplined acquisitions and investments to reinforce our market presence and skills in the information sciences domain. Why? Because expanded access to continuous high quality situational awareness will remain essential in assuring clarity and reducing uncertainty in today's environment. The very need for this increased situational awareness will drive the linkage to the increasing robust communications systems, advanced sensing devices and the computers that control them. This capability will enable the meaningful sharing of information and networks will continue to grow in power and importance to accommodate these new linkages. The criticality of network security will become even more acute, resulting in increased demands for cyber security and encryption security solutions. We are confident that our strategy and the world's premier global security company is the correct one. We're committed to building upon the leadership position we've established by setting high expectations, reinforcing our culture, building on world class talent and making smart and disciplined investments. Let me next turn to an outlook for the U.S. Defense spending. The 2009 budget provided mid single digit growth above prior year levels and solid funding for our major programs. The current outlook for the fiscal '10 budget is project to provide a growth of about 2% to 3% over 2009 levels.  Despite this growth rate, we continue to believe that our revenue growth will exceed the overall BOD growth rate driven by strong expansion in our F-35 program and information technology sales. We expect continued growth in our core and adjacent markets for both domestic and international customers as we broaden our portfolio and remain committed to excellence in execution. Before to turning to your questions, I'd like to turn the call over now to Bruce to provide some additional detail on pension accounting, cash deployment and capital structure.
Bruce Tanner: Before I begin the discussion of pensions, I wanted to briefly reinforce Bob's earlier comment about our 2008 record financial performance. By any measure, 2008 reflects the strongest financial performance in the Lockheed Martin history. Our record backlog of almost $81 billion was achieved by all four business areas growing their backlog throughout the year. In cash from operations we generated a new all time high of over $4.4 billion. We expanded operating segment margins by 40 basis points to 11.6% and achieved record return on invested capital of 21.7%. Based on our continuing operational performance, we increased the 2009 sales and operating segment profit guidance at our January outlook. As you've seen, these operational increases were more than offset by the negative pension impact of approximately $0.70 to the 2009 earnings per share guidance we provided in October. The primary driver for the change was the large and rapid reduction in interest rates, particularly in the later part of December that resulted in a reduction in indices we use to determine the discount rate to value our pension liabilities. These indices declined between 130 and 150 basis points from our prior outlook, leading to reduction in our discount rate from 7.5% to 6.8%. The return on our pension assets on the other hand, finished the year much closer to the performance at the time of the call with a negative return of just under 28% for the year. While our CAS process for 2009 were unaffected by these changes, our FAS estimates for expected in 2009 grew by $410 million, resulting in a change to our GAP earnings per share. I think it's important to remember that in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations that govern how we cost and are reimbursed on our contracts, it is our cash cost estimates that drive our cash requirements and note of profitability, not our FAS expense. Looking forward, future pension funding obligations will be determined by a RINSA level in accordance with the Pension Protection Act. As you know, large defense contractors were exempted from the PPA funding requirements until the planned cash amortization projected to occur in either 2010 or 2011. The effect of the cash amortization will be to accelerate cash expenses and recovery to better align with the accelerated thresholds required by the PPA. To help demonstrate this significant annual differences that occur in FAS and CAS expenses, we've included a web chart today that outlines the history of these two expense lines since the creation of Lockheed Martin in 1995. While the chart shows the annual variability that occurred between FAS and CAS values, it also shows that the cumulative variance is relatively insignificant. FAS recognizes expense impact faster than CAS. CAS expense will lag FAS to enable the government funds to be appropriated, contracts to be negotiated and costs to be recovered on government contracts. This variability in timing of FAS and CAS results in large annual swings, the result of non cash impact to earnings. The same factors that led to the FAS expense increase in 2009 also contributed to the reduction of equity described in our press release. I will point out that the equity change has no impact on our debt covenants and we continue to have less than $250 million of debt repayments required for the year 2012. In the area of cash management, we ended 2008 with over $2 billion cash on our balance sheet and project continued strong cash generation in 2009 of greater than $4 billion. These strong cash levels will enable us to continue to implement our cash deployment strategy. We remain committed to returning at least half of our annual free cash flow to shareholders.  We have over $2 billion in share repurchase authority outstanding. We continue to make opportunistic purchases to return cash to shareholders and eliminate share creed. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first call comes from Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs.
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs: I had a question on pensions. I understand your remarks Bruce of FAS/CAS impacting the income statement, but I just wanted to ask you about regarding cash contributions. You pre-funded in the fourth quarter but I did want to know if you could us any comment on what you think cash contributions are likely to be in 2009.
Bruce Tanner: The pre-fund that we did in 2008, at the end of 2008 should take care of our funding requirements for all of 2009. The only thing that could tweak that a little bit is if some of bargain units make some changes in negotiations that would result in a requirement to fund some of those changes. In any event, I wouldn't see that impacting our cash guidance that we provided to you.
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs: If I look at your guidance, it seems to be implying flat segment operating margins, so my question is you seem to be, in deference to the remarks you were making earlier, you seem to be retiring risk on a number of programs. You seem to be guiding to flat segment margins. This leads me to think there's some other pressures in 2009. I saw where you're coming from space. So if you think I'm correct, I'm wondering if also you could tell me where you think the upside would be to margins.
Bruce Tanner: If we take a look at space, I think part of the biggest change that we see going on there is just a slightly lower level of ULA, the equity earnings associated with that. There's also some growth occurring within the Orion contract on our space transportation, the government portion there. That's growing at a lower level, so that's more of a mix issue than anything else. I think electronic systems is fairly constant at 13%. We're guiding actually aeronautics up slightly and IS&GS is also up slightly about a tenth of a percent. We see opportunity. The thing that I always like to say at the start of a year is, I think we have the same sorts of planning at the start of 2009 as we had at 2008, and out of those risks and opportunities are relinquished and put to bed but we have some upside potential there, but they have to be done throughout the year, and we'll obviously status you that as we update you every quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus: I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the adjacent markets. You've had a pretty good job of expanding into helicopters, ships, ground combat vehicles, but is there any other adjacent markets that you're trying to target for 2009, 2010, or do you just kind of penetrate deeper into some of these markets that you're already in?
Robert Stevens: I think a little of both. I think we see there can well be some opportunities in those areas where we have starts previously. For example, as a follow on to the technology demonstration segment of JLPV would be a development and production program, so we're going to evolve our design and put forward our best concepts that we're quite excited about, and I think we could see some market expansion there. I think we've also defined a little broader aperture for what is adjacent. We thing there should be and really needs to be considerable opportunities in operation and maintenance and sustainment. If we look at the overall Defense budget in the areas where that budget has been growing and we frankly look at the relative approach to providing logistics and support, it's not a very modern information based, knowledge determined process. And we think by adding better systems architectures here and adding better knowledge, we won't push so much inventory as much as selectively pull it and provide it to where it's needed. Think of it in terms as though we were talking about our business of producing work and profits inventory. What we think is there are lots of opportunities to align the supply chain, reduce that end process inventory and have a much more evolved, much more sophisticated, much more affordable and lower cost and highly predictable logistics and sustainment business, and that is a huge market aperture. So some of the logistics will follow if you will our programs and some of it won't but we've made a decided effort to expand our business in that respect. I think we define segments of the information technology market as adjacencies, and here again, I believe that to be a fairly broad market segment in which to work. We have not spoken the last words about the need for cyber security, and I alluded to that in my earlier remarks. It will become an increasingly critical aspect of every action the U.S. Government undertakes on inter-agency coordination or data sharing. It's so very clear to so many that a real strength is in the knowledge that can be gained by sharing information rather than sequestering information and when that happens, you have to be a trusted person who can get access to the network and assure that the networks are not overly vulnerable. We think we will grow substantially there. I think we may have mentioned in conversations an interest in overall health care, but where they focus on information technology. As we've broken down the cost, particularly in the escalating cost of health care, there is a lot of relatively low value expense because we don't have very sophisticated technology capability that can move information around and provide simply a better catalogue of your medical history and move that to the right position at the right time. We think we can make a contribution there. Lastly, and may a little more embryonic, we're looking at the overall energy marketplace particularly with a view on how we can use our analytical skills to determine better ways to conserve energy, and we're seeing some real interest there. From the size of our business, it's relatively small today, but we think there will be continued efforts this year and we want to participate in that aspect of the market as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Springarn – Credit Suisse.
Robert Springarn – Credit Suisse: Moving to NASA, with Mike Griffin gone at this point, having stepped down, do you want to see the shuttle program expanded, and there's a part two to that question. How do you feel about the EELV potentially as a substitute for the Aries launch vehicle?
Robert Stevens: On shuttle expansion, I think it depends on what time span anybody wants to apply for a future ride. I think that probably everybody that I have ever spoken with recognizes the shuttle is a design from years ago that has been falling though its design life and it's very near retirement. I don't know if that retirement is going to be in three, five or eight years, but it's very near retirement. So when you think of a long term national interest and commitment to space programs, particularly human space flight, I think we're all compelled to think about what's next. I'm sure that the incoming administration will be very wise and careful in their evaluation of the allocation of resources. How much of a scare resource should be put in to sustaining the system that exists versus how much in developing the new system? Of course I think we're making very good progress on the Orion program and I think that will certainly be taken into consideration when we think about the future long term strategy toward U.S. and human space flight. This notion of the use of an EELV launch vehicle instead of the Aries launch vehicle has been evaluated very thoroughly by NASA, and in my participation in those evaluations, the leadership of NASA has felt strongly and compellingly that the Aries launch vehicle provided the most flexibility and the most performance and that the human rate and EELV was not an inexpensive or easy thing to do. So we've seen that data. We understand that data, and we support that overall program approach to designing, building and flying out the Aries launch vehicle. But I must say, I applaud the incoming administration for a desire to look broadly, to examine programs, to examine resources that are available and how to best allocate those resources and whether priorities ought to change. What we want to do is participate fully, openly and transparently in talking about exactly where the programs of interest to us are, how well we're doing on them and certainly be available to answer any questions they have.
Robert Springarn – Credit Suisse: Just a clarification, or really a question for Bruce on capital spending, our understanding is that a majority of the growth in the Air Force in the fiscal '10 budget is an acceleration of R&D for F-35 plus possibly that OSD may accelerate annual production by that 27 units per year of F-35 focusing on the C-call variant probably staring fiscal '11? And I wanted to ask Bruce, what kind of capital spending does your current plan anticipate? Would you have to fund some of that acceleration yourself, and when would that start?
Bruce Tanner: I think the short answer to your question is at the funding levels that we have planned today for the next few years of F-35 productionization or facilitization at our Fort Worth facility, it has enough capacity within the funding levels that we are talking about to make those stepped up production levels that you're talking about. Incrementally, I would not expect to see any substantive increase to the capital expenditures than we already have planned in our current outlook.
Operator: Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr – Cowan & Company.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowan & Company: Could you give us a firm backlog at year end in units for the C-130J and the F16's and comment a little bit on your highest probability of international order potentials over the next year?
Bruce Tanner: You said F16's and C-130?
Cai von Rumohr – Cowan & Company: Correct.
Bruce Tanner: F16's at the end of the year, we had a backlog of 103 aircraft. On the C-130J line we had a backlog of 86 aircraft. I'll throw our my conjecture as to what the likely candidates are for growing that and I'll let Bob fill in any details that I've missed. The F16, I think we've talked in the past, near term events there's a Romanian buy potentially. There is a Taiwan buy and I think the Romanian buy is 12 to 24 aircraft, Taiwan more in the 66 aircraft number. But the longer objective down the road of course is the India competition for the MMRCA which is 126 aircraft. And we still believe there is an opportunity to sell some within the Middle East. Maybe somewhat surprisingly to you, we think there's some additional sales potential, not additional but new sales to Iraq, and there's potential for additional sales to the government of Egypt. So those are probably again in the 12 to 24 aircraft, the later two I would say. Relative to the C-130's, really we've got large numbers of domestic C-130's that are still yet to be placed on order with us. Internationally there is still a number of I'll say Middle Eastern countries that are looking to replace not huge quantities, but a few here or there. Israel is particularly one that could buy between four and six I believe. Australia is probably in the four's or so of their consideration. But the biggest opportunity that we face that we have the opportunity to achieve in C-130 sales is actually the U.S. government going forward.
Robert Stevens: Just a sort of simple thought, on the F16 program, let me say it this way, I think demand is obviously narrow, but there are 24 countries that fly the airplane. Bruce highlighted this specific area. It is possible because 24 countries and air forces buy the airplane there could be some replenishment or replacement aircraft that would unfold over the next few years. But as I said, it's a contained universe we think on the F16 other than those campaigns that Bruce highlighted. That world is very different on the C-130. It is a very broad global market where overall for priority on airlifts is huge, and there is no better proven tactical air lifter on the planet than the C-130J. It's met all its performance parameters. The customers who have it are hugely pleased with its overall performance, and I would cite, you know it's hard to develop these kinds of airplanes and insert them into tactical operations. We're probably seeing part of that story unfold with the A400M which was intended to compete for part of the market segment that a C-130 would have. So given just the high performance nature of the airplane, the great interest in assuring that each country can contribute to the mission, the difficulties that other potential competitors are having in the market segment, I think we're going to see broad and even a resurgent strength in C-130 interest.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowan & Company: On the Rabbi Trust, you had a large loss last year. Could you tell us the size of the trust, the asset allocation and whether losses and gains are tax deductible or not?
Bruce Tanner: I think for Rabbi Trust you add all the pieces and somewhere in there, it's a little bit north of $.5 billion, in the $500 million to $600 million range. Asset allocation I would say is very similar to what we have in our defined benefit Master Retirement Trust, not a whole lot different than what we experienced there. As far as the tax deductible, in particular for the Rabbi that occurred in 2008, those are primarily unrealized losses and at this stage they are not deductible.
Operator: Your next question comes from Douglas Harned – Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned – Sanford Bernstein: You've painted a very positive picture in terms of the outlook for the company. If you look out the next three years, what would be the three things you would see as the largest risk to performance, and how are you spending your time? How are you focusing you time these days when you consider that?
Robert Stevens: That is where I focus most of my time and most of my attention. We have got to execute against the commitments that we make to our customers and we have to do that every day on every program. That's a commitment that we make and we take that commitment very seriously. There are programs that we are engaged in now that to us either have operational or strategic significance in addition to having very considerable customer significance. Obviously the F-35 program falls into that category. Because it is a program that will be used by three services in the United States, eight partner countries today and we think the long term potential of that program is about to exceed the potential that we've seen in the F16 program. So very obviously getting that right is important. But we also have sufficient resources in the corporation to make sure that we get other programs right. I personally am excited about the Littoral Combat Ship. I have ridden on this ship. I've stood on the deck at 47.2 knots and seen this ship do things ships don't do. And it is a game changer strategically and tactically for the United States Navy, and I believe that demand for this ship will be superior. So our job here is to focus on execution. Probably think in expanding the definition of execution or re-emphasizing the affordability part of that, because very clearly what we see in the global capital markets is a desire to have sufficient stimulus and fiscal policy to reinvigorate the economy. It also means that there will be pressure on funding, and we're very aware of that. And yet we can't take a step to the side or back on assuring the nation's security and reinforcing the relationships we have with allies. So that means a considered effort on our part to think about affordability to help our customers be strategic buyers and deliver for them value where they rightfully expect that. I think as we watch markets unfold, we want to make sure our missile defense capabilities are right particularly in the terminal phase with a bad program PAC3 and I think we have three excellent programs there. When we look at risks around the world we see those threat proliferating faster. You probably don't have to do more than pick up a newspaper today and read about the proliferation of those threats so we want to get that right. It's sort of a separate category of strategic things to think about. We need talent in this business and I'm hugely pleased with the position that the company has today of being a highly desired place with the best and brightest people who want to come to work. So the confluence now of years and years of careful attention is building a leadership model that all of us aspire to, to assuring that we have a company that is open and inclusive such that when you bring your A game here, you get playing time, and if you do well you can do more, and you can reach personal aspirations and professional aspirations. That is a very contagious part of the culture here and we are really surrounded and actually quite blessed to have colleagues who are very excited, very focused on the mission, understand their connectivity to our customers and want to do a good job. And quite candidly, they understand that doing a good job means returning value to shareholders and they intend to do that as well.
Douglas Harned – Sanford Bernstein: One of the areas that you mentioned at the outset was also cyber security. Can you dimension how large that could be for the company in terms of revenue say within the next three years? What order of magnitude are we looking at?
Robert Stevens: Actually it's very difficult for me to do that and let me tell you why. Already in much of our information technology work, you get an element of cyber security. It might be an intrusion protection capability or a prophylactic that allows a network to remain secure and less easy to penetrate. Or, redundancies such that if there were a denial of service attack that the network could repopulate itself. The system would sail over easily. So we already have I think a significant portfolio of those capabilities. What I think will happen is the tempo and the criticality of assuring that all new systems that go into place have these capabilities and all rated system be brought up to this standard is an absolute imperative. And the reason for that is, networks fail at their most vulnerable linkage and it's all the nodes and all the productivity. It's a very different model and some overall models for security have. Networks behave the way they do, and I think to have any assurance that we're providing sound security solutions in these networks means that you've got to in and invest yourself and build the new networks outright, and I think there will more business. It's very hard for me to have it segregated out of revenue today.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Peter Arnnet – Broadpoint Amtak]
[Peter Arnnet – Broadpoint Amtak]: Congratulations on a nice 2009. The Department of Defense is getting ready for their QDR next month and there's been a lot of calls of rebalancing the DOD's long term budget plan. How should we think about that in affecting Lockheed Martin?
Robert Stevens: We look forward to QDR. We think it's a very healthy examination. It's very difficult for you and frankly for us to get any visibility about what makes sense if you don't follow a strategy, you don't have some sense of in the case of the QDR, what the global threats look like. If there's anything that we've learned it's that the velocity and dynamic range of threats is simply increasing. It used to be months or years, and then it was weeks, and then its days, and now it's even less. And so it's healthy to pause and take an examination of exactly what threats are out there. And then we'll have to collectively determine how technology can play a role in meeting those threats. How much core structure will we need? What will the assumptions be about Iraq, about Afghanistan, about other critical and sensitive places around the world. Do we want to prepare for two theaters, one theater? How broadly, how deeply? Those are the most healthy discussions that I think that we can engage in. And from that, I think will unfold the prioritization across the portfolio. But I say that with some confidence because I do believe we've been as careful as we can be working internal with our company and with the prior administration about understanding threats and securities.  And I think that's not a political dimension. I don't think it's a party affiliation. I think threats tend to have persistence and I think we've got most of the analysis right. And while some of the priorities will change most of investments that we've made, most of the lines of business that we've crafted, all of our acquisitions have led to focusing on what are the most enduring national imperative critical missionaries because that's what fuels our business. That's what gets our folks excited. So I actually think that there will be pretty strong core relations between what we've been doing up to now and what we will have to do next. There will very obviously be specific program discussions like, will there be for F22's? That's a healthy conversation to have. We have our views about that program. Others have their views. We ought to have that discussion in the open. We ought to weight the strength and the weaknesses, make decisions and move forward. I'm very confident we'll be able to do that.
[Peter Arnnet – Broadpoint Amtak]: You mentioned F-35 as retiring a lot of risk, how should we think about that margin progression throughout this year and maybe heading into 2010?
Bruce Tanner: We do see some margin. We are planning for some margin improvement on the F-35 program. We've really got kind of a two pronged approach that's benefiting there. One is we do have some expectations that the FCD program itself will retire enough risk to justify some level of step up there, and those will justify that include obviously the first flight of the STOVL aircraft in the STOVL mode probably later in the first half of this year. Then completion of the aircraft, and also the first flight of the Navy there, the CD as well call it. I think that will allow that. The other prong that's attributing to that margin improvement is just the introduction of greater lower initial production volume which is bringing with it slightly higher margins than the FCD contract.
Operator: Your next question comes from Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: I have a split question between Bob and Bruce. I wanted to ask about international. Can you talk to us about the international sales in 2008 by division? Remind us what percentage of your backlog is in international right now and what you expect sales growth to look like international in 2009?
Bruce Tanner: Let me start of first with the backlog percent of international business. What we have as you might expect given the level of sales, we have slightly higher than 15% of backlog is made up of international contracts. It actually grew at a faster clip in 2008 than did the sales, and we're happy about that.  As far as by business area, I think you well know the biggest two areas where we have international activity is the electronic systems business area which is probably approaching 30% of the volume within electronic systems. And in the aeronautics business which is somewhere in the 22% to 23% range or so there. And then as far as growth going forward, I think you're going to see growth in international business in electronic systems. It's probably going to be at a higher clip than I'll say the mid single digit level that electronic systems is growing at as a business area in total.  And in aeronautics, near term probably some slight reduction just because that 35 will be growing at a much faster clip, obviously a huge step up from the U.S. Government portion of the business. With some of the orders I talked about previously with the F16 and C-130, that will contribute to higher international dollars but much of the percentage will go up simply because it will be kind of overwhelmed by the F-35.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: I can't do the math on the moving parts fast enough, but what does that put international sales content in '08 and where does it go in '09?
Bruce Tanner: I think international sales in '08 were greater than $6 billion. I think it was in the 14%, 15% range and I think at least for 2009, it's probably going to be a similar percentage. So whatever that works out to be on our sales guidance, it's pretty close to that.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: And you're not talking about lift in margins at ES even though now you've secured the UEA tax treaty and it looks like you're going to get that in a quarter or two from now. I know those will be small, but won't those provide some amount of lift over the next two years.
Bruce Tanner: Think of both FAS and PAC 3 as being delivery based contracts, not too different from delivery based contracts that we have in aeronautics, but they're a little shorter duration, but typically think of them as about an 18 month cycle from the award to actually deliver the product. The awards that we were awarded last year will actually not have a sales value in 2009.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: Bob, on international from your perspective when you think about the skyline over the next couple of years, how much of your forecast for sales growth includes Middle East and how does it change in oil price kind of alter your plans with respect to Middle East demand the next couple of years?
Robert Stevens: Actually not very much, and I'll tell you why. It's one of those environments where if you've got oil and the price is low now, you got oil, and you also have a vulnerability, and you will protect that vulnerability. And the need to protect those vulnerabilities really drives the desire for security systems. I'm looking at about five or six areas of where in the near, intermediate, maybe longer term, we're probably going to see lots of interest across our portfolio. First in airplanes. I think the F-35 will continue to have real appeal for international customers because it gives them a leveraged advantage from being connected. There's so much more information technology that that airplane lets you connect to. So you're inter-operable. You're already inter-connected and you're getting a fifth generation superior performance aircraft. I also think the C-130J falls into that category as we've already discussed. Separately, missile defense systems. Those are one of the highest proliferating threats out there. You see it every day and almost anyone who has anything to protect is going to want to invest in some version of PAC 3 FAD Egis, or a command and control systems that allow you to link that with your air traffic management system or other things as we have superior expertise along those lines. A little long out, but not that far out, I think protection of the Littoral and the Littoral combat ship is going to be of huge interest. Think pilots in the Gulf of Aidan, and I guarantee you haven't ridden on this ship, there won't be any more pirates in the Gulf of Aidan because it's a 377 foot cigar boat that will run down anything else on the sea. On land vehicles, we're probably a couple of steps away here, but I really like our concepts for the joint life tactical vehicle, and I think that vehicle has legs not just for the U.S. forces but opens up an international aperture for the company, as does our logistics and supply chain management and services businesses because talent is a constraint strategically not just for the company, but for governments around the world. We can start doing work freeing up levels of talent for our partner governments internationally. That's a very appealing construct and of course we can now provide a much full array of turn-key solutions for logistics, and I think you'll see the same thing in services and technologies. So there are multiple apertures in our company in the intermediate and longer term for us to look for expansion and growth.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley: You touched on opportunities within Linda Gooden's world, but does the focus of the Obama administration on both smart stealth and diplomacy and working with allies portend that maybe in the quest for heightened global security, give more opportunities overseas?
Robert Stevens: I'm sorry I didn't do a better job on that in the remarks that we offered. I highlighted PA&E because I think they fit right in the sweet part on smart power. That was a judgment you know we made in 2006. In this strategic assessment that we did in the changing definition of global security and our changed strategy to be that global security company, we saw very clearly that there was a huge appetite in global demand for the United States to take this prodigious power and influence that we have and express it in ways other than militarily. And I think that absolutely now unfolding in the policy discussion that we're hearing, and I think Linda's business is supremely well positioned to contribute right now to this evolving missionary.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Strauss – UBS.
David Strauss – UBS: The FY10 budget, when do you think we'll see that? When do you expect the 10 process to play out here?
Robert Stevens: Well I know the Obama administration has been in place now a day, maybe two whole days so I think all of us ought to give them enough time. Probably what we will see is somewhere around February 13 might be a day you'd keep in mind. We'll see what actually is quite a traditional view of sending up top line agency numbers. Now, I'll go backwards a little bit and see if we can put flesh on this. The '09 base budget was about $512 billion and the former administration was looking at about a 1% to 2% growth in that to about $524 billion, and then in discussions, that $524 billion actually went up to about $581 billion. I think it's just fair game to ask and permit the incoming administration to look at that and see what they want to do in sculpting that top line. It may not be $581 billion. It may well be something less than that. They will also need to look at the op tempo in Iraq and make some critical judgments about supplementals which I know they will want to do. So I think the preliminary top line sort of organizing principals will go up in February and the probably in the April/May time, we'll start seeing more flesh about priorities, judgments and funding, and I know all that will unfold against the backdrop of this discussion that we're all feeling about what's the appropriate stimulus package. So this sending up the budget in February with the top line is very typical in a transitional environment. What's atypical is the desire to focus on the economic stimulus. I'm certain there will be some discussions about how much of the Fed's budget will in fact have the core and additional benefit of having the stimulus effect. All of that will be good and welcome and we'll keep you posted as we learn more about it as it unfolds in real time.
David Strauss – UBS:  Directionally, the pension as we think about it beyond 2009 into 2010 assuming that the discount rate doesn't really move and you hit your assumed rate of return, is it fair to think about the FAS adjustment in 2010 would actually be higher than 2009?
Bruce Tanner: Let me start by saying that the one thing I'm glad about our FAS/CAS is that for all the variability that we've had getting to this point, at least I know it's locked down in 2009, and for that I'm extremely happy. As we take a look at 2010, as you well know, and I heard your questions, but as you well know the rates can change dramatically between now and the end of the year. FAS returns have yet to be played out. The piece that gives me a little pause to answer your question, I don't know what's going to happen. That kind of affects FAS more so than CAS.  The wild card today that could affect 2010 is the CAS amortization that I mentioned. Those discussions will take place throughout 2009 and they could have a substantial impact whether they close and therefore are affected in the year 2010 or affected in the year 2011. And because of that variability, I'm just hesitant at this time to even guess what that's going to look like in 2010. We're going to provide as soon as we know it updated evaluation of what is happening with the cash amortization process going forward.
Robert Stevens: Let me end by reiterating the corporation has been performing at a very high operational level and we intend to continue to do so. We have a record portfolio of long term work, solid balance sheet, excellent cash flows and sound credit rating. All of these provide a solid foundation that has us well positioned to weather the unprecedented financial turmoil in the marketplace. Our financial strength and market position has provided the stability to remain on the operational and financial course we believe will generate solid returns for our shareholders in this challenging period. I want to end by thanking our 146,000 employees. This world class team has enabled Lockheed Martin to achieve [audio ends].

Operator:  Good day and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Corporation third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher:  Thank you, Teresa, and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call is Bruce Tanner, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President. I would like to remind you that statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website, which supplement our comments today, including details of the financial outlooks by business area for both calendar years 2008 and 2009. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bruce.
Bruce Tanner:  Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. In this period of market turbulence I appreciate your support and interest in Lockheed Martin as we continue to execute on our strong portfolio of programs. I would like to begin by stating that we had a solid third quarter with strong operational and financial contributions from each of our four business areas. Our results reflect excellent performance across the Corporation and are enabling us to continue our momentum as we work to provide value to shareholders and customers. Before I move into specific details of the third quarter accomplishments and performance, I want to offer a brief perspective on how the Corporation is positioned within the financial environment as well an assessment of the recently approved FY09 defense budget. At an operational level we continue to see minimal effects to our activities from the current financial environment. With the vast majority of our revenues being funded by the U.S., we are fortunate to have a relatively insulated market position. Support from our subcontractor and supplier base remains solid and we continue to have access to required raw materials to enable execution of programs. Our liquidity position remains strong with $2.5 billion of available cash on the balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. Our cash and short-term investments provide excellent liquidity for the Corporation and we have also focused on safety and liquidity over yields in our deployment of assets. We remain on track to generate cash consistent with net earnings further demonstrating our long-established excellence in cash generation. In the area of debt we have no commercial paper outstanding or required. Our $3.8 billion in outstanding debt consist entirely of fixed-rate instruments (inaudible) by low capital leverage ratio of 28%. Looking forward, we have less than $250 million in scheduled debt retirements from now through 2012 and we continue to have adequate access to both short- and long-term debt markets. On a non-operational level, the difficult market conditions have resulted in 2008 returns on invested assets underperforming expectations. Reductions in market returns have resulted in recognition of unrealized losses on marketable securities held to fund certain non-qualified employee benefit obligations. Despite these non-operational headwinds, our excellent cash generation, low debt level, and solid financial results have enabled our financial foundation to remain strong in this market environment. We will continue to remain alert, agile, and opportunistic in response to changing financial and market conditions as we navigate through this dynamic period and satisfy our commitments to customers, shareholders, and employees. Moving to the defense budget, the FY09 DoD appropriations bill was recently signed into law by President Bush at $512 billion. This core defense budget reflects growth of approximately 6% above 2008 levels and provides solid support for our products, including funds for extensions and growth on a number of key programs. Our portfolio of programs is expected to grow consistent with the DoD core budget, driven primarily by strong future growth on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program. Specific items approved in the new budget includes funds for the third LRIP contract on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; eight C-130J aircraft; $523 million for lot 10 long-lead procurement activities on the F-22 Raptor; two Littoral Combat Ships; and $735 million for Increment One work on the VH-71 presidential helicopter. This budget reflects the bi-partisan recognition of the need to replace critical aging assets through recapitalization activities. With FY09 appropriations being expended over the next few years, this budget provides a solid foundation and visibility of work in calendar years 2009 and 2010. The new core budget will also add to our existing $76 billion backlog and further position us to grow revenues in 2009 and beyond. Looking at the FY09 supplemental budget, an initial (inaudible) of $62 billion was approved to continue to fund activities in Iraq and Afghanistan on an interim basis. Determination of the final level of the 2009 supplemental budget will be made in the upcoming administration next year after evaluation of in-theatre requirements. Supplemental budgets have declined from their peak in FY08 and are likely to be reduced in the future as resources are redeployed for other spending requirements. We do not see material impacts on our business portfolio from any future reductions to supplemental budgets. Turning to our third quarter results, the Corporation had strong operational performance with segment operating margins of 11.8%, cash generation of over $1 billion, growing backlog by $1.5 billion, continuing our share repurchase activity, and increasing our quarterly dividend by 36% to $0.57 per share. Based on year-to-date performance we are increasing 2008 full-year financial guidance for segment operating profit, earnings per share, and return on invested capital. Details of the new increased guidance are outlined in the webcast charts and in today’s press release. Let me now highlight some of the recent new business awards and operational achievements in each of the business areas starting with Aeronautics segment. Key international and domestic new business awards were won this quarter that enabled expansion of Aeronautics backlog by approximately $900 million. International awards include the receipt of a $394 million contract from Qatar to purchase four C-130J’s plus spares and training support. Qatar becomes the ninth nation to purchase the C-130J aircraft and joins the rapidly growing number of nations utilizing the C-130J’s in their fleets. Operationally, Aeronautics continues to excel in multiple areas. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter achieved the 50th flight of the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft and successfully completed a three-hour cross-country flight to Edwards Air Force Base, landing Code One with no problems. The short takeoff/vertical landing aircraft continued preparation for receipt of the new redesigned engine from the government in January 2009 and the first STOVL flight planned in early 2009. The F-22 Raptor program accomplished two key events this quarter with achievement of over 50,000 flight hours for the fleet and receipt of the prestigious Department of Defense Performance Based Logistics Service System Level Award. This annual award is presented by the Office of the Secretary of Defense to the best PBL contractor. The F-22 program was recognized as exemplary for their achievement of providing higher aircraft readiness rates to war fighters and lower cost to taxpayers. Additionally, the Aeronautics Skunk Works unit received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Bush at a recent White House ceremony. This award conveys the nation’s highest honor to corporations or individuals for their outstanding contributions to United States through their technological innovation and is an affirmation of the thought leadership of the Corporation in designing critical new technologies and solutions for the nation. In Electronic Systems, we continue to win key new business awards and achieve operational milestones for customers. New business wins included the Defense Logistics Agency award of the Fleet Automotive Support Initiative-Global contract. This contract will leverage the Corporation’s expertise in performance based logistics and global supply chain management by providing sustainment work for all of the U.S. military’s land based vehicles over the next 10 years. This sole sourced ID/IQ contract has a potential value of up to $5.6 billion. Electronic Systems was also notified of their selection by Canada for two contracts totaling approximately $2 billion. The first contract, valued at $1.4 billion, will modernize the command and control systems on 12 Halifax Class Navy frigates. The second contract for $600 million will provide long-term in-service support of the ship’s combat systems. These contracts will enhance cooperation with Canada and expand the growing international revenues within the Electronic Systems segment. Key operational accomplishments were also achieved this quarter by Electronic Systems. In our shipbuilding area, the Littoral Combat Ship program successfully conducted acceptance sea trials of our inaugural ship, Freedom, with a demonstration of the ship’s speed, maneuverability, and unique capabilities. This success resulted in the delivery and acceptance of this innovative vessel for the U.S. Navy and provides the first Littoral Combat Ship to the nation. With the FY09 defense budget containing approved funds for two new ships we look forward to placement of new ship orders by the Navy as soon as possible so it can help support their need to construct the 55-ship fleet of this new class of warships. The VH-71 presidential helicopter program achieved a major milestone this quarter with completion of the maiden flight of the first operational pilot production aircraft. This program continues to gain momentum on Increment One activities as we move towards delivery of these much-needed aircraft to the Marine Corps and White House. I will move next to our Information Systems & Global Services segment. IS&GS continue to leverage their portfolio of total systems offerings as shown by their success in securing new business awards. This quarter, IS&GS was awarded a $300 million contract to support the 2011 census for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. This award builds upon their legacy expertise in providing census support to the U.S., Canada, and United Kingdom. Additionally, the U.S. Air Force selected IS&GS to compete for contracts under their Future Flexible Acquisition & Sustainment Tool program. This selection allows IS&GS to compete for development, modification, and maintenance work task orders under a 10-year ID/IQ contract program with a potential value up to $6.9 billion. IS&GS continue their expansion of business with other government agencies with a selection by the Department of Energy to provide a broad range of site services to the DoE Hanford site. The program has a potential value of $3 billion over a 10-year period. Although this program has been placed under protest by a competitor, we look forward to successful protest resolution, so work can proceed. While we did not recognize the Hanford order this quarter due to the open protest, IS&GS still achieved a record backlog level in excess of $12 billion. The record backlog has IS&GS well positioned to achieve their double-digit revenue growth goal. We expect IS&GS to continue to have the highest revenue growth rate of all of our business areas. Finally, the Space Systems segment also continued to win new awards and demonstrate operational excellence. NASA selected Space Systems to design, build, and operate the spacecraft for the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution program. This $485 million project will analyze the upper atmosphere and past climate change on Mars. The maiden mission builds upon the long history of successful inter-planetary expertise of the Space segment and expands upon their position as the world’s largest space company. Operationally, the Trident Fleet Ballistic Missile for the U.S. Navy achieved its 124th consecutive test launch, extending a record of success back to 1989. These operational accomplishments and important new business wins across all of our business segments have us well positioned for future financial growth. Before turning to your questions, I would like to provide a little color on our 2008 and 2009 guidance. As you’ve seen in our press release, the revised 2008 guidance reflects increases in our segment operating profit, earnings per share, and return on invested capital. These increases were partially offset by the recognition of unrealized losses on marketable securities held to fund certain non-qualified employee benefit obligations. Consistent with our expectations and goals, the 2009 guidance projects top line revenues returning to a more robust growth rate of approximately 6%, the range midpoints. Our guidance also projects achievement of our previously stated goal to accelerate the generation of $5 billion in segment operating profit end of 2009, achieving a one-year acceleration from our prior goal date of 2010. Cash from operations in 2009 is projected to be at least $4 billion and reflects continued strong cash generation. Finally, we expect to remain an industry leader in 2009 with return on invested capital projected to be greater than 20%. Regarding assumptions for our FAS/CAS adjustments to earnings, our 2009 outlook is based on a projected discount rate of 7.5% and 2008 return on pension assets of negative 25%. Recent volatility in the financial markets has intensified the challenge of trying to accurately estimate the discount rate we will use at the end of 2008 or the return on our benefit plan assets. We have included a schedule in today’s web charts that provide sensitivity ranges of various changes and concern [ph] on plan assets for your reference. The data table represents the results of these various assumptions on the 2009 projected FAS/CAS pension adjustments and associated cash contributions. Consistent with our historical practice, we will establish final assumptions on the discount rate and our final actual 2008 asset return value after the close of the year, and provide any updated guidance in our January earnings call. In summary, our financial performance, operational accomplishments, and new business wins across all of our business segments this quarter have us well positioned for increased financial growth in 2009 and beyond. Our diversified portfolio and solid financial foundation will serve us well as we move forward in creating value for customers and shareholders. I would now like to open up the line for your question. Teresa, would you please open the line?
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator instructions) We will go to Troy Lahr, Stifel Nicolaus.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus:  Thanks. Just wondered if you can highlight some of the moving pieces in ’09 for the Space Systems segment with the flat sales that you are calling for and how that’s impacted by TSAT?
Bruce Tanner:  Sure. Thanks Troy. Yes, taking a look at Space, you said Space sales are fairly flat going from ’08 to ’09 that’s probably a pretty accurate depiction. I think there is a couple of things going on there. One, we have one less commercial satellite. In 2009 we have none – in 2009 whereas we did have one in 2008. Second, we have one commercial launch in 2008, we have zero commercial launches in 2009. That’s partially offset by higher activity in our government satellites business, a lot of that coming from our increased effort in the GPS III effort as well as our AEHF activities. You asked about TSAT. TSAT – I’ve read the press release but there (inaudible) on the press – on that contract, but there has been no official word at least that we have received yet from the U.S. government relative to TSAT’s continuing forward or not. We do have TSAT kind of on a pro-rated basis or a de-rated [ph] basis in our outlook. It will create probably some pressure on our overall sales level in Space. In fact that activity or that contract was not awarded [ph].
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus:  But if TSAT goes away, does that mean you could benefit from a more Advanced EHF then do you think?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, the expectation let’s talk about what TSAT is. I mean TSAT is kind of the follow-on to secure communications. And we kind of started this business with the Milstar contract years ago. AEH is kind of the current version of that. And then TSAT was sort of the next laser-based secure communications systems. So we are the incumbent with the AEHF satellites I mean the expectation I have I think would be that we will continue to sell those and perhaps spiral those (inaudible) TSAT and not materialize.
Troy Lahr – Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay, thanks.
Bruce Tanner:  Thank you, Troy.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse:  Good morning, Bruce, Jerry.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, good morning. 
Jerry Kircher:  Good morning.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse:  Let’s talk about Aeronautics for a minute. If you could walk us through the moving pieces in Aeronautics, and in the fourth quarter it looks like you’ve got fewer F-22’s and F-16’s, if you could talk about that a little bit. And then maybe move in to F-35 outlook for the next couple of years in terms of timing on the LRIP’s from a revenue and margin perspective.
Bruce Tanner: 
 : And I think you asked about the F-35 revenue growth and margin. Interesting thing is going on with F-35. We literally are expecting to see – well, let me break it into pieces, the SPD contract kind of the development contract on the F-35 program has hit its peak and we are actually seeing that start to wind down now. So from ’08 to ’09 we actually see about $1 billion of reduced development effort on that contract. Conversely, we are seeing the ramp up on the early LRIP contracts, the Low-Rate Initial Production contracts. So, we expect to see close to $2 billion of growth from 2008 to 2009 on the LRIP contracts. Between the two of those events we are expecting to see F-35 grow at about 25% cliff year-over-year from 2009 to 2008, comparing those two years. We do expect to have some slight margin improvement in 2009 on the F-35 contract as we do expect to have some risk retirements that allow us to take the booking rate on that particular – the developmental contract up and we are also seeing the activity of the production contracts, which are starting to be booked at about a level comparable to what we are seeing on the development contract. And— go ahead, I am sorry.

And— go ahead, I am sorry.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse:  Well, I was going to ask you just give us a little trajectory on F-35 revenue growth into ’10 [ph] based on what you talked about, the 25% type of number, and in ’09 based on what the current schedules are.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, I don’t have the number off the top of my head, Rob, to be honest with you, but we expect to see very similar levels of growth going from ’09 into ’10 at the current rates. We are still on track. I think we’ve talked about, within Aeronautics having, Aeronautics get to about $20 billion a year business area by 2015. F-35 is probably $15 billion-$16 billion of that – that timeframe. So we will be honest, I would like to have to reach those between 2010 and 2015.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse:  Okay. And then just my follow-up question is on share buyback cash deployment. Well, your guidance for ’09 contemplates what kind of share count and can we assume that that – well, why don’t I ask you that question first – and then does that contemplate share repurchase?
Bruce Tanner:  We expect to continue our standard practice at least as we outlook 50% of return of free cash flow in the form of dividends or share repurchases. If you just walk that through with our assumption for 2009, that would result in about 403 million shares outstanding is we are kind of considering. We will give you the guidance for next year.
Robert Spingarn – Credit Suisse:  Okay, thanks very much.
Bruce Tanner:  Thank you.
Operator:  And we will go next to David Strauss, UBS.
David Strauss – UBS:  Good morning.
Bruce Tanner:  Good morning.
David Strauss – UBS:  Bruce, can you give the breakout in terms of your assumptions for FAS and CAS, what exactly you are assuming for FAS and CAS and then also if you kind of assume in 2009 that you hit your assumed rate of return and the discount rate doesn’t change in ’09, given the smoothing mechanism that you used, would you anticipate that pension expense in 2010 would be higher again than 2009?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, let me give you the piece as I think – and I hope the – by the way, I hope the table that we provided in both the web charts and in our discussions that we have had, I hope those were helpful as far as helping to understand the – there is a lot of volatility more so than years past especially just in the last 45 days with returns on the assets in our pension plan as everyone else has experienced during this (inaudible) time. I think the pieces – I walk through the pieces first – our cash expense in 2008 is about $590 million. Debt stays fairly flat as we look into 2009. The FAS expense, as we sit here today, in 2008 is about $460 million plus. And we expect that to grow to somewhere in the $640 million-$650 million range in 2009. And again I am a little hesitant, David, to talk about what happens in 2010 only because we haven’t settled 2008 yet. But at the current levels you would expect to see some increased expenditures in 2008 (inaudible) where we are today as we sit here in the middle of October.
David Strauss – UBS:  Okay, fair enough. Looking at Electronic Systems, could you talk about I guess in the quarter Missiles and Fire Control sales were up but profit was down. What was going on there, and as well kind of the outlook by business within ES for 2009.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, you read that right. Missile and Fire Control sales are up – revenue or excuse me profit was little bit down, not for any sort of operational reasons whatsoever. We just had some higher growth on some lower-margins programs. I think to name two I mean we got the (inaudible) program some of the Sniper activity that was higher in the third quarter of ’08 compared to third quarter of ’07. Those are a little lower than the outstanding returns, the Missile and Fire Control typically generates. But again, nothing operational, it’s just kind of the mix of business going forward. And then you asked about – I am sorry, going into next year—
David Strauss – UBS:  Yes, the outlook by business within ES.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, within ES, we see continued growth really driven – the biggest growth (inaudible) the overall growth of Electronics, we still expect to be probably in the mid-single digits, have a steady 85% [ph] like we always get, it’s driven predominantly growth wise next year by our PT&E line of business, the Platform, Training & Energy piece of the business, and a large part of that is we expect to have because of the funding I mentioned in the prepared comments, we did expect to have higher sales values on the VH-71 program, the Increment One piece. And we are also seeing higher growth on our other rotary platforms including the MH-60 (inaudible). So, PT&E growth a little faster than the overall Electronic Systems average. MS2, Maritime Systems & Sensors, and Missiles and Fire Control grow a little bit slightly behind the average growth rate of Electronic Systems, but both fairly consistent to each other.
David Strauss – UBS:  Great, thanks Bruce.
Bruce Tanner:  You bet.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr, Cowen & Co..
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.:  Thank you very much. So, it looks like your advance is quite up in the third quarter. Can you give us any update, any more optimism that that continue up given your foreign [ph] sales prospects.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, we – actually, Cai, we see probably a little bit of deterioration in these (inaudible) towards the end of this year. And as we look into next year, it’s always hard to predict when the international customers will actually get tied under contract and what exactly we can arrange from a terms and conditions that would allow those sorts of advance payments. But I would think our activity going into 2009 will be fairly consistent with what we saw in 2008.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.:  Okay, okay. And it looks like your DSOs went up a little bit. Is that anything – what’s the reason for that and is that expected to reverse as you go into the fourth quarter?
Bruce Tanner:  No, we actually expect – I mean I think teed up in the second quarter, we thought the working capital was going to grow some towards the end of the year. That’s what we are seeing. I expect we’ll see in 2009 some further working capital growth about consistent with what we saw in 2008. So, not a great surprise there.
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.:  Okay. And then, the last one, any change in your thoughts on capital deployment given kind of the credit situation like you kind of have in your profile what you might do in terms of the pension plan, any thoughts on maybe kind of putting more money than that in and what would the tax implications of that be?
Bruce Tanner:  More money in the pension plan, Cai?
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.:  Yes.
Bruce Tanner:  I think the bottom line view point that we have as far as cash and cash deployment is wherever we have opportunities and if we see opportunities to either make acquisitions or if we think there is a better benefit to deploying that cash early into the pension plan, we will make that call, but at this point in time I don’t necessarily have a strong inkling for one or the other. It’s going to be very opportunistic as we go forward. I think our cash deployment practice have been fairly transparent in the past and we will make sure they are going forward. 
Cai von Rumohr – Cowen & Co.:  Thank you.
Bruce Tanner:  Thank you.
Operator:  (Operator instructions) We will go next to Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.
Joe Nadol – JPMorgan:  Thanks, good morning.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Joe.
Joe Nadol – JPMorgan:  Just a couple of questions, well, one two-part question on the sales outlook for next year. In Aeronautics why is the rest of the business shrinking ex-F-35, particularly when C-130 should be ramping up? And secondly, it looks like the organic growth rate in IS&GS is in the single digits. We had expected that to be more like in the low-double digits. Is there a change in expectation there?
Bruce Tanner: 
 : You mentioned C-130, C-130’s we actually are seeing some growth. We are expecting 16 C-130 aircraft in 2009 compared to 12 in 2008, so you will see some growth there. And then lastly I guess it may be a little bit of down activity in some of the other Aeronautics, R&D those sorts of activities, but fairly minor from that point. Next you talked about IS&GS and the organic growth rate. We have given at this point, guiding – I think we have given the range guidance at the top line of 9% to 11%. I think that’s very consistent with what we have talked about in terms of – I am sorry, it’s about 8% to 11%. I think that’s very consistent with the – with our expectation of double digit growth. I think there is still a great opportunity to achieve that. If we take a look at what we have been able to do with IS&GS over this year as we look forward next year, we are currently generating a $1 billion of organic growth year-over-year. So that’s something we take great pride in and I think the percentages were worked out. As we continue to win new business in the latter part of this year, we got a great stream and a great record this year of wins in IS&GS and if we can continue that going forward I think that will position us very well for 2009 as well.
Joe Nadol – JPMorgan:  Okay, thanks for that, Bruce. And then just as a follow-up, looking at the fourth quarter of ’08, it seems like – is it fair to say that you must be looking for the upper end of the range for operating profit specifically. You can take kind of the middle and you look at what you have done so far this year, you have done more than three quarters of it, and typically your fourth quarter is obviously a higher quarter than the other three. So, is it fair to say upper end of the range there?
Bruce Tanner:  I will try to – (inaudible) answering that question, I will try to give you some pretty specific guidance. I think we tried to do that in the second quarter as far what we expected to see in the third quarter. As we look at fourth quarter I think fourth quarter is going to be slightly higher than third, but maybe not quite as high as fourth quarter of 2008. Again, I think we are going to see some downturn in the Aeronautics business. It kind of mitigates some of that a little bit relative to what maybe you might be expecting there. So, numbers in the 10-7, 10-8 range would be – about what I am expecting there. Margin wise, I think operating margin, we are seeing strong performance and I – we expect to still see strong performance in the fourth quarter for all four business areas. I think Space will be down somewhat because of the mix of ULA. The equity earnings that we receive from ULA in the fourth quarter will be probably a little less than what we have seen for the first three quarters simply because of the mix of activity in that quarter. And then the last thing that’s going to put some pressure on our overall margin (inaudible) time, is we had teed up I think if you look at the web charts and some of our press release information, we have teed the fact that we have some non-qualified employee benefits that are kind of mark-to-market. These are consolidated activities that do flow through the P&L account. And we had about $30 million item in the third quarter. We are actually expecting about $80 million as we sit here today. These funds are invested similarly to how we invest our pension returns. And if you kind of put the same extrapolations on those funds in the fourth quarter, it says we have got about $80 million headwind on those assets in the fourth quarter. That’s also included in our guidance for the rest of this year, Joe.
Joe Nadol – JPMorgan:  Okay. Thanks, Bruce.
Bruce Tanner:  Thank you.
Operator:  And we’ll go next to Robert Stallard, Macquarie.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie:  Good morning.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Rob.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie:  Bruce, first of all, on LCS, you mentioned that there have been a couple of boats put into the FY09 budget. Have you had any clarity under what contractual terms the DoD is expected to award those contracts?
Bruce Tanner:  We have had discussions – I think that’s still an open item, Rob, to be honest with you.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie:  Because in the past you said you wouldn’t accept fixed price development. Is that something the Navy is still looking at?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, I don’t think – I think that’s still with their position, Rob, we would not like that fixed-price development. I think maybe a better question is would there be development on the next LCS or not. And that’s kind of the point that we are having discussions with the Navy on.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie:  Okay. And as a follow-up, on the pension, I was wondering if you could clarify what is in the pension at the moment in terms of the weightings of equities debt.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, we have got – I guess what you might expect most portfolios of this size to have in terms of weightings, we have got both U.S. equity and international equities, so that’s probably in the – 55%-60% range or so. We are probably between bonds and some other alternative investments, cash, some –actually some commodity type of things. Bonds is probably in the 30%, 35%, 40% range and the difference is in the alternative investments. So, fairly, I would think, standard for most – those portfolios with pensions.
Robert Stallard – Macquarie:  Has there been any exceptional losses in the pension fund this year?
Bruce Tanner:  No
Robert Stallard – Macquarie:  Okay, thank you.
Bruce Tanner:  Thank you.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Heidi Wood, Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Good morning.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Heidi.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  I wanted to touch on Space in a little more detail, Bruce. Can you talk about the profitability in Space this quarter, break out a little bit of – you had said the drivers were ULA, higher Orion volumes, and then negotiation on a commercial contract – on change in the contract terms. Can you talk to us about how those led to the 12.8% margins?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, you are looking at third quarter, Heidi?
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Yes.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, we had strong ULA earnings in the quarter and again that’s kind of a mix of the launch vehicles that occurs in ULA as well as some just good performance that occurred in the third quarter on ULA and we got our share of that in the quarter. On top of that we had good performance in our government satellite business. We actually had some performance improvements there as well. And we didn’t – (inaudible) we didn’t have the – any of the terminated launch – (inaudible) to be honest with you that was not a third quarter event. There was a commercial item, the termination of a commercial launch that occurred in the first quarter. That might be where some of the confusion is. There was nothing in the third quarter.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Oh I am sorry, okay. What – I am reading the results of the successful negotiation of a terminated contract long-service, oh that’s the first quarter–?
Bruce Tanner:  That was the first quarter, exactly.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Alright. But then what I am trying to get a better handle on is puts and takes as to the sustainability of this 12.8% margins as we go forward into 2009?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  You talked before about revenues earlier, but I would like to get more clarity about the profitability for next year.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes. I think the guidance we are providing for 2008 that’s probably fairly close to – I don’t – let’s back up – I am not sure the 12.8% is sustainable. I think third quarter was high for that – for the reasons I have given you relative to ULA and some profit step-ups we did on our government satellite business. As we look into 2009, I think it’s going to be comparable to what we see in 2008. Maybe the one wild cared there is that 2008 did have the terminated satellite event that you talked about in the first quarter, which actually might be (inaudible) in 2008 that we do not see in 2009.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Okay. And secondly, can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on M&A? There hasn’t been a lot activity for you guys. It’s been fairly selective and niche, but now that we have got on the equity side so many properties beaten up, one would imagine that on the private side we are probably seeing something like that as well. Do you see yourself getting more active strategically in 2009?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes. No, Heidi, I think we just – we have done four acquisitions so far this year. we did several small in the third quarter. A couple of items we did acquisition of (inaudible) and Nantero. A couple of acquisitions that might not have gotten a lot of press. We also bought out the other half of our RLM stake in the Australian business down there. I did see the portfolio as we are looking at it – it’s a very good pipeline of opportunities going forward. We are very selective in the process we use. I think we got a – hopefully a recognized that this is one approach for how we approach this. I do think the valuations had been helped here recently by the recent events. So I am optimistic that that will create some better opportunities than we have seen here in the last year or so.
Heidi Wood – Morgan Stanley:  Great. Thanks very much.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, thank you.
Operator:  We’ll go next to Richard Safran, Goldman Sachs.
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs:  Hi, good morning.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Rich, how are you?
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs:  Very good, thanks. This year we have seen a number of competitions really sliding to the right, delayed for one reason or another. So, just from what you are seeing, is this any indication of the government having difficulty funding or is it that you think there is some other factor at work?
Bruce Tanner:  I don’t know if the government is having funding – having any difficulty funding per se. I think it’s probably other matters at work including the change of administration and not wanting to put something new on the plate the day the new secretary walks into the job. I think it’s a bit of a mixed bag as we look at the current environment. I mean there is a number that we are interested in. It’s some kind of start activities. I think we see, for instance, a JLTV, we believe that one actually will take place this year. we are pretty confident that that will take place. Conversely, the CSAR activity seems to be pushing forward to the right. And again, I mentioned earlier that TSAT seems to be in a bit of state of flux as we speak here, but I think overall new starts are going to be difficult in today’s environment particularly the closer we get to a change in administration. But I don’t see it necessarily because of funding situations that you described.
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs:  Okay. And next thing. One issue that had been giving indications of is that small aerospace and defense (inaudible) have been having some trouble obtaining financing just what they need to run their business on a day-to-day basis.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes.
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs:  This is just obviously as a result of current market conditions and I just wanted to know if there is an issue here where Lockheed and even some other large cap defense firms that can be required to use cash to help the supplier base.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes. That’s a good question, Rich. We’ve been monitoring this for at least the last – I don’t know – three, four months, pretty heavily. And we are going to continue to monitor that very, very closely. Frankly, we have not seen impacts to our supply base of the type and nature that you described there. We have actually been very pleased with the lack of finding those situations in our supply base. We are going to continue to watch that very closely, and as far as the latter part of your question, as far as would we use cash, that’s – since I don’t have that situation right now, it’s kind of pure speculation that I am not sure I want to get into it at this point because we don’t have that situation.
Richard Safran – Goldman Sachs:  Thanks a lot.
Bruce Tanner:  Thank you.
Operator:  We’ll go next to Joe Campbell, Barclays Capital.
Carter Copeland – Barclays Capital:  Actually, it’s Carter Copeland. Good morning, guys.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Carter.
Jerry Kircher:  Good morning, Carter.
Carter Copeland – Barclays Capital:  Just a few points – questions for clarification. On Aeronautics, I don’t mean to beat a dead horse here, but it’s – if we just walk through the moving pieces, it sounded like F-16 is roughly offset by F-117 sustainment losses. I think you said a billion of growth on F-35. Seems like C-130 should be another couple of hundred million dollars yet the guidance implies $750 million of growth. So I am just wondering what that gap is. I know you said there is some other aerospace R&D going down but presumably sustainment should be up on programs like F-22. So, I am just trying to – wondered if you can help bridge the gap here a bit. It seems like a pretty big one.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, I don’t know if it’s all that big a gap. I think one of the things that might be missing there is we are still seeing – we are seeing actually a little bit of reduction in F-22 cost volume. I think most of that’s for all the right reasons as we have experienced performance improvements on that front. So that’s some of the reduction. And then kind of the rest of the Aeronautics business, the non-plat – I shouldn’t say non-platform but the non-major four programs, if you will, F-16, F-22, F-35, C-130’s. That part of the business is down a little bit year-over-year as well. Some of that, for instance, I mean to just to name one firm that’s in that mix of the fray is the U-2 program, for instance.
Carter Copeland – Barclays Capital:  Okay.
Bruce Tanner:  We don’t talk about a lot of those kind of smaller pieces, but that’s what is driving some of that next year.
Carter Copeland – Barclays Capital:  Okay. And then another one here for clarification on David’s question, Missiles and Fire Control, I read the release to take it that the actual amount of profit was down yet the comment that you had higher growth in lower margin programs seems to suggest that the margin was down. Was there in fact something that declined here to give us less profit, not less margin.
Bruce Tanner:  I am looking at it – actually profit is down in part because we had such a tremendous level of profit in – third quarter2007, very, very high margin. As I look at the margin in the third quarter of ’08, it’s still in line with the overall Electronic Systems profit rate. So I don’t – again, I don’t think there is any issue there. And there was a mix issue between the programs that happened in the third quarter 2007 versus third quarter 2008.
Carter Copeland – Barclays Capital:  They are just comps.
Bruce Tanner:  It was just comps (inaudible) Missiles and Fire Control is still having a tremendous year. No performance issues there to describe whatsoever.
Carter Copeland – Barclays Capital:  Okay. And the last one on pension. The table you provided is very helpful but I wondered if you had done any sensitivity analysis around the discount rate. If we didn’t in fact keep spread wide for the back portion of this year and in fact the discount rate was not 7.5% but 7%, how that might change your table, any insights there would be really helpful.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, we have looked at and honestly we thought about adding some of those in the table. We thought it might just get too much too quickly. There is less sensitivity in the discount rate, obviously. I think every 25 basis points on the discount rate it’s probably worth like $20 million or $30 million bucks, something along those lines. So, nowhere near what the asset value change at work.
Carter Copeland – Barclays Capital:  Okay. Thank you.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein, Merrill Lynch.
Ronald Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  Hey, good morning guys.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Ron.
Jerry Kircher:  Good morning.
Ronald Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  Bruce, were you the guys the beneficiary of the 2006 Pension Reform Act? And if you were, when did that roll off, I mean when do you have to start taking some action that possibly got delayed because of the–?
Bruce Tanner:  I think defense contractors in general were treated a little differently in the PPA in that we have more time to get the full funding than does most of the rest of industry. Ours is – I believe I now have a number that’s on my head – it’s 2010 or 2011, and in large part that’s because we have – one of the reasons we have the FAS/CAS adjustment is because there is this difference of methodology between the way we recognize expenses on our cost accounting standards versus the way we recognize expenses under the financial accounting standards. And that’s what’s called harmonization between the CAS and FAS that’s yet to take place and that’s what the industry is waiting on before we can make that decision.
Ronald Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  So, you would have to be – I think it’s funded by 2011, that’s what you are taking right?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, we actually you hit the requirement just fit full funding but you actually have a period of time and I believe the period of time is like seven or eight years to reach full funding post that date.
Ronald Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  Okay.
Bruce Tanner:  So, it’s not as if you have to have full funding as of that date, if that makes sense to you.
Ronald Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  Yes, that makes sense. And then just one quick follow-on and I think maybe this is related to Richard’s question. If you look at the cancellation of ARH and the push out of TSAT if that what eventually happens, I mean what that means of the C-5 re-engining, the VH-1. I mean why do you ever think that the DoD seem to be being a little more scrutinize over programs lately.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, I can't talk to the ARH I mean I can only see what I got – read over on the ARH, so I really don’t want to comment on that. TSAT is clearly a question of whether or not the customer needs that sort of additional capability or whether or not they can spiral sort of current activity to provide that sort of as a gap-bridger, if you will. I think on our C-5 program, I feel good about that because we have just gotten out of development for that contract. We have three fliers as we sit here today. They were part of that developmental program. The program actually went perfectly. I mean our flight test program finished early. It demonstrated the kinds of savings in terms of fuel cost, in terms of reliability that we had predicted on the program. And I still think there is a need for those aircrafts, those strategic airlift aircrafts going forward. So I feel pretty good about that program. I think the fact that we got that recently awarded is a good indication of that. You asked about the VH-71, kind of a similar situation I mean again as we sit here today, we are meeting every single key performance parameter on those Increment One aircraft. So, think about it in terms of weight, range, payload, those sorts of things. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have our first pilot production vehicle flying, so that program is doing well. I mean the ones – the program that I will be concerned are those that are new start programs, or those that are not performing well. And I don’t think either one of the programs you mentioned there C-5 or VH-71 are in either one of those categories.
Ronald Epstein – Merrill Lynch:  Great. Thanks a lot.
Bruce Tanner:  Thanks. Operator And we’ll go to Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein:  Good morning.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Doug.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein:  IS&GS, your – as you said, you are right on the edge of double digit revenue growth going into ’09 with you guidance. Could you talk about first have you seen a change in your outlook for IT expenditures from the federal government. And then second, if you look at the three different units there, Information Systems, Global Services, and Mission Solutions, how do you see those sort of relative to each other in terms of growth next year?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes. Good question and let me just reiterate, I don’t see a slowdown in IS&GS growth rate. I mean I appreciate what we are saying about the range that we provided in the guidance there, but our expectation is still – if I had Linda Gooden here I am sure she would echo the fact that she wants to achieve double digit growth year-over-year in her business area. Now having said that, if I look at the three pieces, and I would mention [ph] again, the three pieces that make up IS&GS is the Information Systems pieces, there is the Global Services piece, and there is the Mission Solutions piece. As we look at – those pieces are not growing consistently from ’08 into ’09. The faster growing piece is our Global Services piece. And that’ growing at a rate faster than double digit. The other two lines of business, if you will, the Information Systems and Mission Solutions, are growing slightly less than 10%, but they are growing consistent with each other. So, strong, higher single digit growth rates in both of those and strong double digit growth rates in the Global services piece of it. So, again, I don’t see any particular cause for concern there from my perspective.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein:  And the elsewhere, when you look at foreign military sales, how are you looking at – I mean given the global economic environment, how are you looking at some of the upcoming awards you are hoping for thinks like UAS missile defense and then how firm do you feel that some of the ones you already have say some of the C-130 contracts are, given the outlook right now?
Bruce Tanner:  Okay. I will answer your second question first. I don’t see any of the international sales particularly the C-130 sales we have done here recently impacted by any of the current or most recent financial event. I think those are pretty solid as I sit here and look at today. You asked about the others, missile defense awards and so forth. I think our expectation is that those will track very nicely through our plan. And I don’t see those coming out either from the sequence or the schedule that we have laid on the table for when we expect those to happen. So I guess the short answer to both of those is we don’t see a huge push to the right on the international front as I just mentioned there.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein:  So, no real change when you are talking with your foreign customers?
Bruce Tanner:  None, none whatsoever.
Doug Harned – Sanford Bernstein:  Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator:  And we’ll go to Howard Rubel, Jefferies & Co..
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.:  Well, thank you very much. A follow-up on two things, one of Aeronautics, The P-3 mod, you had an issue with the P-3 mod contract.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.:  Could you tell us how you have beat it to death so that there won't be more of this. The guys in Marietta [ph] were pretty bullish n the opportunities when we were down there not long ago.
Bruce Tanner:  Yes. Well maybe I will split, Howard, if I could, I will split it into two pieces. There is – this is a contract that we have had since 2005. This is really to do sort of heavy maintenance on the existing fleet of P-3 aircraft out in the field and those aircraft have experienced some pretty tough conditions, tough environments to operate in. They have been doing a lot of mission work over in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they were already subjected to kind of the sea, air phenomenon associated with salt there. So – again, we have had this contract since 2005. The contract runs out through 2010, it was a five-year contract. What we are seeing is as these aircrafts get what’s called inducted into the program they are in worse [ph] shape than we had expected and it was just taking us more time to modify and overhaul these aircraft than we expected. This provision that you talk about, that we took in the third quarter we believe takes us out through the full 2010, through the end of the contract, through the 2010 timeframe. So I think we are okay there. I will separate that from – I think what you saw down in Marietta [ph] on the investor tour, which is really the re-wing business and it’s a little bit of a separate business there. We are trying to re-wing aircraft, not do the sustainment or the modification of aircraft that are in the fleet and the overhaul of that. This is re-winging, putting, stripping out the old one, putting the brand new ones on if you will. That activity is still going very well for us. We are still seeing lots of interest, both domestically and internationally from both U.S. Navy as well as custom and border patrol aircraft. Norway, Canada, and some others as well they are having interest in there. So, I will make a distinction those two and say I think we have got the P-3 overhaul effort contained within the write-off [ph] we took in the third quarter and rest of the business is not part of that, if you will.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.:  And Bruce, wouldn’t you have a claim if the customer offered you an airplane that was different from the condition that you had agreed to at the time you had received it?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes. I will say, Howard, we have been having ongoing discussions with our customer about that very matter. And the provision we put in place right now assumes basically the same sort of contractual arrangement as we have today going forward, nothing better. We are in constant I guess discussions as we are literally today with the customer over the very subject that you raised in you question.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.:  And then 3.7 million shares I think is what you purchased in the quarter. That seems relatively low versus the run rate. Was there any event that prevented you from buying more in the period?
Bruce Tanner:  No, I mean nothing. Nothing extraordinary. I think if you look at the pattern we have done in the last couple of years, that’s tended to sort of be our pattern going forward. I don’t think it is anything kind of conscious. We – through the year-to-date third quarter we have had the highest ever share repurchase activity. I mean through the three quarter we have done more than we have in any single year previous to this. I think we have 98% of free cash flow to shareholders. So, I am not apologetic about that. I think we are doing fine there.
Howard Rubel – Jefferies & Co.:  I hear you loud and clear. Thank you.
Bruce Tanner:  Thank you, Howard. Operator And we will go to Myles Walton, Oppenheimer and Company.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.:  Thanks, good morning.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Myles.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.:  Could I ask you about Space for a second particularly in the launch services with respect to equity accounting and USA used to I think account for about $60 million of equity earnings through the P&L. Is that about where it still is and also as the shuttle winds down how quickly does that tail off?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, I think your recollection is pretty accurate, Myles, and let’s go to the wind down. If Space kind of at the current level then at least through 2010, and then the question is will there be a shuttle extension or not and that’s the what if for beyond 2010, but think of it being similar levels to what you described through the 2010 timeframe.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.:  Okay. And then likewise what is – is ULA two times that amount?
Bruce Tanner: 
 :
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.:  Okay. Last one, a clarification on the 25% assumption for the pension plan. Is that where it is currently? Is that just a placeholder? Is that – can you just give us maybe where it is currently?
Bruce Tanner:  Yes, that’s pretty close to where we are literally as I sit here and talk to you today. So, it’s not and if I was to pick a number that would be as good a number as I can pick to you today.
Myles Walton – Oppenheimer & Co.:  Okay thanks.
Bruce Tanner:  I should make one comment. I think I mis-spoke earlier to one of the questions about the commercial satellites and whereas I was talking to Space volume, I think I said there were no commercial sats in 2009 and there was one in 2008. The right answer there is we actually did have two commercial sats in 2008 and we are expecting to have one commercial sat in 2009. My apologies to the mis-speak there.
Jerry Kircher:  Teresa, this is Jerry. I think we have got time for one last one.
Operator:  Thank you. We will go to Harry Nourse, Banc of America.
Harry Nourse – Banc of America:  Good morning.
Bruce Tanner:  Hi, Harry.
Harry Nourse – Banc of America:  You mentioned the LCS addition in 2009. Were there any other moving parts that went in or out of the appropriations bill?
Bruce Tanner:  No, I think we were – we did, we were happy to see – beyond what I talked about in terms of additional advance procurement money for the F-22 program, for instance, we did have the eight C-130s. I think you will see additional C-130s in the ’09 budget at higher levels than we saw in ’08. We saw the VH-71 Increment. We saw the LRIP 3 advanced funding for the F-35 program. So I think for most of the program that you watch closely I think they are well supported in the current budget outlook.
Harry Nourse – Banc of America:  Yes. Apologies if I said that earlier. I was late in joining.
Bruce Tanner:  Okay.
Harry Nourse – Banc of America:  And that’s all actually.
Bruce Tanner:  Okay. Well, thank you, Harry. Well, looking forward, we continue to focus our efforts on cost efficiency and performance on programs. Delivery of the best value to customers in the future budget environment will demand increasingly improved levels of performance. And our 140,000 employees have us uniquely positioned to deliver on this requirement and differentiate Lockheed Martin in the eyes of shareholders and customers. I would like to thank – I would like to close by thanking you for your questions and for joining the call today. We look forward to talking to you again in January when Bob Stevens will be joining us on the call. Bob will review our 2008 results and provide an update of our strategy, and 2009 financial outlook. Teresa, that concludes our call.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Lockheed Martin Corporation Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. During the question-and-answer session, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so that everyone will have the opportunity to ask a question. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher. Mr. Kircher, please go ahead sir.
Jerry F. Kircher, III - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you Rufus and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call is Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law, actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website, which supplement our comments today. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Jerry. Good morning everyone and welcome to the call. Consistent with our expectations, we had a strong second quarter. Our results reflect the operational, strategic, and financial progress we are making across the corporation. This progress is enabling us to build upon our continuing momentum in delivering value to shareholders and customers. As our press release outlined, second quarter results across the corporation were strong, highlighted by an 18% increase in reported earnings per share. We also achieved a 50 basis point increase in segment operating margins that help generate our earnings growth. This margin expansion is a result of improved performance and successful risk reduction activities across multiple programs. Electronic Systems continue to generate operating margin in excess of 13% and our other three business segments all expanded margins this quarter. In the area of cash flows, we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $2.4 billion. Our cash performance as is well positioned to achieve full-year cash flow and generate free cash in excess of the earnings for the 11th consecutive year. This long-term performance is a direct demonstration of our strong focus on management of working capital and cash optimization. With this established expense in cash generation, we remain focused on optimal utilization of our cash to enhance shareholder value. As a part of that focus, we are continuing to implement our long stated practice of making opportunistic share purchases. During the second quarter, we repurchased over 7.3 million shares of our stock for $770 million. This activity brings our year-to-date share repurchases to 18.6 million shares for $2 billion. Our repurchase actions had enabled us to continued to reduce our weighted average diluted share count to approximately 410 million shares for the second quarter, the lowest quarterly average diluted share count level since the third quarter of 2000. In addition to share repurchases, we also paid a second quarter dividend to shareholders of $168 million. With our year-to-date dividend payments and share repurchases, we have already exceeded our commitment to return at least half of our annual free cash flow to shareholders for the sixth constitutive year. Based on our solid first half performance, we are increasing our 2008 full-year financial guidance, reflecting an improved outlook for additional growth in sales, earnings, cash flow and return on invested capital. Today's press release and our supporting webcast charts outline the details of our new increased guidance. These strong financial results and improved guidance are direct reflections of our focus on program execution. Delivery of critical products and services to our customers consistent with their needs and expectations is a conventional goal of all of our 140,000 employees. Each of our business areas successfully made noteworthy accomplishments this quarter in support of their customers requirements. In Aeronautics, on our Joint Strike Fighter Program, the F-35B Lightning II short take-off/vertical landing aircraft conducted its non-Euro [ph] flight with successful accomplishment of all flight objectives. The STOVL aircraft returned Code One without any flight anomalies and was immediately ready to re-fly. The superb performance of this inaugural flight is a testament to the quality of the aircraft being produced by our worldwide design and manufacturing team. The F-35B flight marks the first flight of an aircraft with a combination of supersonic speed, stealth and STOVL capability and will provide unmatched capabilities for the U.S. Marine Corps and the Royal... and the UK Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. Aeronautics also continue their outstanding quality and manufacturing performance across other aircraft production lines with the F-22, F-16 and C-130J programs delivering increasing numbers of zero defect aircrafts to customers this quarter. This outstanding performance is a direct salvation of our world-class factory efficiency and ongoing pursuit of flawless program execution as we strive to provide customers the highest quality products at the best value. Tuning to Electronic Systems. Our team continued to demonstrate their technological expertise in the increasingly important area of missile defense. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense Weapon System or THAAD successfully detected, tracked and intercepted a separating target. This challenging fits with a strong verification of the target tracking and discrimination capability of the THAAD system. In other missile defense activities, the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Weapon System successfully intercepted short-range unitary ballistic missile target in the terminal phase of its trajectory, further validating the expanding capabilities of the Aegis system. Recent test firings of offensive missiles by international countries illustrate the growing risk of missile proliferation around the world and are creating a significant increase and interest in missile defense systems. This interest is resulting in international customers examining our proven systems for potential deployment to protect their national interests. Space Systems continued to achieve significant accomplishments, both on Earth and beyond. The Phoenix Mars Lander spacecraft successfully landed on Mars and began its science mission research regarding environment suitable for life and the history of water on the planet. Experiments completed to date have confirmed the existence of frozen water and the spacecraft continues to conduct other scientific analysis. Closer to home, but also in space, the first telecommunication satellite for the nation of Vietnam was successfully launched this quarter. This satellite enables state-of-the-art communications to all corners of the country and expand the international use of our proven A2100 satellite platform. Finally, the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile for the U.S. Navy achieved its 122nd consecutive successful test launch, a record extending back to 1989. Turning to IS&GS, several key milestones were achieved this quarter and this portion of our portfolio continues to build momentum. Our support of the National Air Traffic System continued with delivery of the newest version of the En Route Automation Modernization Software to five government sites. This software is used to manage the nation's air traffic and build upon our legacy systems on which 60% for the world air traffic flights. IS&GS also achieved initial operating capability of a key data storage module for the National Archives and Records Administration. This module will be used by the executive office to electronically process and store key data in the National Archives. This major initiative enables the move to government-wide electronic records preservation. The system will capture electronic information regardless of format, save it permanently and make it accessible on future generations of hardware and software. This is a direct application of our diverse information technologies and systems integration capabilities. In addition to program execution, another essential component in our drive for expansion of shareholder value is our success in winning new business. Significant new business awards were achieved this quarter and I will highlight a few of the most noteworthy new contract wins. In Space Systems, new awards include their successful receipt of a $1.4 billion contract from the U.S. Air Force to build the next-generation global positioning system called GPS III. This award builds upon our demonstrative legacy of the success on prior GPS systems. This program will improve position, navigation and timing services for war fighters and civilian users worldwide and provide advanced anti-jam capabilities, superior system security, accuracy and reliability. We are honored to have been selected to construct these critical national assets with delivery scheduled over the next decade. Aeronautics new business wins continued from both domestic and international customers. On the Joint Strike Fighter Program, we received the authorization of $2.2 billion for six conventional takeoff and landing aircraft for U.S. Air Force under the Low-Rate Initial Production Lot 2 contract. Based on the recent successful STOVL flight, we expect a near-term award under LRIP 2 for six STOVL aircraft for the U.S. Marine Corps. Additionally, over $200 million were received for long lead funding for 19 additional F-35 aircrafts under LRIP 3. These awards enable us to move forward and continue our production ramp up on the F-35 program. Aeronautics also received a work in the U.S. Air Force for six C-130J aircraft for special operation forces. This award demonstrates the strong user community support and validation of the proven capabilities of this aircraft and began the critical recapitalization of the Air Force's 18 fleet of CTOL [ph] and special operation forces C-130s. The high operational tempo and ageing of existing airlift assets make it increasingly important to expand our national airlift fleet. The FY08 GWOT supplemental budget recently approved $2.9 billion to purchase up to 34 new C-130J aircraft to help address this critical airlift shortage. Internationally, Aeronautics successfully secured an award from Morocco for the purchase of 24 F-16 aircrafts. This marks the first sale of F-16 aircraft to Morocco and expands the global footprint of this multi-role fighter to 25 countries around the world. This award is expected to enable extension of the F-16 production line to at least 2013 and demonstrates the continuing viability and ongoing new business opportunities for this aircraft. The F-16 program continues to generate new order interest from current and new international customers as they take proven cost effective solutions for their fighter aircraft requirements. The Electronic Systems segment, expanded their international presence with the award of a contract to provide turnkey military flight training to the U.K. Royal Air Force, Navy and Army Air Force. This 25 year effort will be performed in our joint-venture between Lockheed Martin and VT Group and has a potential order value in excess of $1 billion. Electronic Systems also received a $107 million contract in U.S Air Force and Australian Air Force for a seventh production lot of the JASSM cruise missile. This award serves as a validation of the re-certification of the program after recent successful flight tests prove the reliability and capability of the missile across a wide variety of targets. The JASSM program has potential production quantities in excess of 4,000 missiles and should provide significant long-term sales opportunities from U.S and international defense customers. Finally, our IS&GS segment continued to develop momentum in key areas. In early July, we received an award worth $1.2 billion for the integrated hiring operations and personnel program from the Transportation Security Administration. The work to be performed will include recruitment, hiring, payroll and benefit administration for TSA personnel previously performed by three separate companies. Our effort will include streamlining and integrating these previously separate activities. This builds upon our prior strength in providing integrated human resource administration systems to other government agencies. Also in the quarter, the protest for the FBI's Next-Generation Identification System contract was resolved and work resumed on the program. This 10-year $1 billion contract had been awarded in the first-quarter of this year. This resumption of work enabled us to move forward in providing state-of-the-art, multi-modal biometric systems needed by local, state and federal authorities. Finally, IS&GS was awarded a contract to support the U.S. Navy's Joint Medical Information System. This system will provide key information assurance capabilities, including network operations, security and identity management. These awards demonstrate how IS&GS continues to broaden its customer footprint by offering cost effective and innovative solutions. These wins across all of our business segments show the broad customer support of our products and have us well positioned and on track for increased revenue growth in 2009 and beyond. Beyond our success in new business awards this quarter, we also continue to execute our strategy of making acquisitions that provide us with new technology, capabilities or customer access. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Eagle Group International. Eagle is a proven provider of integrated logistics, information technology, healthcare services and base operations support to the U.S. Department of Defense. Their work is primarily in support of the U.S. Army activities here in the United States and will be managed by our IS&GS segment. These highlights demonstrate our strong program and operational execution, solid win rate and financial performance. This results in the positive business outlook have us solidly position to continue our momentum as we deliver increased value to shareholders and customers. Finally, we are proud to be recognized by Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine as the Best-Performing Large-Cap Aerospace Company in their recently released top-performing companies study. Our high scorers in all four measurement categories of financial health, return on invested capital, earnings momentum and asset management underscore our daily focus and commitment to provide value to shareholders is a direct reflection of our talented work force. Now, we'd like to open up the lines for your questions. Rufus, if you would, please open the lines. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions]. And for our first question, we go to George Shapiro with Citi.
George D. Shapiro - Citi Investment Research (US): Hi good morning Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning George.
George D. Shapiro - Citi Investment Research (US): If you could go through a little bit in the Aero business, I mean obviously F-16 sales were down based on the deliveries and they will probably go down similar. But where did JSF stand in F-22 and C-130 was up despite same amount of deliveries. So, can you just provide a little more color there and then also the performance issue that was mentioned on the C-5?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Yes, you are right George. As I look at the Aeronautics business area, let's start-off with the F-16 program first. We were down quarter-over-quarter compared to 2007 five aircrafts. I think, I teed [ph] on previous calls that we had 41deliveries last year and we are moving to... around 28 this year. Five of that reduction was in the first quarter and the other eight are pretty evenly split between the third and fourth quarter, so that really drove the reduction there. F-35 was actually fairly close, fairly flat to where we were in the prior quarters. So, I don't see a lot of change there. F-22 slight downer, but not much there, pretty flat as well. We actually had some good growth in our other sustainment business, which also contributed to the margin growth there, and obviously the performance on our legacy production programs, C-130J, F-16 and F-22 was strong, and significant and that led to the improvement in the margins there on those three programs. The C-5 issue that you brought up, we did talk about that. I would characterize this as dealing with an early transition from a development program to production program. I should add that we have had a multi-year very successful development program on the C-5 program for both the RERP, which is the replacement of the engines and the reliability enhancement part of the program as well as the Avionics Modernization Program, those are concluding very well. We have three aircraft and test program, they are all coming out very well. This issue is on the very first lot , the production contract. There is only one aircraft in this lot. And again I would kind of characterize this as an early production issues primarily associated with the amount and timing of expenditures on our tooling required to perform the contract as well as just achieving our basic learning curve expectations on the first lot of the production build cycle. Look at the... at the end of day, this is... production programs are what we do well, especially in the Aeronautics business, and I think we are going to get this right coming out of here.
George D. Shapiro - Citi Investment Research (US): And a follow-up Bruce, why wouldn't you sit there and if you had to take the issue with only one plane and Lot 1 on the C-5, I mean, why won't you spread that over bigger lots... other lots?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We are into contract for the first lot right now George and that's as per contract accounting that's the way we reflect it in accordance with accounting works..
George D. Shapiro - Citi Investment Research (US): Okay. Thanks very much.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Thank you George.
Operator: And we go next to Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Good morning Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Rob. How are you?
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Yes thanks. Just on the F-22, this is sort of follow-up to that. What point is the commitment date on future aircraft beyond the contract, don't you nearing that point?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me talk just kind of broader terms first. We are still in the middle of the multi-year contract and that multi-year contract runs with deliveries through the end of 2011 and think of it taking about three years from contract award to delivery of aircraft. So towards the end of 2008 is the timeframe. The end of this year is the timeframe, and we will need to have a decision as far as whether or not we are going to get advance by money or lot of lead funds to procure lots beyond the current multi-year time frame.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: So something like October?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We actually go little later than that, but yes I think it is within fiscal year '09 budget time frame.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Okay. And then just on Space, it looks like the second half of the year, we have a sequential sales decline from the first half kind of flattish I guess with last year, can you talk a little bit about that?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Space was up to your point. In the first half of the year, we actually had some... additional satellite launches in the first half of the year. We actually have zero deliverable items in the second half of the year of '08 whereas we had three in the second half of 2007. So that's... I think there is... I know it's tracking pretty much according to plan, but for those delivery events, two satellites in this third quarter, and one in the fourth quarter of last year, zero in the third quarter of this year and zero in the fourth quarter of this year.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Thanks very much for the help Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet Rob.
Operator: We'll go next to Troy Lahr with Stifel Nicolaus.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus: Thanks. Just another follow-up on this last Space question there. I mean, how quickly is GPS III going to start ramping up and are you going to start seeing growth this year out of that program?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: GPS III is, I think, starting off very well. We're having... had our meetings with the customers to get our strategies together and to get our plans in place, baselines in place and the like and get our customer buying to those approaches. I don't see huge levels of growth in 2008 associated with that bid, but I would expect that to be more significant in 2009 and beyond.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay. And then why the margin fall off in the back half at Space also, I didn't... I wasn't quite following that. Is that just kind of volumes or is that the mix ramping up on GPS III some lower margin contracts?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. We had... we have one item in the first quarter where we had a contract, we had a successful negotiation on a permitting contract. We don't expect that to replicate in the second half and pretty much anything else is fairly constant, maybe a little bit of balancing around with the... our cost plus contracts performance there, but I don't see that as any kind of issue from first quarter to second quarter... from first half to second half there. We should also add... I should add... Troy, we also add in the first half, we did have the one commercial satellite, which had quite a bit of improvement over the commercial satellite in the second quarter of last year quarter-over-quarter.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay. But at Space, I mean, should we be thinking Orion CEV is kind of flat now or are you still seeing growth out of that program?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We are still seeing growth out of Orion going forward.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay. Thank you guys.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Troy.
Operator: For our next question, we go to David Strauss with UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: Good morning, Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Dave.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: The growth you're seeing out of your sustainment business there are not, is that C-130, F-16, what else is in there? You gain any benefit from some of these performance-based logistics contracts you have recently signed up?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, we are seeing pretty much broad brushed growth in our sustainment business scenario, not extent of that is we continue to... as we field more and more F-22 units, we continue to see the F-22 sustainment business growing. We are still seeing growth in the C-130 business, you might recall the discussion we had earlier, in the first quarter I believe, about the Canadian deal, where we got a 20-year sustainment contract to keep the Canadian C-130Js flying up there. We are also seeing, which may not be on your radar, we are also seeing growth, we've got some activity, we just recently started putting additional wings on the P-3 aircraft and we are seeing some international activity there both in Norway as well as with the U.S. government with some of their customs and border patrol aircraft. So pretty much again broad brushed support for sustainment, and now they are going in the right direction for us.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: And your margins in the sustainment business, are they meaningfully better than kind of the 12% average margin, so far or not?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I always like to characterize the margin that levels, it's been fairly consistent with the overall margin within the business area.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: Okay, fair enough. And your pension plan performance in the first of the year, what is that roughly?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, as you might expect, if you like at your own portfolio, [inaudible] it hasn't been as high, if we like it to have been, are not yet on track for 8.5% after return that we'd hope for the year, but it's too yearly to tell. We will make the decision as far as what the expectations are after the end of the year. Performances has actually been a little better than the market in general, but not up to the 8.5%.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: Okay. Well, congratulations for that.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, thank you David.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: We will go next to Richard Safran with Goldman Sachs.
Richard Safran - Goldman Sachs: Good Morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Rich.
Richard Safran - Goldman Sachs: Just first thing and I fully recognize now you don't give quarterly guidance, but if we take a look at 3Q, it looks like you finished delivering commercial satellites just about. F-16s as you mentioned before are down and you had an extra week in 1Q, which will be offset by one less week in the third quarter. So, my question is how much pressure, is there being... pressure being put on your third quarter results?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, two comments, Rich. So, one I guess, you are right. We don't give quarterly guidance, but you're pretty accurate in your assessment of what we think is coming up in the third quarter. I'll try to give kind of a high-level view of where I see the third quarter, maybe a couple of items thrown in at the end as well. We talked about F-16. I think I was pretty clear on that. We are going to be down some eight F-16s in the second half of the year and again, think of that is pretty evenly split between third and fourth quarter. What's probably not apparent is, we still expect to have obviously six C-130J deliveries, but just because of the phasing, the planned phasing of those aircraft deliveries, we expect to see more in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, and I think that's going to have some headwind effect on the third quarter and some [inaudible] in the fourth quarter. You also mentioned the fact that we had zero commercial sats in the third quarter whereas we had two of those in the same time frame in 2007. You mentioned the one less week in 2007, one other item I mentioned is, in Electronic Systems, we actually did have a higher-level deliveries on our kind of delivery recorded sales for things like the MPA aircraft for the U.S Coast Guard, PAC-3 Missiles, fire control systems, et cetera. So, that'll be a little lower in the second half. And just overarching, I would look at third quarter is probably being closer or probably lower than the 2007 level. I'm thinking somewhere in the 10.5, 10.6 level. On the flip side may be of the discussion, I'd like to see if I guess that there is the... potential as we see yesterday, we'd look at the manifesto out there to have two unusual events in the second-half of the year, neither associated with the Proton launches, probably one in the third quarter, and one in the fourth quarter as we said here today and this is not premise to our numbers because they are unusual events. But these are the last two events that allow us to recognize the deferred gains that we talked about before we recognized, we had a little bit of that deferred gain in the first-quarter. This would retire that risk and recognize that deferred gain, probably equally split between third and fourth quarter.
Richard Safran - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. And just last thing is... and just simply. So you raised your ROIC forecast by 1% to 20% ?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Richard Safran - Goldman Sachs: I just wanted to know on the invested... if there was anything there that was benefiting on the invested capital side?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, couple of things. Obviously, the numerator went up because we increased profit on the up side. On the denominator side, we increased cash flow to 100 million bucks and we actually have a little pool to the left on the timing of our cash flow. So, we are seeing a little bit lower invested capital over the time frame there, that's the biggest driver.
Richard Safran - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: All right, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Joe Nadol with JP Morgan.
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan Securities: Thanks Bruce, good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Joe. how are you?
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan Securities: Good. My first question is on the F-35. I heard your comments in your introductory remarks, but... so, lot of conversations you know in the press and such this quarter about schedule, timing of the I guess the next 17 development aircrafts, and international partner competitions. I was just wondering if I guess on those two items, the international competitions and the development schedule of those next bunch of aircrafts, if you could kind of give your latest views.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Maybe I'll start with just kind of an overarching view of the F-35 program in general. I think, hopefully you are aware... I'm sure you are that we just provide the STOVL early in the second quarter, essentially on schedule from a schedule we've put together 18 months, two years ago. So that was gratifying to us. We've now got both the AA-1 version, as we call it and the STOVL aircraft flying that the... the STOVL aircraft has had multiple flights since that initial flight. Both are progressing well, and I think, we are very satisfied with where we are performing on that contract. You talked about the remaining 17 aircrafts in the development contract of the build cycle. I think we are progressing well there as well. I think the next big milestone you will see on the program from a delivery perspective will be the roll out of the first aircraft for the carrier variant aircraft for the U.S. Navy. I believe that is in the latter part of the first quarter or early second quarter of next year. And then we start rolling out aircrafts pretty regularly thereafter in that time frame. So, I think we are progressing well and I don't see anything that causes any alarm there. As far as the international partner status in competitor aircraft evaluations, I think you can fully understand when you're going to spend the kind of money that these countries are in the percentage of their defense budgets on a buy of aircraft as large as the plans of our division. They want to make sure they are getting the best deal and they are evaluating all the [inaudible] and oftentimes that's literally, laws of that country to have these sorts of competitions amongst multiple contractors. So, we're not surprised by that and we are not discouraged by that at all. We think the aircraft is prepare very well in those competitions. We are adding ongoing discussions. I think, there were some... at one of the briefings at Farnborough [ph] which talked about some of the consortium buying discussions we are having with international partners. I think, we're getting good momentum on that discussion front right now. And a lot of talk amongst those eight partners who... they will allow us to build or to develop a more predictable build sequence and build schedule that will add some stability to the firm as we go forward. I'm particularly encouraged quite honestly by the... some of the early indications from some of the non-investment partners, the FMS buyers [ph], and particularly Israel has come forward with an LOR for 25 aircraft and an option for 50 aircrafts. So, I think that's the indication both of the preference for the aircraft and the confidence that the international community is putting in our place to produce these aircrafts on a timely basis.
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan Securities: Okay. Thanks for that. As a second question, you revealed [ph] up a whole bunch of big wins that you've got in the second quarter. Your backlog though was down in the first six months and it was particularly down, I guess in the Electronic Systems. I'm just wondering if you could kind of put that into context. I know, obviously backlog is lumpy and you only show unfunded or total backlog as opposed to just funded. But any color you give in Electronics in particular will be helpful.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Let me try to may be give color on all of the backlog, beyond Electronics. You're right. Electronics was down on the first half basis. I've looked at the profile of the Electronics orders and is this typically the case in Electronic Systems. They are very, very heavily loaded, actually not just in the second half, but actually in the fourth quarter of the year. And an awful lot of those are, I'll say sole source follow-on production contracts like, for instance, the next fiscal-year, award of PAC-3 Missiles, for instance, as one example. So, I don't know that I'm surprised. I'm not surprised by where we sit today, backlog wise in Electronic Systems. I think we've won the competitions that were scheduled to occur at a cliff that we're very satisfied with in terms of our win rate and we've won the strategic wins that we talked about. I did talk about my prepared remarks such as the GPS III , AMF JTRS and other contracts such as that. As I look forward Joe, I expect the third-quarter as I look at our orders profile, we'll probably actually show a drop, a further drop in our backlog and expect to recover in the fourth quarter, and I still do expect to actually grow backlog for the year, year-over-year versus 2007.
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan Securities: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet Joe.
Operator: We'll go next to Myles Walton with Oppenheimer.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Myles.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer: Bruce, I was hoping you can offer some information on '09 in the last few years. On the second quarter call you've been kind enough to provide some pieces on how the next year is shaping up. So, maybe if you are able to do that on top line margin opportunity in EPS growth, I know it's early, but conceptually some of your early thoughts there would be helpful.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: As you will hear in my closing statement, we are obviously going to provide guidance in the third quarter for 2009, but as I have stated today, looking at 2009, I think couple of things, I'll comment on, one is we've looked at Aeronautics and we exceed [ph] for a long time, the drop in the F-16 sales in 2008 and the fact that we believe that will be offset by primarily F-35 growth going forward. We still believe that to be the case, we still believe Aeronautics will come back in 2009 higher than 2008, and probably you know comparable or higher than what we saw in 2007. I think the other three business areas we are still hopeful and strongly believe that the IS&GS business areas are strongest growing business. I still think that's probably a double-digit year-over-year revenue growing business. Electronic Systems is probably kind of steady area for us, always kind of in the mid-single digits and that's why, what I see in 2009, and I think as I have said up in the past that Space is likely to be flat for a couple of years at least including 2009. So that's cost side Myles and then as far as bottom line, I still think there is margin improvement out there on most of our business areas. I think it is becoming more difficult for us, but we've not given up on that, I still think there is opportunity to exceed in that area.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer: Okay. That's really helpful. So, the only other one I had for you is on clarification of the PT&E, I guess charge or the adjustment of performance claim that you mentioned in the press release?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think that was... it was PT&E, are you sure, you're talking PT&E?
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer: It is declines in operating profit at PT&E is due to mainly performance in the second quarter?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. We've had a very strong growth in our PT&E business, quarter-over-quarter very strong top level growth, top line growth and margins are down year-over-year within our PAE Group. Think of that is probably down about a 100 basis points or so. This is really a mix issue, not a performance issue and we're expecting higher margins in the second half. This is a... PAE is a... I'm sorry, you've said PT&E, and I'm talking PAE, don't you Myles.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer: Yeah, that's okay. Within Electronic Systems, there was a commentary in the press release regarding platform training and energy --?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, my apologies... my apologies. I'm giving you different explanation than you asked for. The platform integration piece, but that's what's on the press release, think of this, this is an international electronic warfare contract and this is a contract that has a very, very complicated environment that it operates in incredibly set of difficult requirements. Both we and our subs for that matter have not performed as well as we would have liked and we did have some issues there. This is a single contract. There is no kind of follow-on business from this contract. We simply have not performed very well. We think we have the separate understood, and we think we have the problems behind us at this point.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you. Sorry for the distraction there.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer: No. I'm not worried.
Operator: We go next to Robert Stallard with Macquarie.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Research: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Rob.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Research: Bruce, first of all, on the C-130J. We talked last week about how the prospects of that are looking good and you intend to ramp up production, how do you think that is going to phase in as we move out into 2009 and 2010?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we did talk at Farnborough Rob and I know there was briefing by Ross Reynolds on the program at the Farnborough as well. Now, as we look at the current backlog of the Canadian orders we just recently received, some of the C-130Js I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the GWOT aircraft for instance. We do see a ramp-up taking place on the delivery profiles, the C-130 programs. I have teed up, I think in the past that we think of us as currently delivering about 12 aircraft a year. I do believe that ramp rate will double probably by the end of the decade to the 24 level or even slightly higher than that. And you can... I won't give the... necessarily the ramp rate between those years, but you can imagine that it won't be a fair step... it will be a more leveled progression from where we are now for that doubling of rate.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Research: And do you think as a result of this that you'll be able to realize higher margins on the program as well?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think that certainly sets us up for that Rob and it helps from a... an over rate absorption issue, it's nothing else than that. I think this... this partner is performing exceedingly well. I'd like to see it continue that even with the ramp rate increase we're talking about and that is probably the objective.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Research: Right. And secondly on the Electronic Systems, your guidance suggest that margins ease off a bit in the second half. What do you think is the fact of that like to cause it?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I don't know that I'd see margins slackening off in the second quarter or the second half to be honest. I think they're going to be fairly consistent with what we saw in the first half at the end of the day.
Robert Stallard - Macquarie Research: Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We go next to Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: Hi, good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Doug.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: Hi. If we go back to Sats for a minute, when you look at Orion, Orion being up, military satellites being down. If you take out ULA for a moment, how margins trended there? And ULA was obviously a big contributor in margins.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well let's see, for our second quarter or first quarter or all the above?
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: The second quarter.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Just second quarter. I think our Sats business has actually improved over from... the second quarter of '08 and second quarter of '07. We had some nice... I think I mentioned earlier, nice improvement on our commercial satellite that we launched this quarter, compared to what we did last year. It's actually a very good program for us. That was the biggest driver and everything else I will say on the government business, the Orion contracts and the like... is fairly flat. Profit wise, margin wise and then the ULA contract as you mentioned is actually the other piece that's getting up some margin boosts in the quarter.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. And then on IS&GS, you mentioned the global services that you've seen some weakness in the margin there and that's a mix issue.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: Could you comment perhaps a little bit more on that on the mix issue and then as well you mentioned a contract restructuring in the information services area as well. What was the impact of that?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me start with the PAE first. I apologize, again I started giving this response to Myles. I'll try to give a similar response to you Doug.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: That's okay. That was my question. Where did you got started on it?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Getting a good head start here. I think I'll start to say... the margins were down year-over-year. I think somewhere in the neighborhood of about 100 basis points or so. And this really is not a performance matter and there has been no write-offs or those sort of things. It has been a mix issue. We're having extremely high growth at the top line, but most of the contracts we see happening on PAE are what we call the ID/IQ contracts and definite delivery and definite quantity contracts. Those have a tendency, not a tendency, but those are tend to be recorded from a sales recognition perspective be a service contract accounting. And that tends to create more variability between the quarters especially at the early start of those programs then in the later part. I don't see that being an issue and again I think margins are going to improve in line with our expectations in the second half of the year just as planned. I am sorry your second question, I didn't --?
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: On the information services, you referred to a contract restructuring that you benefited from.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I think we actually mentioned that in the first quarter. And I think that's probably in the press release talking about the first half of the year.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: So there is nothing new there.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There is nothing new. We did have a contract restructuring in the first quarter. It was a fairly, had much more impact in the first quarter but it does actually benefit us in second and beyond as well.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: But I take it on margins that's not a material impact on the second quarter in terms of your...
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, it's not.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, great. Thank you.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Doug.
Operator: We go next to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Yes, you performed very well in the Aeronautical sector.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Was sustainment up... given that I guess, sustainment is going to continue to rise and the F-16 down a little, but you know the mix going forward looks about the same. What's the chance that the margin in the second half there could be close to where you were in the second quarter?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Close to what we're in the second quarter you said.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Right, or at least that... your guidance for the year just on paper, it looks like it has some opportunity.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. As I look forward, Cai, the big drivers that are going to make its margin improvement for the second half for the same things we've been talking about for the last 18 months or so, and that's the big three production programs, the F-16, F-22 and the C-130J. I will tell you those programs are performing superbly, collectively and individually. And assuming that we continue the kind of improvement going forward in the second half of the year, I think we have opportunities to have improvements there. I think your question of, could we get to the second half margins and I think it's possible. But we have to continue that kind of performance levels we've seen in the past to make that happen.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Okay. And then, I guess cash redeployment, you raised your op cash flow target for the year, you had good cash flow. In this quarter, any kind of sense in terms of priorities, are you seeing more in terms of on the M&A front more interested in the tough market buying your stock and how do you look at that?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, just thinking a while Cai, I would think that we would see some reduced level of share repurchases in the second half. That's obviously dependent upon what the stock does. I mean we're still bullish on our stock or we will be buying at the levels we are. And depending on what happens to the second half that will determine what we do with more or less share repos. We don't intend to have the option exercised in the ESOP contributions for our plan, dilute the share count, so you will see at least purchases for that level in the second half. Again the rest will be probably dependent upon what the share prices do for the rest of the year. Relative to your second question I'm sorry Cai was the...
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: In terms of... if in fact you're going to decelerate the share repurchase even though you kind of have the debt, but that issue you still have very substantial cash flow. Any...
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Any parts of with greater interest in M&A?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. I think we obviously take a look at the fourth quarter at our dividend policy and that's a decision we'll discuss with the Board at that time. But relative to M&A, I do see, as I look at the pipeline of what we have got hopefully on our horizon. I do think we're going to see more opportunities for M&As in the last six months, it wouldn't surprise me if we do two to four kind of with the smallest level of acquisitions that we have done in the past and get those closed in the second half of the year.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Great, thank you very much.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Operator: We will go next to Ronald Epstein with Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Good day, and good morning Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Ron.
Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch: A question for you with regard to the Aegis System. There has been a lot of talk in the press men on the hill about the kind of the face off between DDT-51and DDT 1000. If we were to see the DDT 1000 go away and see more 51, what's the net opportunity for Lockheed?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, the net opportunity in the DD... the Aegis Weapon System which is kind of the backbone of the DDT destroyer. First off, it's performed superbly over the past few years and it's grown, its capabilities have grown immensely from kind of a anti-aircraft tracking... missile tracking system towards now very effective as of that, and I have spent a last few launches we've had with Ballistic Missile Defense. So, I think that the weapon system has grown capability wise, we've also been able to shrink its footprint to have it to be usable starting with cursors down to destroyers now to frigates, including in the international market place. So it's a very flexible, very capable system first off. Relative to our possibilities going forward, we were looking at doing Aegis sorts of retrofits, find out the right word, but enhancements on the existing fleet of Aegis Systems to begin with. This would be over and above that obviously. My reaction, I guess, is the Navy like every other service had it's one set of budget pressure. I am sure that's why they're exploring this option and quite honestly, we stand ready to support the Navy in its decision.
Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then if I can just follow-on with another question. Could you just give us some more color on maybe what your launching list of upcoming programs would be and what we can keep an eye on for potential things you are competing for?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Again, third-quarter, let's just talk that I mentioned in the prepared remarks the IHOP contract that actually is the third quarter event, it was not reflected in the second quarter numbers that it was... we really I think we won that July 3rd. So that's a big big win... continuing the trend of large significant wins within our IS&GS business area. We've a... a fairly large opportunity, I think GSAT, probably three months ago or so, I'm not sure I would have stopped. But, that had quite as much as opportunity to be an award this year . But, I think the current thinking, the current planning on the part of the customer is that as of September, possibly a later fourth quarter award, that's one that you want to be watching there. From a kind of a strategic perspective, we do expect probably at the end of this summer, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle down select from six to three players on the tech demo phase to occur and we are going to watch that closely... you want to watch that as well. I'm hopeful , I think I teed up and in terms that I was wrong, but I teed up in the second quarter that is up that we would give hopefully get a C-130 international contracts signed in the second quarter. I think that's still a possibility in the third quarter without naming... names there for probably think of it up to four C-130s or so. And then we've also get the DOE Hanford contract which is a large another large competition for the IS&GS business area in the third quarter. Fourth quarter, we think there is... the large weather satellite for NOVA, the GOES-R satellite is upcoming. We are hopeful, although it's... I'm a little bit of cusp on whether or not it can happen this year or not, that we will get some positive news on Romania for F-16s. And then maybe finally, I did mention in the third quarter, we're hopeful will there be a down select on the JAGM, the Joint Air-to-Ground Missile competition that we are pretty excited about as well. So that's a handful, that's sort of the larger ones that I see on the horizon and hope those ones you will track with us.
Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Great, super. Thank you.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Ron.
Operator: We'll go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies & Company.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies and Company: Thank you. Returning to cash flow for a moment Bruce. Your customer advances for the first six months are essentially flat relative to a source of I think $700 million a year ago. How would you see the second half playing out, I mean that clearly will make your already strong numbers look a little better?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Thank you Howard. First, let's just talk on working capital in general. I think we talked in the first quarter and there was some concern about the high level of accounts receivable we saw in the first quarter and the high working capital growth. We teed up the notion that we thought... we'd see improvement in both AR and as a result in working capital in the second quarter, that's exactly what happened. As I look at the second half of the year, I actually see some growth, probably to the $0.5 billion level or so in our working capital account. Most of that growth coming as a result of lower advances occurring. So, I think that is probably a delta of about $200 million or $250 million between now and the end of the year.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies and Company: And that's not... that's pretty good precision, given the volatility in that business. With respect to international, there are a number of foreign military sales that are outstanding. You know, some that you alluded to and some that are in the pipeline. Do you find that the negotiations are taking a little bit longer, let's say in some of the non-aeronautical areas or is it... is it just, is it just the typical lumpy nature of the business?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I would, honestly Howard, characterize... I mean, I worked most of my career in parts of the business that had large contents of international business and the one constant is the fact that it is hard to predict when international customers are going to buy their products. I don't see this as the ordinary out of the expected results, and I am not aware of any sort of peculiar stretching out associated with international sales.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies and Company: Thank you. And then just... if we were to look at your programs, I mean it was good that you highlighted a couple of challenges. As you look at your entire list of programs, are there still just a handful of red ones or is there anything really changed where red is gone to yellow or green?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We're talking internally about kind of the headline partners, the ones that kind of catch people's eye or peoples attention and they are the usual suspects, right, I mean, get the VH-71, LCS and lot of programs like that, the Cyprus contract. I can honestly say as I look at those contracts from where we were at the start of the year, I think each and everyone of those contracts is doing better today than it was at the start of this year. And I am very encouraged by the trend that we see in those high profile contracts. I teed up or we just discussed two programs in the second here. The C-5 and the platform integration electronic warfare program that kind of popped up, those things happen, is a charge off to try to minimize those and stretch those out, so they don't happen as regularly as we prefer it does not happen. But we are talking still just a handful of contracts, I don't think any performance issue besides that.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies and Company: Thank you very much Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Howard.
Operator: We will go next to Harry Nourse with Banc of America Securities
Harry Nourse - Banc of America Securities: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Harry.
Harry Nourse - Banc of America Securities: Hi. Can you just remind us when how far out your F-16 backlog stretches to?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. With the award of the Moroccan deal... and first up I think we are standing at about a 115 aircraft in backlog and that kind of the current build rate that takes us out somewhere towards the end of 2013, I believe. So, it's a good long time still to go and again I sit back in amazement sometime as I look at the F-16 program. I started my career in that program you know and that production wise that started in production phase in probably 1978. Here we are at 2008, and we just settle to our 25th international customer, when the program is still is vibrant today as it was for a number of years back, I am very exited about the opportunities and prospects going forward.
Harry Nourse - Banc of America Securities: So obviously the time in these things is outside of your hands. But beyond that on the Romanian thing and also the Indian, are there other things out there that we just don't know about the possibilities as well?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think there's been a lot of news, a lot of press... rather about the potential sale for 66 F-16s in Taiwan. That is clearly been asked for by the new Taiwanese administration. But that's clearly the decision that needs to be embedded [ph] at the government to government level. We are happy to sell the aircraft, but we will only do that obviously if the Department of State feels says that is the right thing to do. But that's that 66 aircraft either would have happened, it would happen at the very late part of this year or sometime early next year and also slightly going to get pushed off or deferred into the next administration.
Harry Nourse - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And on that F-22, obviously the decision has moved off into the next administration, what level of commitment might you have to provide to keep the line going?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Commitment, do you mean financial commitment?
Harry Nourse - Banc of America Securities: Yeah.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we have not committed to do anything financially, to keep the line going quite honestly.
Harry Nourse - Banc of America Securities: Yeah, but would you, in the absence of orders?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'd say what, we're not going to make like F-22s, I can tell you that much. And if can figure out a way to minimize the build... sequence of the build timing the schedule, how long it takes to build an F-22, or if there is some low dollar suppliers that would build us some time frame there, we might look at that, but we're not talking anything of any size whatsoever.
Harry Nourse - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Jerry F. Kircher, III - Vice President, Investor Relations: Rufus, this is Jerry. I think we are coming up on the time. Maybe one more question and we wrap up.
Operator: [inaudible] will come from Joe Campbell with Lehman Brothers.
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: Actually, good morning it's Carter Copeland. Good morning, Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Carter, how are you?
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: Good. Just pigging back a bit and I've got a question on M&A and you did talked about opportunities for a couple of things in the second half. I wondered if you might characterize as some of the things you're seeing in terms of the attitude of potential sellers, I mean obviously valuations have come in a bit here, are you seeing expectations change given where the budget outlook stands and given where some of the various opportunities within the budget stand. Are people more or less willing to sell or what sort of things are you seeing in general, from sellers?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Just an overarching view, we have had a tendency to look at a lot of private deals here recently, and I still think we're seeing potential opportunities in the private arena that we are excited about, and I think those deals, we wouldn't be doing it, if we didn't think they are reasonable. I don't know that we saw the huge variation swings in terms of valuation in the private market that maybe we did in some of the public market particularly with some of the international money chasing, some of the public deals. So, we have not seen that, that's not the element that we are targeting in any event and I've not seen that.
Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers: Great thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Operator: And with that Mr. Tanner, I will turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I do appreciate the time. I'd like to close by thanking you for your questions and for joining the call. We look forward to talking to you again in October when we discuss our 2009 financial outlook and guidance. Rufus that concludes our call.
Operator: Thank you sir. And again ladies and gentleman this does conclude the Lockheed Martin Corporation second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. We do appreciate your participation and you may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Lockheed Martin Corporation First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Kircher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jerry Kircher - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone, I would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call is Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. We have posted charts on our website today which is a supplement to our comments. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. Consistent with our expectations, we had an excellent first quarter and are off to a strong start for the year. Our results reflect solid operating performance across the corporation, driven by our focus on program execution as we deliver value to our customers. Our world-class employees and leadership team continued our momentum by delivering critical services and products to our customers. During the first quarter, we achieved progress in providing value to shareholders, winning new business and executing on programs for our customers. As our press release outlined, first quarter results across the corporation were strong. Our earnings per share grew by 9% on a reported basis and 24% on a recurring basis. We had solid margin expansion with a 70 basis point increase in segment operating margins helping drive our earnings growth. This margin expansion is the result of successful risk reduction activities and strong performance on key programs. These same factors enabled us to generate almost $900 million in cash from operations in the quarter. One key component of our cash deployment strategy is share repurchases. We are continuing to execute our stated practice of making opportunistic share purchases. During the first quarter, we repurchased 11.3 million shares for $1.2 billion. This represents the highest quarterly purchase level in terms of dollars in corporate history, and reduced our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter to just under 417 million shares, achieving a reduction of over 15 million shares since the first quarter of 2007. Our remaining repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter was over 21 million shares or approximately $2.2 billion at current market values. During the first quarter, we also paid a dividend to shareholders of $172 million. As a result of the dividend payment and our quarterly repurchase activity, we are well positioned to achieve our commitment to return at least half of our annual free cash flow to shareholders for the sixth consecutive year. We are once again solidly on track to deliver strong annual financial results in 2008. Based on our first quarter results, we have increased 2008 guidance for earnings per share and return on invested capital while maintaining our other prior financial estimates. Today's press release and our supporting webcast charts outline the details of our new guidance. Another important catalyst in our ability to provide value to shareholders is our ability to win new business. Key new business awards were achieved this quarter across all business segments. Our IS&GS business area had a particularly strong quarter, highlighted by their win of the AMF JTRS program. Initial contract award was for $0.75 billion to provide tactical communications and networking to the US Air Force, Army, Navy, and other users. This program has multi-billion dollar future sales potential as radio systems are deployed across this broad user community. IS&GS also won a 10-year $1 billion contract from the FBI to develop and maintain the next generation identification system. This program will provide state-of-the-art multimodal biometric systems for use by local, state and federal authorities. This contract award, however, was recently placed under protest and we have not yet included it in our backlog. These wins demonstrates that our IS&GS segment continues to differentiate itself from competitors by leveraging their organizational framework and offering cost effective and innovative solutions to customers. As a result, IS&GS expanded its backlog award to record levels and is well positioned to generate robust organic sales growth in 2008. Our Electronic Systems segment continued to expand its international work with the award of a $200 million contract from the UK Ministry of Defense for the Land Environment Air Picture Provision program. This program will provide ground troops with a new level of situational awareness. Further international expansion was achieved with France's selection of our HELLFIRE II missile for use on their Army helicopter fleet. Their selection marks the first time that the HELLFIRE missile has been sold to France and is another demonstration of the strong international demand for our proven products. Aeronautics also achieved important new business awards this quarter. The C-130J program received orders for eight new aircraft with the purchase of two tanker aircraft for the US Marine Corps and six aircrafts for India. In addition, Aeronautics received approval from the DoD to proceed with the low rate initial production for the C-5 RERP program to modernize a total of 49 C-5 aircraft potentially valued at $5 billion. This program will greatly enhance mission readiness rates and assure continued service from these critical national airlift assets for years to come. Finally, our Space Systems segment received a $350 million contract for long-lead activities for the third SBIRS satellite and the third highly elliptical earth orbit payload. These orders further expand our work on this vital element for a national missile warning and defense system. One of the primary drivers in our ability to secure these new business wins is our focus on program execution. Significant achievements were made this quarter across our portfolio of programs and I'll highlight a few of those noteworthy accomplishments. In electronic systems, our successes include the delivery of three missionized maritime patrol aircraft and an HC-130J surveillance aircraft as part of the Deepwater program for the US Coast Guard. These aircraft will greatly enhance deployed assets and surveillance capabilities on this important modernization program. Also this quarter, our Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Weapon System was used by the US Government to destroy an errant satellite and eliminate the danger of an uncontrolled re-entry of this nonfunctioning satellite. Other achievements this quarter included progress on the Littoral Combat Ship with successful power on of key propulsion and electrical systems. We look forward to the completion of our ship and the commencement of sea trial evaluations by the US Navy later this year. We believe the delivery of LCS #1 will validate our innovative design and demonstrate the capabilities of this world-class solution for the Littoral mission. International interest in our ship remains high with multiple countries evaluating our platform for their future naval requirements. Electronic Systems also continues to make progress on the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter program. Under the Increment I contract, we have begun integration of mission systems aboard the third test vehicle and have completed nearly 700 flight hours on all program test vehicles. Additionally, we are currently meeting all key performance parameters, including weight, range and speed of the aircraft. Delivery of these new critical assets to the President and Navy is expected to occur in 2010. In Space Systems, we have successfully launched our sixth GPS 2R satellite and achieved operational status in record time. Our demonstrated track record on this program has us well positioned for the upcoming multi-billion dollar award for the next generation GPS III program. Also this quarter, Space achieved a major milestone of 200 cumulative years of successful payload operations for the A2100 satellite fleet, validating the proven reliability of our platform. Turning to aeronautics, I would like to provide a status report on our largest program, the Joint Strike Fighter. We are continuing our progress on the SPD development contract for the three aircraft variants. Our developed progress to date is validating that the design decisions we made early in the program are resulting in aircraft that are achieving all key performance parameters. The first conventional takeoff aircraft is progressing through the fight test program with 40 flights completed to date and has exceeded performance and reliability expectations. In over 80% of these test flights, the aircraft has returned code one or immediately ready to re-fly, demonstrating a level of reliability unheard of at this stage of flight test program. Additionally this quarter, the aircraft successfully completed aerial refueling trials, another milestone in a series that will lead to longer range flight tests and first production deliveries in 2010. The STOVL aircraft also continues to progress through final fabrication and remains on track to deliver... to achieve its inaugural flight later this quarter. The engine was powered up for the first time on April 17th, a key step in verifying its readiness for first flight. The upcoming first flight will consist of a conventional takeoff and landing profile, per the original test plan. Later this year or in early 2009, we will be conducting the first short take off, vertical flight of the aircraft. All 17 remaining development aircraft are in various stages of assembly at our manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. We are realizing learning curve improvements from our completed aircraft and components that are comparable to legacy F-16 and F-22 programs while achieving quality levels that are significantly higher than either program at similar stages of production. The carrier variant aircraft for the US Navy continues under development and remains on schedule for factory rollout in 2009. The carrier variant will help transform the US Navy by placing fifth generation fighters in a position to reach enemy targets without ferrying or refueling due to the tremendous fuel capacity of the aircraft. Risk reduction activities are also being accomplished with ongoing flight tests of our Cooperative Avionics Flying Test Bed. This aircraft is outfitted with all the F-35 sensors and software integrated and fused to retire avionics risk that have traditionally plagued legacy programs. By significantly accelerating the development and integration of the avionics system, this test bed will also help collaboration of the F-35. The test bed is on track to complete its first fully missionized flight later this year, a full year before the fully missionized F-35. In addition to our ongoing development contract activities, we are fully funded and making excellent progress on the first low rate initial production contract. This contract is for construction of the first two aircraft for the US Air Force. We had also been previously funded to procure long lead items under the second LRIP contract for six more aircrafts to the Air Force and six aircrafts to the Marines. Recently in recognition of the progress being achieved on the program, the Defense Acquisition Board approved full funding for the six LRIP 2 CTOL aircraft with the balance of the full funding for the six STOVL aircraft to be released after a successful inaugural flight. Looking forward, the proposed FY '09 budget contains a request for LRIP 3 production for 16 aircraft, equally split between Air Force and Marine versions and reflects a continuing ramp up in production quantities. In the critical area of cost performance, we remain intensely focused on aircraft affordability for our domestic and international customers, helping ensure that we deliver the world's first multi-role, fifth generation stealth fighter to customers at affordable levels. International interest in the Joint Strike Fighter remains strong with our eight international partners continuing to make assessment of commitments and investments to the production phase of the program. Elsewhere within aeronautics, outstanding manufacturing and quality performance is being achieved across all three of our other aircraft production lines. Aeronautics' ongoing pursuit of knowledge program execution on the F-22, F-16, and C-130J programs is resulting in our delivery of increasing numbers of zero defect aircrafts. This performance is providing differentiating solutions to our customers and future financial opportunities for shareholders. With that, I'd like to open the call... open the lines for your questions. Stacy, please open the call. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Good morning, guys.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Robert. How are you?
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Good, thanks. Wanted to ask you, Bruce, you talked about the 50% return of cash generated, free cash generated, you've done really almost half of that here in the first quarter, you talked about that. So how should we think about that number going forward, especially since here in the second quarter, your average share price is below what you paid in the first quarter?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think we've got a fairly long standing policy that says we are going to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases or dividends. And I think we're... as you pointed out, we are well on that track as we look at where we are today. We'll take a look at all options coming up, we'll take a look at dividends probably in the fourth quarter as we typically do. I like having the flexibility where we sit right now and it just depends from an opportunistic perspective, Robert, what lays out in front of us. If we see some acquisition opportunities we like, we may take a different path. If we don't, we may continue with the share repurchase program. So, it's much more opportunistic than I can kind of predict at this point in time.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Yes, because you’ve down almost 1.4 in the first quarter with the share repurchases and the dividend and half the free cash for the year would be 1.6, 1.7.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Not far at all.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: The other question I had for you is on your sales guidance relative to last year. It's fairly modest, you grew around 70% in the first quarter. Clearly F-16, you've talked about that's coming down. I think you said last call you do about 20 to 28 of those, this year you did nine in Q1. Can you talk a little bit about the sales trend as we go through the rest of the year?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We talk about for aeronautics or for the total whole business areas?
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Entire business, but certainly we do understand that aeronautics plays a big role here?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. We did here… you're actually, right. I think I mentioned 28 aircrafts on the call last time. First quarter is probably the highest quantity of aircraft we're going to see. It drops consecutively from that point down. Fourth quarter will be the lowest quarter in the year for us, 16 deliveries. As I look at Aero going forward, I expect a little bit flat probably for the next couple of quarters and I do expect still the fourth quarter to be probably the lowest quarter in the year, consistent with the expectations that we provided on previous calls. Again, I think we are talking that being down about sort of around the $850 million range from last year. That's still what we see as we look going forward. Space, they've got a couple of POT and in fact that already happened. We had a launching of satellite, both of that in the second quarter. Those are the last two POT items for us, our passage of title items, units of delivery, methodology, sales event. So, we'll probably see a little bit of a spike in space in the second quarter, then a flattening out going forward. [inaudible] slight growth quarter-over-quarter to the, I think, the guidance midpoint within the 3% to 5% range. I think we're on track for that. And IS&GS obviously very, very strong in the first quarter at 17%. I suspect they'll have sequential growth through the next three quarters, and still within line with what we talked about in the past, like the range we’ve given you at the mid-point to date of 11, we still we are on the track there as well.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Bruce, thank you for the color. Very helpful.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet. Thanks, Robert.
Operator: Thank you. We will move next to Douglas Harned with Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Doug.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: On IS&GS, because you... you talked about the margins there. I mean the margins are a little lower than you would expect for… given your guidance for the year. And I know you mentioned in your release the benefit of a contract restructuring. Could you talk about how that looks for the year margin wise?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Well, let me talk about the contract restructuring, first. We did have a contract restructuring in the first quarter and as I kind of look at that and the effects of that on the first quarter compared to say the first quarter last year, it's probably somewhere about a $10 million benefit we're seeing net-net in the quarter. The important thing I would like to lead you on, relative to contract restructuring is, this is not a one-time event. This is a contract restructuring over the life of this contract. And we kind of had good indications as we started giving the guidance in the prior-year that this event was going to happen. So really our guidance considers the effect of this when we talked about the margin improvement year-over-year. I still expect to see IS&GS have sequential improvement in its margins quarter-over-quarter. And I still expect consistent with what happened in the fourth quarter of last quarter, the fourth quarter of this year will be our highest margin year. So I am optimistic about our results going forward on IS&GS on a margin basis.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, and then on space, you had particularly good margins there.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: Could you talk about what led to that, is this... are there some one-time items in there?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. We had… we had a one little blue bird that came in, we had a termination of settlement. But we had some folks to make some things happen from a negotiating perspective to make that happen sooner than we expected. So there was a bit of a blue bird opportunity. Most of the benefit we're seeing in space is because of improved performance with the United Launch Alliance, the equity earnings associated with that. We're really seeing quarter-over-quarter significant improvement there, and I think that's just reflective of the fact that we are in fact hitting stride with that organization. It's only worth a little bit over a year-old and we're starting to see good performance coming out it, and this quarter reflected that.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: And so that benefit should be sustainable?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That benefit should be sustainable. That's right.
Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, great. Thank you.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Operator: And we will go next to George Shapiro with Citi.
George D. Shapiro - Citi Investment Research (US): Yes, good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, George.
George D. Shapiro - Citi Investment Research (US): Bruce, you had $500 million increase in receivables. I mean, the cash flow was still pretty good, but less than what we had last year. Can you tell us what happened with the receivables and does that go down the rest of the year?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, good look at it, George. I took a look at receivables myself, I really think this is more a reflection of when the snapshot was taken for measuring receivables. I went back and took a look -- and this is all about -- if I look back to the last five years, I think accounts receivable grew four of those five years in the first quarter. In fact, if I look back at 2007 between first quarter and second quarter of 2007, AR grew by $600 million combined on those two quarters and yet we still had a reduction at the end of the year. So my expectation is that this value will come back down in second quarter, and I actually expect that by the end of the year, we moved close to the 2007 end of year levels than we're right now. I think it's just a pure timing issue.
George D. Shapiro - Citi Investment Research (US): I think you just discussed it, it’s another little thing. You've mentioned you had a loss on marking-to-market some securities. Could you just discuss what that was?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. I think -- there's a couple of things going on here. We have some deferred compensation items that are in investments and there was some loss to mark-to-market in that. That's reflected for those of you on the call. Couple of places, one we had some lower on the liability side, we had another unallocated items down about $25 million that reflects the liability side of it. We also had some loss within embedded, within $100 million reduction in non-operating income. Think of that as about 70%, 75% of that's actually reduction in our interest income in our cash balances. The reminder is the mark-to-market loss that we're talking out there. So, George, the way I kind of think about it is, the mark-to-market loss on the asset was kind of offset by the reduction in the liability, and those are about a push, and net-net it is down because of the interest income on the cash balance on the balance sheet.
George D. Shapiro - Citi Investment Research (US): Okay, thanks a lot.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, George.
Operator: We'll go next to Troy Lahr with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus: Thanks. Can you guys just specifically talk about electronics where you do 11% in the first quarter, but then you are calling for 3% to may be 5% growth the rest of the year, any pull forward there also in electronics?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. We didn't pull forward. There was a... electronics had the benefit of a couple items, I actually mentioned I think on the program execution side. Some of those, in particular, aircraft deliveries for the US Coast Guard, the MPA aircraft and so forth. Those are reported from a sales perspective on a delivery basis or POT basis. So we had the benefit of that. We see a little bit less of those sorts of items in the second quarter, and that's the main reason for that, Troy.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay. And then also I think electronic system, you had two acquisitions last year, August and December. Did that help at all this quarter or were those pretty meaningless?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There was no effect in electronic systems in this quarter due to acquisitions. There is only a slight impact within IS&GS for a little smidge of what we did last year in the first quarter, but electronic systems was completely clean.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay. Thanks guys.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Operator: We'll go next to Joe Nadol with JP Morgan.
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan Securities: Good morning.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Joe.
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan Securities: Hi. On the F-35 program, you've told us in the past that you've been booking around a 4% margin. I was just wondering what's in your plan for the year and what you did in the quarter, is the changing at all?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We didn't change anything in the quarter. And again, Joe, I don't see that happening the rest of the year that would say, suggest, that I'm going to make any changes in the rest of the year either.
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan Securities: Okay. And then secondly, just following up on the cash flow question, wondering if you could give us, maybe by segment, or the segment where you saw less cash flow because I know Q1 is usually a good quarter for you guys. I went back and looked in, I think this was your lowest cash flow... operating cash numbers into 2003, if you want. I mean, I know it's probably just timing, but with the aircraft, with the Aeronautics or where was it?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Just want to give you a couple of cases. You're right, we are down, as I looked at it, we are down by $600 million quarter-to-quarter compared to the first quarter of last year. That is mostly due to the timing of international receipts. Some of those, a lot of those have been aeronautics, but not all of them. But even with the [inaudible] cash quarter-to-quarter, free cash still exceeded that earnings. I think we had about a 1.1 ratio there. I fully expect 2008 is probably a little bit different trend in 2008 maybe than what we've experienced in past years. I expect 2008 to be a little more level loaded in terms of our cash generation. I think each of the next three quarters will probably start with a number with a billion in it. So I think it will be a little... again a little bit more level loaded. But look, at the end of the day, we've had ten consecutive years of free cash flow exceeding net earnings. I fully expect 2008 will follow suit.
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan Securities: Okay, thanks. That's helpful.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Joe.
Operator: We'll move next to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Yes. Thanks so much. You had an extra week, 14 weeks in the first quarter. But you talked on forward about the impact of kind of, A, what impact did that have on this quarter, and what impact will dropping out of the rate have on the third quarter?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Cai. Just to be clear, we have 13 weeks versus 12 last year. I’ve looked at that and I’ve scratched my head a lot to be honest with you as far as what impact that has. I think it has probably the biggest impacting two of our business areas and that's IS&GS and space. But to say, its the full impact is probably overstating it because of the timing of when some of our subcontractors give us fillings in the invoice in the month in particular versus when we bill. So, I don’t feel that we fully lose the full one-week impact there. I think we have had some benefit while we got the 8% in the quarter but to assign a number to that is just difficult to do.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Okay. Terrific. And then two issues in space, first your $57 million in deferred gains in ILS still to go, would you comment kind of when that's going to run-out, how many lunches when we might see it? And secondly, the backlog in space was up substantially more than one would expect from the amount of bookings, maybe give us some color on that front?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me start with the $57 million. That's dependent upon the itineraries, either tied with the old Proton launches. So, it depends upon when the itineraries for those launches are scheduled to go. There is two launches left, that I can be very specific on. And right now I think the -- I think the Proton is under investigation because of the misalignment in the orbit of the last launch there. So, its -- my guess would be, Cai, it’s probably in the latter half of the year. So, I don't... not that I want to give any more specifics on that, because I don't have insight at this point in time to specific itinerary when those launches are going to go up. But I would guess both of them are going to be this year and later in the year. Jumping to your second question, I think backlog was down. So, I am a little confused by your question on space. I think the only business that went up was IS&GS for the year-to-date. So, I must – you must be reading it wrong there. I think we had like $1.9 billion in sale and $1.04 billion in orders. So, I think backlog actually dropped.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: It did, but it was up from the fourth quarter. It was up from the fourth quarter, not year-over-year.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I am doing it for fourth quarter.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: I will double check it.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay, thanks Cai.
Operator: We'll move next to David Strauss with UBS.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: Good morning, thank you.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, David.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: Hi, Bruce. Can you quantify what exactly, how much the gain was in space in the quarter. And then just talk about space margins looking, you kind of touched this before, but tell me, look at space margins on a longer-term basis? I mean this is for the most part a cost reimbursable business where you are now making relatively high margins.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Okay. So, start with the space gain, I think you are talking about the blue bird I talked about earlier.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: Right.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, that’s… think of that in… the overall improvement we saw at the end of the year that I committed to in the new guidance, think of that as probably at or about a third or so of that number and the rest of it’s really due to ULA. And again, the ULA I will expect to continue throughout the rest of the year. Your second question was about performance there relative to the cost-plus business, we've get some good sized margins there. Yes, we're getting the benefits. Obviously, I think our cost-plus business in that arena is performing well as you would expect a typical cost-plus environment to perform. We are getting the benefit of the equity earnings, so we've get the income coming from ULA without the sales and that's the appropriate accounting for that, and that's helping boost those margins somewhat.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: Okay. And as a follow-up, can you just run through the timing on the big competition losses like competitions and the JLTV, what you're expecting there?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, let's talk about a couple of those. GPS 3 has been moving around a little bit here in the last few weeks, but I think the latest I have heard on that is that should happen probably sometime in the first early part of May and we are feeling good about that. And I think again the success we’ve had on the GPS 2R I think bodes well for that and I am optimistic there. JLTV is going to be a set demo probably the third quarter of this year, this is going to be the... I believe there are six teams competing this, it is going to go from six to three. I think there will be three individual awards, not overly large from a dollar perspective, but obviously strategically important to be in that [inaudible] to three. Later on in the fourth quarter, satellite wise, we have the GOES-R satellite, which is the weather satellite [inaudible] and that's probably just from the larger ones from a satellite perspective coming up.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: And TSAT, any update there?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: TSAT is still moving is the short answer there, and I'm not sure if that honestly stays in this year or not, I think that's to be determined yet still.
David E. Strauss - UBS Securities: Thanks a lot.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Operator: We’ll go next to Myles Walton with Oppenheimer.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks, good morning. Question on the C-130. At what point do you consider increasing the production rate there as opposed to stretching out the delivery horizon with the closure of the pending supplemental, I think you remind us how many are in there. Would the closure of that put up a pressure on the production rates as early as '09 or would that be a little further out? And just kind of if can you give some perspective on where you think those rates could go over the next couple of the years?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, well let's just say, we're not worried about having to stretch out the C-130 line, because we think there is a pretty hard market for C-130 aircraft. To your other point, I think there is a possibility we are going to see increasing production rates on the C-130 lines in Georgia in the not too distant future. I think obviously that's dependent upon a number of orders happening here in the near term that we are hopeful for, but I would not be surprised to see production rates of the C-130 production line increase in the 2010 time frame to some level higher than where we are today and we will probably have to gradually build to that over time, but it wouldn't surprised me at some point 2010, 2011 we are going to double the rate that we're today.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. That's really helpful. And maybe on the pull down of debt in the quarter, I think this was the first time you’ve done a net pull down of debt sort of for quite some time. Obviously, you’ve got a good rate on it, but the cash interest rate is obviously not a great trade at the moment. So, I guess can you give us a little bit of rationale there as to why pull it down now? And also I guess is the deployment of capital, given the cash and the balance sheet returns, now significantly lower than it was? Are you getting more attuned to M&A at all or should we just expect it to be more share repurchase?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good questions, Myles. Let's talk about the debt first. We did do the $1.5 billion in the first quarter. You kind of put yourself in the frame of mind of what we're looking at that time. It was a very opportunistic play, I think, on our part. We have... I think we have $100 million of debt coming up this quarter and we have about $1 billion convertible obviously in the August time frame. So, this was really a matter of maintaining our flexibility going forward. It was not any kind of things for any particular reason, it’s surely not any large acquisitions or the like. So, I don't… I wouldn’t read more into that and otherwise that we intended there. On the M&A front, I do believe we're seeing better prospects than we have in the recent past. I am hopeful we’ll see some of those close in. And I think looking forward back to the question that Rob asked early on about share repurchases versus M&A, I'm optimistic we can have some M&A activity come to fruition in the not too distant future. And I would do… let’s talk a little bit about the acquisition candidates there. I think several ones described their acquisition practices, building on a string of pearls and the like. I think that’s a pretty good analogy and I still see us as we go up forward, the ones we are looking at are probably $0.5 billion less kind of bolt-on niche acquisitions that give us some access to either some technology we didn't previously have, customer intimacy, customer access, those sorts of things. So, what we're planning to doing is probably no different than we’ve done in the past, but there could be a greater volume of those coming up in the not too distant future.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co.: All right. That's really helpful. Thanks, Bruce.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Operator: We’ll go next to Ron Epstein with Merrill Lynch.
Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning guys.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Ron. How are you?
Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Good. Secretary Young was out saying, I guess earlier maybe last week about the F-22 that he thought maybe upgrading the existing airplanes and that was just planned to be built is a better idea than extending the production. Do you guys have any thought on where the F-22 program is going to beyond 183?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, the first thoughts, we've got a… we are currently on a contract for a multi-year contract and that builds up to the 2011 time frame. I believe the supplemental budget leasing talked about right now adds four aircraft to the mix. So, that pushes us out, I think, about some time in the early 2012 time frame. That's a decision that needs to be made… as supplemental budget decision needs to be made in the latter part of this year. My view is, I mean you are not going to get a cheaper aircraft. I think Bob spoke [inaudible] last time we talked about the merits of the F-22 program, which are never going to hit as a program as the production curve cycle that is right now in terms of hitting on all cylinders from a volume perspective, from a low-cost perspective. Then you are right today. So, I think the actions that we are seeing right now is a little of bit of pushing that decision off next year and likely pushing it off to the next administration. So, I think we are doing everything we can do on our part to control that outcome and we’ll wait and see what happens.
Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Great. And then I guess as a follow-on to that. Can you give us an update on the international sales campaigns for F-35 and potentially the C-130 and any other aircraft program?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, sure. I'll start first with F-35. I think we are seeing some progress there in fact, but couple of the countries have at least informally, if not, formally notified their various parliaments’ legislations and so forth about the need to buy some accelerated flight test aircraft, in particular I think we are talking Netherlands and UK there. So, I think the prospects are at least as strong as they were previously, if not stronger to have some pull to the left from our international community. It helps, I believe, quite significantly with the dollar in the situation it is right now, to have the benefits from selling in US dollars. We've also got renewed interest. I think you've seen probably on the F-35 from both Israel and Japan, we've had some fairly recent meetings with both parties there that I think expressed some interest that we are hopeful consummates into a deal, that maybe as quickly as anybody that’s going to buy the aircraft from an international perspective in the marketplace. So, I think those are all on the other side of news. On the C-130Js, we still see or we just closed on the Indian deal here recently. I think there is a potential international order that we're going to get in the second quarter that maybe better the Blue Bird for us that I… I will talk about the names that we get there. But I'm optimistic we can sell four or so in a quarter that maybe a little quicker than we've previously expected there. I won’t limit it to just the C-130J, you didn't ask about F-16s. So, I think we're going to sign the Moroccan F-16 deal in the second quarter, probably as well for 24 aircraft. So, I think the international marketplace is looking very good for us right now across all the products there.
Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Operator: And we'll go next to Steve Binder with Bear Stearns.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: Yes, Bruce. Just a follow-on on F-16. Is Taiwan looking unlikely this year, do you think before the change in administration?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Again, Steve, that's about England’s call right now. I think the Taiwanese... I think with the recent change in administration, I think that's a favorable position compared to the old administration in Taiwan, I'm talking that in the US. So, I mean the platform that that particular party read on include the additional need for additional F-16s. I think there is a more positive outlook with that administration than what we had with the previous Taiwanese administration. So, I think those signals are both positive, whether gets done or not is a bit of a call. I think... I think the actions were in place to align for that to happen. Whether they happen or not is again kind of tough to call at this point.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: And as far as the language, did you say in your opening remarks first flight of the carrier variant being late ’08 or early ’09, is that correct?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I said we're going to roll out the first carrier variant aircraft in 2009.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: Because it's consistent with your language in the case still, which is some time in '09 first flight?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's correct.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: All right. And then also on cash flow, I know you touched a little bit on the receivables this year and international receipts. I'm just wondering, were there any collection issues domestically with any of your customers in the quarter?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, I mean I’ve looked at that, Steve. I mean we had just... I can tell you a story about this. We had a large payment that literally paid the Monday after accounting closed. I mean those are the type of things that just try to encourage when your poor results and you saw increases like that. I don't think there is anything to it that's systematic or systemic. It was just a timing issue.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: And one other thing on acquisitions. Are you kind of communicating kind of the level of activity greater than we achieved in '06, which is a little over $1 billion in cash out the door?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I don't see it quite at that level now.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: Okay. Thanks very much.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: And we'll go next to Carta Copeland [ph] with Lehman Brothers.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, hi guys.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, how are you?
Unidentified Analyst: Good. Just real quick on IS&GS and the revenue growth. I wondered if you might provide a little color on the moving pieces there and just characterize the three sub-segments relative to the 17% for the group as a whole?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Happy to do that. First off, I think all three LOBs within IS&GS and they were talking Information Systems, Global Services, and Mission Solutions, all three of them grew fairly significantly. It was not a slack or amongst the bunch there. So, good strong growth across all of them, probably led by the Mission Solutions and Global Services more so than the Information Systems piece as I looked at it. And the margin improvement that we saw, the operating EBIT we saw from that LOB was pretty much widespread there as well. So, good strong performance across all three LOBs within IS&GS.
Unidentified Analyst: But who would have... which piece would have been above and below the average in terms of... so it sounds like Mission Solutions and IS was ahead and Global was behind?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: From an absolute growth perspective, the largest growing LOB was actually the Global Services, I was looking more at the dollars there. But the actual growth rates for the highest in Global Services, and I'll say Mission System... Mission Solutions and Information Systems were about on par with the growth or slightly less than the overall 17% growth rate, which is still very healthy. All of them... every single one of them was the double-digit growth.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the color. And just a follow-on, you hit on this briefly with Myles, but with respect to the changes you made in the cash interest assumption that are sort of buried in the non-operating income guidance. I mean that looked pretty substantial and offset a good busy upside you had elsewhere.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Unidentified Analyst: But when you think about how this may continue to apply for the full year and how that could still change below the line. With respect to the convert, you mentioned that’s callable in Q3, am I correct in assuming that the interest impact is negligible should you choose to call those bonds, meaning since the assumed cash interest rate is now roughly equal to convert rate?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: [inaudible]. We do have the convertible is due in August, it's about... it’s a $1 billion fixed amount.
Unidentified Analyst: But should you choose to call it, there is no... that's encompassed in the guidance now.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There is no impact, those are the convertibles, the share impact there is already in our diluted shares. I mean I didn’t understand your question in the first place. But that's already reflected in our share count, so there will be no impact of that whatsoever on the overall diluted share count.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks Bruce.
Operator: We'll go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Thank you very much. I just want to go back to Aeronautics for a moment. Bruce, you talked about the F-22 making good progress and impact, I guess it's a little ahead of schedule. Yet when we look at the commentary, there doesn’t seem to be any discussed about improved profitability, you’re just being a little conservative or am I missing something?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, look I think we are in the seventh year of a 12-year program, Howard, and I think we are making great progress. But as I look at the milestones that we see on the F-35 program and what could kind of trigger an unexpected profit improvement. I don't see a lot of those happening in 2008 to be honest with you. I think we need to get some more of those behind us before I really... I’m comfortable with increasing that outlook there. I don't know if that's been conservative or not, Howard, but that's what we are.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company: You may have misheard me, I said the F-22 and then you made the F-35 comment.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You said F-22, but maybe I'm confused. I thought you were talking F-35. I read that into your line. You are talking F-22?
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Yes.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Let me view back on F-22. F-22, I'm sorry. F-22 had an outstanding quarter for the year. If you recall we had a number of adjustments at the end of the last year all throughout the year into 2007 as we retired a number of risk elements there. Last year we had the benefits of inception today, pick ups associated with those adjustments that absolute profit level is continuing into 2008 and as we go forward into 2008. If we continue on the trend we are now with continued success with zero defect aircraft and kind of manufacturing improvements that we are seeing, the levels of efficiencies. We may see something there, but I am not ready to comment to it at this point.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company: That's fair. Just sort of two things related to cash, one is it's pretty clear that it makes sense the force conversion of the... that $1 billion some. Is that sort of... are you sort of thinking about going forward to lower just absolute level of debt than you had in the past to just allow you to buy back more stock when you think about capital structure?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: A lower level of debt, I think… I mean that's a capital structure decision that we are going to make at that time, but we're comfortable with our capital structure as we speak. We'll make the decision on the convertible as the time approaches. Again, I made the comment earlier of talking about the debt. I like the flexibility we have right now. That’s a decision we'll make down the road, and we'll do that when it's appropriate.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company: And then you started the year with only $100 million in CapEx and I think you are targeting closer to $900 million or so, and I know the first quarter is always slow.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Is there anything there that's…
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, in fact first quarter was actually higher than the previous year's quarter. We are actually looking about $1 billion of CapEx and it doesn't surprise me whatsoever that we only spend $100 million in the first quarter.
Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Thank you very much.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You bet. Thanks, Howard.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Yes, thanks a lot. Bruce, I have to go back to space just to kind of dot the eyes a little bit and make sure I understood it. If I assume that $15 million process on ULA and normalize to that commercial satellite launch, the commercial satellite is about $125 million. It looks like structurally, if you do about the 12.3% margins that you reported on an ongoing basis, the question I don't think understand yet is how much was that terminated commercial launch contract and is the Orion ramp up diluted? Is that part of the reason why it seems like you're arguing that 1Q margins aren't sustainable going forward?
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I apologize if I was arguing, Heidi. I was not intending to, but…
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: No, no. I just made...
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: As I look at space, again I think what I am trying to tee up was that of the guidance increase we had at the end of the year, probably a third of that comes from that satellite adjustment and we talked about the termination, it's two-thirds as you relate, that will continue going forward. We are seeing growth in the CEV Orion program that is helping to minimize the increases going forward, and we won’t have that one-time Blue Bird in the first quarter. There is... I think actually you've got it pretty accurate.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: And then you've only got one commercial satellite left. So, in terms of zero margin, there is only another $125 million of headwinds. So if you can get performance, then arguably you could do better than where you are presently guiding for the rest regarding space. Is that fair?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think that that's probably fair.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: All right. Another question, can you give us some sense of what employee productivity measures that you monitor and what matters? When I look at the sales per employee trend, it's obviously been on the rise the last several years, from '01 to '07. But in 1Q ‘08, sales per employee turned down. Does that matter? Is that something we all in the outside should be watching?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. I got to be honest with you, Heidi. When I think to look at employee productivity, most of my metrics are in terms of the company, because I think the sales are going to take care of themselves, get out of the dip in Aeronautics. Internal measures, I look at... when we take a look at all these, they are different from kind of the manufacturing part of the business versus the technology side of the business, but we look at things like productivity measures in terms of well level of lines of code, are we programming in for a software, what levels of defects are we seeing in our software per expanded lines of code from a manufacturing side in the aircraft businesses. How many hours per unit, what sorts of efficiency levels, what sorts of realization rates are we experiencing there. So, there is nothing that I see in many of those metrics that gives any kind of cause for concern.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: All right. Great. And one last question, can you... you've obviously been a news quite a bit on some of the problem programs. Can you give us an update on some of the programs that are sort of broaching or currently in non-Mercury, you touched on VH-71 JASM, CIBERs [ph], any progress updates on those?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, let me see here. VH-71 JASM, what was the other one?
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: CIBERs [ph].
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: CIBERs [ph]. Let me start… let me start with JASM, I guess that's an interesting... an interesting program to begin with because all non-Mercurys are not created equal in the first place. I kind of like to characterize non-Mercurys between performance, non-Mercurys and administrative non-Mercurys and I would characterize the JASM non-Mercurys as administrative non-Mercurys. There is a more of technicality than anything else, but surely not performance on our part. So, I think that program is likely to get re-certified in the not too distant future and we're likely to get a new award for last seven missiles in the not too distant future. So I'm very optimistic about the outcome of JASM. The VH-71, we are currently still working the Increment I part of the solution set. There is going to be a decision, we need some funding... the FY '08 funding was a little short this year than what we would have like to have done. That caused a slip in the ILC date for those aircraft, the initial operating capability dates of those aircraft for 2010. There is a decision that’s been made as far as fully funding the Increment I solution in the latter part of this year. I'd look for that in the FY '09 budget and then there is a decision for the later on for the 23 production helicopters for VH-71 as far as how much of Increment II or I should say how large of Increment II are we going to do on those 23 aircraft. And that's a decision that's yet to be determined in my mind, it's likely to get pushed into the early next year as well. Let’s see, CIBERs [ph], I think CIBERs [ph], the last data I saw on that we're making progress on the flight service station software that was the issue that was raised there. And I think we're making good progress there to rectify that situation. I mean I look at all those programs, kind of all the high visibility programs that you talked about. I think that trend is going out for each and everyone of them. So, I am very pleased where we are headed.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great, Bruce. Thanks very much.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take a follow-up from George Shapiro with Citi.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Yes, Bruce. I was just looking at IS&GS after the 17% growth in the first quarter. If you're only going to get to the high end of your sales guidance for the year, the growth has really got to slow to around maybe 9% for the rest of the year. So, is there something that causes that to slow or it's just the first quarter was that much quicker or what happened or you just being conservative?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, again I think, I try to tee up 17% in the first quarter. I assume that although it's hard to figure out how much of that impact is due to the extra week. There was the extra week of all the business areas within the corporation, IS&GS is probably the one that’s affected by that. So, that had some impact there. As I look forward in the next three quarters, I think we're going to see fairly consistent growth and still getting to about the double-digit levels we talked about in the guidance. So, I don't think there is a cause for concern there.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Okay. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, George.
Operator: And we will take a follow-up from Joe Nadol with JP Morgan.
Joseph Nadol – JP Morgan: Yes, Bruce. Just back to Global Services. It sounds like the margins might have been down a couple of 100 basis points there. And I am wondering, was that PAE, was it somewhere out in... what was going on there?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I don't see the margins going down that dramatically in Global Services, we did have some high growth there. It wasn't as high as from a margin perspective as Information Systems or Mission Solutions. But I don't think there is a PAE issue there at all.
Joseph Nadol – JP Morgan: What was the driver, because you said that sales growth was better than 17% but operating profits remain unchanged. So what drove that?
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Again a lot of these contracts are, not to get into the accounting specifics. But this is service contract accounting and depending on the hiring of when those receipts come in quarterly numbers tends to balance around. But overall I don't see a change thus far we are discussing.
Joseph Nadol – JP Morgan: Okay. Thanks.
Bruce Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And with no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over for any additional or closing remarks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Thank you, Stacey. As we conclude, I would like to thank all of you for your continued interest in Lockheed Martin and for joining the call today. Our results demonstrate the progress we are achieving across the corporation and our portfolio of programs.

And looking at 2007, our overall program execution was solid, we won important new business, and we continue to shape a balanced business portfolio designed to enhance shareholder value while meeting current and future customer needs. Let me spend a moment on each of these areas. Program execution continues to be a top priority and focus for all of us. It's essential for customer mission success and it's essential to our ability to extend value. Our goal while challenging is to meet every commitment, on every program, for every customer by completing key milestones on time and on budget and providing continuously improving quality. The professional standards against which we measure ourselves here is perfection. And when we do not meet that standard and sometimes we don't, all energies are devoted to an objective understanding as to why, whatever the source and to addressing the root causes with effective remedial action. We believe we have the experience, the talent, and the commitment to assure continues improvement in meeting expectations. As a result, we had thousands of successful operational achievements across all business areas in 2007, I will highlight just a few. We made continued progress on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter development program with completion of 22 test flights of the conventional take off and landing aircrafts. In addition we achieved production roll out in December of the short take off and vertical landing variant with the Stovall airplane, reflecting on time achievements of a key commitment date. We are confident this 5th generation tactical combat aircraft will serve our country and our allies well for decades to come. Also in aeronautics the U.S. Air Force declared full operational capability for the F-22 Raptor, the world's only fielded 5th generation fighter aircraft. In electronic systems, we had a series of successful tests of THAAD, PAC-3 and the AEGIS missile defense program. I am certain that solid operational performance also acts as an important catalyst in our ability to win new business. Customers have confidence in our capabilities and that confidence enabled us to achieve the second highest annual level of new order bookings in the history of our company. This booking level resulted in a near record backlog at year-end of almost $77 billion. We believe this new business success is a result of effectively listening to our customers, a continuous drive for innovation and responsiveness, superior program execution, and our ability to leverage our experience and our skills through capabilities alignment and horizontal integration across this corporation. Examples of our new business success included the multi-year contract in the United States Air Force for 60 F-22 fighter aircraft to extend the production line to 2011. The first F-35 Joint Strike Fighter low rate initial production contract and long lead funding of the second, international C-130J awards from Canada and Norway that extend the production line to 2011, a 10 year $1 billion contract to train U.S. Air Force with special operation command crews on a variety of military and weapon system, international F-16 awards from Turkey and Pakistan that extend the production line to 2012, $1 billion multiyear contract from the United States Navy to integrate the MH-60 Romeo helicopter system, and $850 million contract from the U.S. Navy for production and support on the Trident II D5 fleet Ballistic Missile and civil information outsourcing contracts with the internal revenue service The FBI, The General Services Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers. In addition to solid performance and key new business awards, we continue to enhance our business portfolio through acquisitions. During 2007, we completed four transactions. These acquisitions have already provided strategic benefits in securing new technologies and providing expansion of our capabilities and new customer access. This brings our total completed transaction since 2001 to 19. We are confident that those that were closed in 2007 will provide the same positive value to shareholders that previous acquisitions provided. During 2007 we saw significant new opportunities emerge in the international marketplace in our traditional lines of business, such as fighter and transport aircraft and missile defense systems. We also made significant progress into new adjacent business activity such as logistics and sustainment, biometrics, business process solutions, and support for peacekeeping and nation building efforts. We also remain dedicated to fostering an inclusive workplace environment where opportunity exists for those with talent and commitment. It's very gratifying to receive recognitions, that Lockheed Martin is a desirable and valued place to work. We received more than one million resumes in 2007 and the Company was slated again by Business Week magazine as a great place to launch professional career. Additionally, the Hay Group in conjunction with CEO magazine and Hewitt Associates in conjunction with Fortune magazine recognized Lockheed Martin for outstanding leadership development programs. This is important to us because to have a business that builds upon the momentum that we have established raises the bar on performance and meets the expanding challenges our customers are facing, requires the very best in talent, and the very finest in leaders. Sustained long-term success depends upon it and we are committed to developing both as we continue make to progress on our strategy to differentiate Lockheed Martin among competitors, to diversify our business, and to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. Looking ahead to 2008 and as outlined in our increased guidance, we anticipate strong growth in our recurring earnings per share, continued growth in revenue and margin, and excellent cash generation. Let me describe for you our general sense of the overall market and our vision for the future as we look at 2008 and beyond. Long-term there are many signs of continuing complexity and uncertainty in the global security environment which will drive future demands for highly capable military power, strengthen home land security, and importantly further initiatives aimed at international outreach, diplomacy, humanitarian relief, and support for emerging democracies. We see a growing desire in civil government agencies to have more efficient and effective services provided to citizens. We see a growing international interest in security and how our capabilities, products, and services can play a vital role. To reduce uncertainty and gain clarity all our customers are facing the need for increased situational awareness through advanced sensing devices that will be linked to communication systems that enable them to share information and to be always connected. With data everywhere, networks will continue to grow an importance in power and unfortunately in their vulnerability as well as, the corruption of information will be increasingly viewed as a weapon in the 21st century. We have the experience, skills, and breadth in our portfolio to contribute significantly to the need in this environment. Looking at funding the current fiscal year 2008 defense budget was enacted at $481 billion reflecting a double-digit increase in annual funding. The investment account in this budget were funded at $176 billion also reflecting a double-digit annual increase. Additionally, supplemental appropriations of $189 billion have been requested to primarily fund the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with budget approval yet to be enacted. Looking forward the President's proposed 2009 fiscal year budget for defense will be delivered to the Congress in February. It's likely to be at least $513 billion which is consistent with the President's prior projection. Investment accounts here are projected to be about $188 billion also consistent with the earlier request. The FY09 supplemental appropriations request has had an initial place holder value of $50 billion. However, the administration is awaiting the next report from General Petraeus on progress in Iraq before determining the final amount for the FY09 supplemental appropriations. Based on all that we see, we expect continued growth in both our core and adjacent markets for both domestic and international customers. As, we grow we anticipate an increasingly diversified customer portfolio with increasing levels of international and civil government sale. We'll continue to expand our addressable government market in three ways by focusing on customers we know and utilizing capabilities we now possess, by extending value to our customers in offering new capabilities and by developing new customer relationships. Looking, specifically at our business areas we want our electronic systems business to grow domestic and international sales in areas such as missile defense with the Patriot and THAAD systems in missile and fire control systems on programs such as HELLFIRE the guided multiple launch rocket system, Sniper and THAAD in maritime systems such as Ejects [ph], and in platforms and training with system integration on helicopters and military vehicles. Growth also will come from continued creative approaches to adjacent markets and our focus here is on the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program. We want our information systems in global services business to continue their growth in government information technology, related to our traditional areas of defense, intelligence, and civil agencies and new focus areas such as healthcare. In our global services business focus will be placed on homeland security with solutions for port security and cargo tracking coupled with anticipated growth in infrastructure, peace keeping, and nation building activities. In our space business, we expect future revenues to be driven by the government satellite market in opportunities like GPS III, additional advanced VHF spacecrafts, POES and the GOES-R Environmental Satellite Systems. Our ramp up on the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and potential space exploration missions for NASA will also provide additional opportunities for revenue expansion. Looking at Aeronautics, as we previously indicated we expect sales growth to hit a low point in 2008 reflecting the reduction of F-16 deliveries. However sales growth resumption is expected in 2009, driven by the ramp up on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, continued C130J and F-22 production in increasing levels of sustainment and logistics activities. We will continue to pursue balanced cash deployment, returning at least half of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, while using remaining cash flow to pursue internal technology initiatives, capital projects and acquisitions that will add to productivity and expand our capabilities. In addition, we have a share repurchase authority in excess of $3 billion that will enable us to make opportunistic purchases to eliminate share creed and return cash to shareholders. Acquisitions will remain an important component of our strategy to built value in our portfolio and our philosophy on acquisitions remains unchanged. We would have an interest in companies with the right expertise, a good fit, and compelling value. As we continue to grow our sales organically and through acquisitions, we are also focused on ways to continue to expand our margin. We are pleased to report that we've already achieved one of the two goals that we outlined for you during our earnings call last January. In 2007, segment operating margins increased to 11.2%, achieving our goal of 100 basis point increase above 2006 level, ahead of our previously projected target date. We continue to see opportunities for additional margin expansion by successfully transitioning development programs to production, improving program performance, and adding higher margin international business. We are also accelerating our commitment to achieve the second goal. We now project achievement of our $5 billion in segment operating profits objective, one year earlier than previously forecast with a new target date of 2009. In addition through our continued focus on operating profit generation and margin expansion, we remain committed to strong cash generation and industry leading returns on invested capital. Our prior goal to sustain ROIC performance in the 15% to 20% range remains unchanged. We believe that the keys to our future success are very simple and straight forward, continuous development of critical competencies, attracting and retaining top employee talent, ensuring alignment of management shareholder interest, listening to our customers, driving innovation, leveraging horizontally integration, and deploying cash wisely. Dana, that concludes our brief summary of '07 and our outlook for 2008. So, if you will open the lines please, Bruce and Jerry and myself are ready to take questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions]. We will first go to Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Good morning Bob. Thanks very much for your brief. That was great. I'm going to ask though a devils advocate question for you. You continue to take in a number of noteworthy wins the last few years, again in 2007 but we have also been seeing a number problem program surfacing, I'm wondering if you could talk about the corrective actions you're taking within your organization. I know you referred to the personnel but perhaps talk about tease and fees on the contract and are there are any common threads that you see that might link things like cibers [ph] and JAS [ph] and then LCS and VH-76 that could be important lessons learned and which problem programs are you spending the bulk of your time on?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Heidi, I appreciate the question. I must tell you, we spend a considerable amount of our time and attention on all of the 3,000 programs. We don't really select them on which programs and which customers are going to get the best professional performance in the company. We pay attention to all program performance but I do know what you're speaking of in your question. There are some high visibility, marked key programs that we are all very familiar with. You might add to that list the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter or the Littoral Combat Ship. You mentioned cibers [ph]; I'm pleased to report than in the company with more than 3,000 programs, we don't have a great number of these high visibility programs. I'm also recognizing that even having even one of those programs is one too many. It's interesting to me that, when as your question frame, you look at what might be common properties here. Our observation is that most of the difficulties in execution on a program seem to reside in those that fall into the development portfolio as compared to the production portfolio. And development program have characteristics in common, among them is assuring that even in the very early stages of the programs formulation that the requirements are well understood, that customers know what they want to buy, and that industry understands completely what it needs to deliver, not just what the contract terms and conditions are, but what the customer's expectation is, particularly aligning the system that's being delivered to the concept of operations in which it will be employed. And I think one of the common themes as we look at our portfolio, as to where there have been stress points, is this common notion of the developmental character of the system. I will also tell you a second independent area, but it's entirely unrelated to development is this aspirational goal that many have had, about the use of non-developmental items or commercially available off the shelf items, that would be applied to, let me say, very sophisticated military or intelligence gathering applications. Because it seems to me that there is a desire, a very understandable desire, to want field systems more quickly and want to more economically use scarce capital resources in the acquisition environment. And that makes non-developmental or commercial... commercially available items appear very appealing. But sometimes after the contract is led, a view is taken of the capabilities embedded in these systems with the desire to add some facility to them and we find some stress points associated with having a clear understanding there of what's expected and how to efficiently take non-development items and commercially available products and cater to them appropriately for the demands and the rigors of very demanding military applications. I will tell you, we are strongest, when we go back to basics. When we follow the processes in our environment, when we have early visibility, when we have complete transparency and when we work in close co-operation and good partnership with our customers. When our programs have those features, even the very demanding ones, we tend to perform in a more superior way and when those features are lacking, we tend to have stress points.
Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great and Bob as my follow-up, you've spoken about making Lockheed a global security company, you talked today about expanding international sales. Looking ahead, can you give us a sense where international sales can go in '08 and through the rest of the decade and maybe outline the major competitions internationally that moved the needle and how you are focusing your team to fully capitalize on those international opportunities and maybe Bruce if you have it handy, tell us where international sales were in '07?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Let me come back to Bruce and I will just give you sort of cap stone, sense of what we see and where we would like to make some advances, and of course our commitment here is to grow our international business along with our entire business, but to grow the proportion of revenue generated from international sales from about 14% or so to about 20% or so and we would like to do that as soon as possible. I think our aeronautics lines of business continue to offer real opportunities here with the Joint Strike Fighter, I know it's in development but we do have eight partner countries and so far there is considerable international interest here and happily, I can report to you that the program is meeting critical milestones, and running pretty well. We continue to see a broad interest in the C-130J program internationally. I mentioned Norway and Canada as recent customers. But there certainly additional opportunities in our judgment with the increasing number of countries some of whom already have the C-130J and for some the C-130J would be new. So we're looking forward there and I don't think the F-16 story is over yet, although, as you look at aeronautics revenue, you see the number of airplanes in the F-16 delivery line coming down, there's still interest in that system. We have a full array of missile defense capabilities. As protecting a homeland or protecting troops that are forward deployed, it's a very high priority for governments. I think we have a superb portfolio in Patriot, MEADS, THAAD, the AEGIS system, that add real muscularity to a missile defense environment. I also think in our missiles and fire control segment, we have quite a broad variety of military capabilities, that governments have interest in, including sniper, Lantran [ph] and THAAD. I mentioned the guide of Multiple Launch Rocket System, HELLFIRE, ATACMS [ph]. We have radar programs from our electronics systems business area. In the United Kingdom, there will be a search and rescue helicopter program, in the United Kingdom there will be a census program, so I do not feel that we have a shortage of opportunities internationally. Actually, I think the domestic opportunity horizon looks very good. But your question was specifically on international business and I'll ask Bruce to comment on the '07 international sale.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Heidi we did just over about $6 billion for the year ending in 2007, but roughly 15% of sales.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Binder with Bear Stearns.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: Yeah, Bob. If you can just touch on the F-22, there has been talk in the FY09 budget, given the fact you are hoping to get advance procurement money for another twenty planes, it looks like they might just fund four planes. But they are going to do that as a supplemental. Assuming that's true, what's the prospects for, do you think, extending the line -- from getting money from Congress this year in the core budget, and how important an issue is it to get money out of the core budget as opposed to the supplemental for that plane.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'll tell you Steve, our focus has, I think, understandably and properly been on delivering very high quality jets and we are certainly doing that. It's of interest to us that we're starting to see the harder facts of what is generally regarded as an ageing fleet with high operational tempo. And we certainly saw that in the pair of F-15 failures and we don't find that to be entirely unique because it's embedded in the phenomenology of how airplanes age and fail. So, our sense is, the operational tempo is not likely to diminish in the foreseeable future. The assets that are fielded are getting older and they are starting to move into the higher regions of their expected service life. And we've worked long and hard in conjunction with our customers to get the F-22 line, to balance and cycle and get the supply chain to run effectively and efficiently and I assure you it is. And a person like me looks at shutting down a line that has taken a good deal of time to bring to this configuration with real reluctance because there will never be a less expensive F-22 than the ones we can buy off an active line that's meeting its learning curve objectives with incredibly high quality, incredibly high performance jet. And I think the convergence of the ageing F-15, the demands in the operational tempo, the evolutional of the trust, and the quality of this line are creating a fairly compelling dialogue that's occurring in the Pentagon and on Capital Hill. I know you know there is not a perfect uniformity abuse here but we think it's a very healthy dialogue. Whether or not the program is extended is certainly not a decision that we make and whether or not it is funded out of supplemental appropriations or out of core budget appropriations is a decision others will make. Our job is to make sure that, that option remains open and that the jets that would be purchased would be performing to expectation. So, I guess our sense is this prospect is looking more likely rather than less likely for the conditions I outlined.
Steve Binder - Bear Stearns: Thank you. And can you maybe just touch on the F-35 and your confidence level of achieving first flight in the major timeframe.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, that's certainly is the plan we are tracking to. We made the roll out on schedule on the STOVL aircraft in December. That was a long standing commitment, that was actually reinforced very strongly by Deputy Secretary of Defense, Gordon, England with us as an expectations that he had and we took that expectation seriously and we were able through the very good work of our Aeronautics team and our partners, to produce and deliver the airplane on time. So, we are tracking there and of course AA1 is flying and we are gaining a lot of flight information on the first airplane, the conventional take-off version. So, so far that objective looks achievable, Steve.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Troy Lahr of Stifel Nicolaus.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Backlog was up pretty nicely in 2007. Can you just comment a little bit on what you are thinking for 2008 backlog, does it kind of level off or do you think it continues to grow next year?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Troy, this is Bruce. I'll take that one. We did have a good close to the end of the year 2007 backlog. I think in the third quarter that I had keyed up the notion that we might end up about $75 billion or so. We actually ended up just under $77 billion. Most of that came with the benefits of getting the Canadian order late in the year. And we also had strong -- every one of the business areas was up in backlog in the fourth quarter, lot of good awards there. As we go forward into 2008, I expect to have a similar level, maybe a little bit higher than where we ended the year 2007. There are some really good, big sized opportunities in 2008, the TSAT contract, GPS III. We have got a DOE Hanford award that's potentially out there, despite a few, a lot space related, quite honestly. So, our CGX radar and the electronics system business area and we are still taking international opportunities of aircrafts, as I said earlier.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then just as a follow up, how are you seeing spending right now in the classified market. It seems like some companies are saying it's really slowed down, others are saying they are starting to see recovery. So, it seems kind of all over the map.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: I'm trying to decide how to answer that, Troy. I am not sure I want to comment on the level of classified business up or down, to be honest with you.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus: So just directionally though I mean you are not really seeing any change in the level of spending that you guys are seeing?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: I don't see -- if you are concerned about a large drop up, I don't see that happening now.
Troy J. Lahr - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Alright. Thanks guys.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Yeah.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.
.:
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Good afternoon, everyone.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Bob, just thinking about your comment on $5 billion in profits as a hurdle in '09 that you will achieve or likely achieve. Yes, when I look at the numbers there is sort of this cross-up between sales growth and margin expansion, seems to me you could do even well better than that, so in that vein, how do you look from a longer term three years and out prospective at sales growth and margin expansion targets?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'd say carefully and with good constructs here but generally I think we have been as careful and as transparent as we are able to be let's start with sales growth. By looking at our four principal business areas, their book-to-bill, our backlog, and opportunity horizon, our likely capacity to go out and win in a highly competitive marketplace, we hold that into projections. It is that kind of process that led us to offer you a projections sometime ago that indicated in our judgment after coming off, say mid single-digit annual revenue growth that we would have a deceleration in that growth in 2008. We are experiencing about that deceleration that we thought we would see with an expectation that we would recover that top-line growth in the 2009 timeframe and that... we would return after about relatively flat spot to about mid single-digit top-line. That's the very best indication we have by looking at our core business and our adjacencies, our backlog, and our opportunities. From that revenue forecast and that opportunity horizon, we then do as comprehensive a level of modeling we can as to what our earnings expectation and cash flow generation ought to be if we are able to continue to improve our operational processes here and cross pollinate the best practices from one part of the company to another to assure continuous improvement which means continuous expansion of margins, additions in absolute dollar value to earnings, expanding our returns on invested capital. We have been applying that model now for years. So, I would submit to you we got a track record that you can certainly look out and judge for yourself as to whether it is as effective as you think it could be. We certainly look at it that way and ask is it as effective as it can be then how do we approve it and that's sort of the summary level, the composite view of how we approach these goals and objectives.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: I guess, what I am getting at Bob is it seems your long-term growth could be more driven at least in our model by sales growth than margin expansion but is that incorrect?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't think it is incorrect. I am sorry if I conveyed that to you incorrectly. We certainly believe consistently with your view that we have sales growth opportunities that ought to contribute to profitability but that isn't to say we are finding ourselves without good conviction that we can look at further margin expansion and here again that margin expansion is not independent of sales growth, we think international business gives us margin expansion opportunities. We think the transition of programs from their developmental environment which as Heidi's questioned reflected some stress points, some stress points reflect award fees that maybe a little suppressed but when we get to production we are able realize further margins because those programs stand to perform pretty well. So, I think we have both sides of that revenue growth and margin expansion.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Thanks Bob. And just quickly Bruce, could you refresh us on the unit numbers for the major aerospace, aeronautics programs in '08.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Sure in terms of number of deliveries.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Yes F-22, C-130, F-16.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Think of F-16 as somewhere and currently above the high 28 range, F-22 is probably a little lower than what we were at the end of 2007 maybe 20 to 21 and C-130 again we are just at about one a month so I think of that as about 12 in 2008.
Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities: Fantastic. Thanks, guys.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Yes.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: You are welcome. Thanks.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Robert Stallard with Banc of America.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Good afternoon.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, good afternoon Robert.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Bob I thought I will first tackle the situation of the U.S. economy with the obvious slowdown in economic growth. Do you think there could be any risk to some of your State and local service activity as you move through 2008?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Robert, not that we see. Believe me, as you would expect given the, I guess there is no shortage of information about speculation as to what the economies are looking like. We've taken that into full consideration and don't envision any Robert.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Okay and as a follow-up. You mentioned JLTV is one of the adjacent market programs that you are pursuing, it seems you require a lot of other teams in the hunt as well. What would you say is Lockheed Martin's biggest pitch to the military if they consider these different teams?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think we have got an excellent pedigree in systems integration. So, it depends on, if you want to buy a truck or you want to buy a much more refined system that really brings information into each crew vehicle, we have unique and I don't want to describe this anymore fully than this we have some unique approaches we believe to protecting that crew and we look forward to this competition because I think it gives us an opportunity to showcase some really dazzlingly interesting and innovative technology in a full systems configuration and I am confident that we'll put forward a very, very persuasive atmosphere.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: When you are expecting news on this program in terms of drill downs or things like that?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: I think, Bob this is Bruce, I think there is planning right now. There is perhaps a tech demo in the second quarter, perhaps a little a later this year.
Robert Stallard - Banc of America Securities: Yes.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: And our judgment here is that, at one time, I guess there was a conceptualization that the program might proceed without technology demonstration segment. And I think there has been a more emerging discussion now, about having technology demonstrators and maybe opening the aperture and bringing in, down selecting, but not down selecting to one but bringing in two or three companies, to bring a more diversified view of the technology. So, the road tests, those concepts in vehicles, and then have a second down select after that.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Myles Walton with Oppenheimer & Company.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co: Thanks, good afternoon.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co: Another follow-up on the international sales if I could. Bruce what was the percent or dollar value of the international bookings in '07?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: I'm not sure, I have got that number off of the top of my head Myles to be honest with you.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co: Okay. The reason I asked, I am just curious, we've see a lot the interest side through the foreign military sale notifications and I guess Bob maybe this is a question for you, given the rollover in administration, do you think a lot of those negotiations will be somewhat fast track, to ensure that you get it in under the kind of current bodies that are in the policy making seats?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I guess our view is that the rhythm is just going to continue the pace, I'm not sure we are going to see a wholesale or significant acceleration.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co: Okay. Then maybe... ask one other, on the adjacent markets that you mentioned healthcare and energy, Bob can you cite kind of how large those are today and maybe in a five year plan, what your penetration rate could be in such markets?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I give you a sort of a rounded feel of it. Now say for example, in healthcare information technology for our company today, it's a relatively small market segment. But as one of the acquisitions that we highlighted was a company called Management Systems Designers who have not only expertise in developing healthcare information systems but have an installed base so they have introduced us to a new customer set like the National Institutes of Health and what we attempt to do is build that market from there. So I would tell you quite candidly, it will start small and we will be deliberate and careful here. But when we look at areas that are in need of improved performance, particularly improved performance that can be brought about by bringing either systems integration, software development, or business process improvement skills, we have a very compelling portfolio in each of those areas that have been applied to national imperatives and civil government agencies previously and we believe, we can help address the rising cost of healthcare and the general dysfunctionalility of the distribution of healthcare information through superior information technology products. So that's something we are going to have to work on and build from the inside out.
Myles Walton - Oppenheimer & Co: Alright, great. Thanks
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Joe Nadol of JP Morgan.
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan: Thanks, good afternoon.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Joe.
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan: So Bob I would like to get back to the F-35 a little bit, you shared one major milestone with us this coming year, which is the installed first flight [ph] and I am wondering, if you could maybe go into a little more detail on what some of the others are. I think clearly last year, you made some nice progress on the program but you had a 7 month period of time, where you didn't fly the plane, the conventional plane and it seems to me that this year is really important one to make a lot of progress on milestones given the sort of the importance the program has to sales growth in nine and ten.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: You are absolutely right Joe, Bruce has the detailed. I will let Bruce to comment.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Joe as we look at '08 being the significant event or significant milestones, that I'm watching at least. But again Bob mentioned the rollout of the version in December of last year. We talked about first flight of that particular vehicle in the second quarter of this year. We've actually got the roll out of the carrier variant, that's the navy aircraft to the Joint Strike Fighter program and the fourth quarter of 2008. And we're going to be conducting throughout the year a number of flights on the two aircrafts that'll be flying, both the, the current one the AA1 as we call it, which is the conventional takeoff aircraft, as well as the STOVL once its up and flying. And we'll also be doing, risk reduction with the so called CATBird or avionics test bed and that's where we have the systems integration capability, kind of packed into a commercial airliner and modified to simulate that which is flying on the F-35 aircraft itself. So there is some early risk reduction associated with that, there are a lot of flights in '08 there as well and the last piece of this, we'll continue to build the other 16 aircrafts in the STD program.
Joseph B. Nadol III - JP Morgan: Okay, I'm wondering if you could share... that's great, thanks for all that information, I'm wondering, if you could share more qualitatively, that where may Bob, where you think you are? If the problems that you encountered last year are fully resolved, did you still have some questions in your mind on any particular aspects of why the aircraft was grounded, and weight issues, what is foremost on your mind with regard to the development program right now?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think the development program is getting much more mature. We're learning more as we go... the aircraft was down for while due to some engine performance issues. We have understood those engine issues, our partners have gotten on that problem right away. Every time you ring the problem, I like that out of the system, you gain a huge amount of information. Its very gratifying Joe in the 22 flight tests that we have conducted on the conventional take offs, airplane its performance, its characteristics, its handling is up and away. The basic fundamental engineering flight dynamics, overall performance are meeting or exceeding those targets, if you were internal to an airplane company, you would learn part of the vocabulary called Code-1 and Code-1 is a statement indicating when an airplane lands, it just needs gas and it's ready to go again. It is exceedingly rare to have the first flying article to land anywhere near Code-1 and the AA-1C aircraft lands Code-1 with some frequency. We are confident in, while our airplane is undergoing test. The engine builders are also testing their configurations. So we have confidence that the lift span is going to perform, that all the mechanics there are going to provide the appropriate and associated amount of thrust. So I would tell you the way we look at it is, how much risk reduction are we experiencing, versus risk that we had forecast as a function of time and as a function of dollars. And I think that we are on or even a little ahead of the overall risk reduction. You can't really predict if the engine is going to eat a blade, you just can't have that knowledge. But you lay into your programs schedule and you lay into your concepts of development, the prospect that something is going to happen, we call them unknown, unknowns which is such an inelegant phrase but that's what it is. We are making performance milestones on this jet burning off points on the fly test cards in a fashion that we had expected and the repository of knowledge, we've about the flight characteristics of the airplane is superb. And I would also go back and just underscore the comment Bruce offered about this CATBird, almost always on airplane programs, you develop these pieces in sequence and it makes perfect sense because you don't have an airplane against which you tested flying characteristics. So obviously you don't have an airplane into which to install avionics, to test them when it flies, you have to wait till you get there. The CATBird enabled us to run parallel pads and those parallel pads really do reduce the schedule risk, because as we are gaining flight dynamic information on AA-1 airplane we are gaining a lot of system integration knowledge, about putting all the avionics together. So we will have at that main point a much more robust avionics suite to put into a much more robust flying article. Operator: And we will take our next question from David Gremmels of Thomas Weisel Partners.
David Gremmels - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks. Good morning... good afternoon.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, David how are you?
David Gremmels - Thomas Weisel Partners: Good thanks. Bob you touched on margin expansion opportunities, in your prepared remarks. And I would like to ask about, aeronautics profitability. The guidance implies high 11% operating margin in aero, which of course would be down from '07 and I guess we are getting used to only thing that numbers go up. So have you hit a feeling in aero or if not what could happen to move the margin higher from here?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: David, if I could jump in, this is Bruce. Let me try and address that for you. We experienced within aeronautics particularly second half of '07 continuing what Bob talked about the JASF program and risk retirement. So, we got the same sort of characteristics in our production programs, risk retirements for things such as offset obligations, I mean within the F-16 line, we actually moved that line at the end of 2006, there was clearly some risk associated with doing that. As those sorts of risks were retired and we start to see some production efficiencies again particularly, in the second half of '07 we released some of the reserve, we did some pick up associated with that, and that's why you saw the strong performance in '07 for both of those events. That has the effect of the inception to-date pick-up and that's why we had margins in excess of 12% in both those quarters. That good performance, that good momentum is carrying over into 2007, we did actually increase if you take the mid-point margins from '07 to '08, we actually did increase that. That's a direct reflection of that kind of performance that we had in 2007 carrying over into 2008. We just don't get that inception to date benefit. As we go through 2008, we got the same sorts of risk retirement profiles and hopefully some prediction -- some production efficiencies that we'll see if we can do better on.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: And David, I'll add, a couple of degrees are free to remove from the immediate fee of margin expansion. We have talked among ourselves in conversations like this quite a bit about what environmental conditions or circumstances have to exists, for the customer to get good value for the money that he spent and for us to be able to return good value to shareholders. You are seeing the manifestation of some of those issues actually converge in our aeronautics business right now. Because we talked about, do we have good command of the requirements on the airplane. Well, that's true on the F-16, that's true on the C-130, that's true on the F-22. Is there funding stability for the program. While we have a multi-year now on the F-22 and we have a multi-year on the C-130J. If you have funding stability and requirement stability then it's the contractor's responsibility to get a line of balance that works to drive that through the supply chain, to optimize, to make the right investments, to put the right labor on, to get the right training, to put the right process in place. So, if some of the parts model, it's real easy to say and it's very difficult in reality to accomplish. And in our aeronautics business we think that sum of all of these parts and the convergence of all of these prior initiatives on the part of our customer, on the part of our own workforce, on the part of our suppliers and our partners have lead to an environment where we're really optimizing the performance here. The result is that customers getting very high quality airplanes that have no defects upon their delivery, all the parts work, all the systems work, that degree of customer satisfaction clearly goes up. And as their interests are satisfied, our ability to return to investors as you would expect goes up. And it's that virtual cycle that we've all work so hard to achieve. And that's why when there is a question about the F-22 or any other question about, do you want to discontinue the production line, I think a lot of careful consideration ought to be given about such discontinuity because it's real hard to get and it's real easy to give up, and you don't get it back.
David Gremmels - Thomas Weisel Partners: That's great. And if I could just ask a quick one on cash flow, you had a great year even after the $0.5 billion pension contribution. Just wondering how much pension contribution, if any is contemplated in your '08 cash flow guidance?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well not, not any now. I mean we'll always take a look at it, there is no contemplation there.
David Gremmels - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks very much.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: You bet. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.
Douglas Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Good afternoon.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Doug.
Douglas Harned - Sanford Bernstein: On space, when we look out to next year, your guidance is, I would say flat at best in terms of revenues and I know you commented in the earnings release that satellites were down some in Q4. How do you see, first, could you comment on what brought this satellites down in Q4 and then how do you see that mix between the three businesses going into 2008?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Let me make sure I'm clear on the three businesses?
Douglas Harned - Sanford Bernstein: I am thinking of S&DMS, Space Transportation, Satellites.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we are looking forward to opportunities in government satellites this year of a pretty significant number and dollar value, particularly when you think of the global positioning three contract, here you should probably think above $1 billion class award, perhaps awarded in the second quarter. I think we have a competitive offering there. There will be an environmental satellite called GOES or here the customer is NASA that will likely be awarded later in the year. Perhaps in the third to fourth quarter and I think may be think about it in hundreds of millions of dollar, class of opportunity and then there is a transformational communication system, TSAT. There is some discussion as to whether TSAT will be reformulated or not but as of now we are competing with an offering for that satellite system.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Doug, if I could jump in. Let me talk a little about the variability, you are talking the satellite changes. We are seeing -- we are going from four commercial sats in 2007 down to two commercial sats in 2008. So, as you would expect our satellite line of business is going to be down somewhat because of those reductions. On the other hand within space transportation, we actually are going to see some good side stroke there that potentially is going to mitigate being down the two commercial satellites. That's really coming from the CEB or Orion program and then we have got on the straight defensive missile, the fleet lines, a little bit of growth but still fairly flat up. Also, the three of those, sats is down a little bit, space transportation offsetting that and strategic and defensive missile is really flat as well.
Douglas Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Okay then separately on aeronautics, do you talk about what you are seeing in terms percentage of sustainment revenues today and if you see that moving higher as you go into '08 and '09 and would that have a positive impact on margin potentially?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: I'll try to address that as well. I think sustainment revenue, and one of the reasons... we keyed up for quite some time the fact that we thought aeronautics was going to be down about $1 billion year-over-year from 2007 to 2008. I tweaked the guidance just a tad on aero going into 2008. So, its somewhat less than $1 billion. That's almost entirely because of additional sustainment prospects within the combat airplane F-16 and F-22 as we start to position more and more F-22s at their various bases where they're going to be located within the country of United States. We are seeing the sustainment business there growing higher than what we'd anticipated when I gave you the October guidance. As far as margin is concerned, I'm not sure, that line of business for us within aeronautics is probably equal to the overall margins of the business. So, it will probably bring with it a similar level of margin going forward.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Could you tell us what are you assuming for tax rate for the year and what is the impact since your now not assuming the R&D tax credit. If it's enacted, what impact that will have on your tax rate?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Hey Cai, thanks. I think I'm tax guy today, so, I will try to answer that. I would think for a guidance purposes, our tax rates in 2008 is just a little below 33% and we did have the... back in the October guidance, we did have the assumption that the R&D tax credit would be passed and its been passed every year for a number of years. That was actually linked with the alternative minimum tax build end of the year in December, those got separated, the AMT, they get passed, the R&D tax credit did not. The effects of that on our overall tax rate was about 70 basis points.
Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company: Okay. Excellent. That's all I had. Thanks.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Thanks, Cai.
Operator: And we will go next to Howard Rubel of Jefferies & Co.
Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: Well, thank you. I have one question for Bob and -- we all expect for the out of the rockets at some point but you talked to a lot of people that operate in that world and one of your predecessors had a charge to show that overtime the product should produce should be just one missile, one airplane and so on. And, so one of the risks you always have Bob is, how do you make things more affordable and what have you seen that Lockheed can bring to bear to solve this, this new war that we seem to be fighting?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I will certainly say, Howard if there is one missile and one airplane, I hope we are the people who are making it. We work very aggressively at trying to reduce cost. I think there is a part of the overall cost value equation, that gets a little hard to measure and you are probably seeing it exemplified, let me just say, in fighter airplanes. We are not replacing today the existing fleet of fighter airplanes on a one-for-one basis. You see it in the F-22, the current buys of 183, I don't know if there will be more F-22s ordered. The air force talks about 381 but that's to retire probably two to three times in the number of F-15s because the systems while we enjoy talking a great deal about their dollar cost, it's very difficult at times to talk about their value and how you are retiring two or three assets when you are replacing one. So, our goal here is to focus on cost, try to get the most economical possible environment in which to produce these systems. And I'll just refer you, Howard to my prior answer where when you get the conditions right, when the line balances, when there is funding stability, when there is requirement stability that is the time when systems are produced at their most economical basis and then when we look at the cost of the system, I don't think that it's always taken into consideration that this, if I pick on the F-22 that it's likely to be in-service for 25 or 30 or 35 more years. So, we are really buying a capital asset that has a very, very long life. So, the short answer is we do all we know how to do to suggest economic order quantities, multi-year contracts. The purpose in doing it is we know we give greater value to the customer and we know the customer always has more things to do than there is money available to do it. On a policy front there is a very active discussion about what threats exist today and what are the likely challenges that we will face tomorrow, will every future confrontation appear as an insurgency appears. And that is the kind of spirit that today we all have to be involved in. Our answer is that you need a mix and appropriate balance because our judgment about the global security context as it affects America is these trucks have got much more complicated. And it isn't that you get to pick among them one or the other one, you must be prepared now for threats that act a lot like individual non-State sponsored actors, terrorists, who can do an enormous amount of harm with the right technology, all the way through near peers who may have the propensity to express some muscularity to meet their individual interest for which the United States have to prepared. So, we are working with our customers on the broader front of preparedness. And trying to bring to bare all of our skills to help answer some of these very vesting problems and meet some of these demanding challenges.
Douglas Harned - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Jerry Kircher - Vice President of Investor Relations: Dana, this is Jerry. I think we are getting right up against the hour. Maybe, one more question.
Operator: Thank you sir. We will take our final question today from George Shapiro with Citi.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Yeah. Good morning, good afternoon Bob.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, George.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: A question, if you look at information services, I mean that's been the one area that's probably disappointed a little bit this year, the fourth quarter was only 5% organic growth which isn't bad but its less than what you had thought. You lowered the guidance for sales growth in that particular area for this year. Can you just go through what you think is going on in that business and what can be done about it?
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Bruce will give you some detail and color. I'll tell you, when you use the word disappointing, I watched this business during the year, undertake some important demands that I personally placed on them. and one is to take what was our disaggregated information technology businesses even in our organizational structure having two significant business areas and consolidating them into one business area, which as you know is no small task. So, I was very pleased with the operational efficiency that was undertaken in putting together our information technology capabilities, because now I think it gives us the kind of muscularity to move the market with a portfolio that no one else can match. And by that I mean very high end, system architecture, system engineering, highly complex, even classified programs throughout the value chain down the desktop applications. I don't know that there is a competitor in the field that can offer the breadths, the depth, the level of experience that we have and the kind of muscularity that's in that portfolio. If I look at their overall revenue expansion, if I compare '06 to '07, they were up 14% across that portfolio. That may have not met everybody's expectation, but I would say to you, George that is nothing. And I think there is more opportunity here as we continue to refine the integration of the business and we look for opportunities, both domestically and internationally.
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: George, if I could just take you back a little bit. Bob said we did 14% year-over-year growth within IS and GS, think of that as about half of that coming on the organic side. So, that was not a bad year by any stretch. This particular business area, by virtue of the contracts within that organization has the highest level of services contract accounting which creates itself some variability between the quarters. I kind of teed up in the third quarter call, that we were seeing some transitions from our recorded backlog to sales a little slower pace than we expect to have happen. But quite honestly, the backlog grew by over $1 billion, in fact, there was a record level of backlog within IS and GS, I think that's the best indicator of future sales potential, if you take kind of a just the mid-point guidance that we provided you, we are still showing 10% year-over-year from '07 to '08, that is the expectation, in excess of $1 billion of revenue growth. All well, we expect the margins for the business area to grow somewhat, probably 10 to 20 basis year-over-year. So as Bob said, this organization has just been combined for just a little less than a year and I think we are starting to see the synergies that come from that organizational combination. And we are pretty excited about was going to happen in 2008.
George Shapiro - Citigroup: Can you highlight Bruce or Bob some of the bigger opportunities in that business this year?
Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President: Well, the first one we looking for is actually. Let me say probably going to be awarded in the first quarter and could actually be awarded in say weeks to a month and that is a mission support contract for the BOE facility of Hanford, Washington. This is not nuclear waste remediation or environmental remediation. This is an information technology system management job. If you look over the lifecycle of the contract, you might even see $1 billion kind of class award here. So that will be good first test, we think, as to... we have able to put forward a very compelling value offering for an important customer information technology domain.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Just to piggyback back again George, the other big award we are looking at out of IS and GS, the AMF jitters is coming up also likely in the first quarter. That is a fairly good sized order. We have got a large, a fairly large IDIQ contract, which is kind of second round for the rapid response for the army coming up in the second quarter. In fact this gives you a little bit of the idea what's popping out.
Operator: And that does conclude our question and answer session. Gentlemen I will turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Robert J. Stevens - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Dana, thanks very much. Let me thank you all for your participation on the call today and your interest in Lockheed Martin. All of us here focused on delivering operational results for our customers and industry leading financial results of our shareholders. We are committed to maximizing shareholder value by building a balanced portfolio of businesses that will allow us to continue to expand margin as we grow our revenues organically and through acquisitions. We thank you for your support and we do look forward to speaking with you throughout 2008. Thanks again.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at this time.
