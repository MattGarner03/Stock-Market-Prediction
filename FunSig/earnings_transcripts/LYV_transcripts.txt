===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Joe, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Amy Yong. Thank you, Ms. Yong. You may begin your conference.
Amy Yong: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Nation first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino, and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. We would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments in similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the Risk Factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed.
Brandon Ross: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to dig deeper on the Ticketmaster results was surprised to see revenue and AOI down given the amount of ticketing activity and really the 2025 supply side in general. I see deferreds up a lot in the Q2 start and so I assume part of this is timing related in international markets in O&O. But what are some of the other factors that influence the results we expect improvement the rest of the year?
Joe Berchtold: Hey Brandon, it's Joe. I'll start with that one. So for the TM there are a couple of pieces both the activity that was reported in the quarter as well as the deferred. So for the activity that was reported in the quarter, what we had was more Live Nation concerts activity, less other promoters and less non-concerts activity. So more specifically for the quarter, Live Nation concerts through Ticketmaster were up 12% year-on-year. Other promoters were down 2%. And then overall concerts were up 4%. But other categories, sports, arts, family were down 9%. When we were doing our planning and talking a few months back on expectations for the quarter, at that point, we didn't have any reason to anticipate this lower level of activity in the other parts of the business. Everything that we've seen points to its supply, not -- no demand issues, it's just less supply year-on-year. And when we were doing some of our forecasting, we were expecting consistent levels and therefore, the growth in Live Nation would have carried through to higher growth. Then on the deferred side, yes, we have deferred for Ticketmaster up 13% for the quarter. If that deferred had all been recognized, revenue for the quarter would have been up. But overall what we have is more deferred between international volume growing, which is substantially deferred through the promoter allocation, continuing to increase our operated venue portfolio, well, the flip side is, as the costs get incurred in Q1, the AOI for those tickets doesn't get recognized until the events take place, which will be largely in Q2 and Q3. The other couple pieces of macro context, this is just what we're seeing is a bit later on sales timing with more concerts activity in H2 than last year. So we're seeing that those on sales and continued strength, particularly as you noted for April, being up 22% globally through the first part. And we expect probably two-thirds of the Live Nation concert fan growth to be in the second half this year in terms of when the events actually take place and that fan growth happen. So you're seeing a bit of just a little later timing of those on sales and you've seen some huge on sales for Chris Brown, Lady Gaga and others this month. And then finally, one area that is also hitting Ticketmaster is FX this year. While FX has rebounded for a lot of markets for Mexico and Latin America, it's still a headwind. And Ticketmaster took about 60% of that headwind in Q1 in terms of its portion of the overall company's headwind. And we project it to be kind of two-thirds of the headwinds in Q2. So it's going to have a little bit of a reported impact in the short-term. As you said, all of this is in the context of massive growth in deferred revenue for concerts and good double-digit growth in deferred revenue for Ticketmaster. So we're still confident we'll get some good growth out of Ticketmaster for the year, but we're not seeing it. We didn't see a play through in Q1 as much as we expected.
Brandon Ross: Right. It sounds from that answer that you're not seeing much headwinds from tariffs or other economic issues in the consumer yet. You could correct me if I'm wrong, but wanted to get a sense of what the potential disruption is if there is a slowdown in the consumer. And I guess, two legs to that, one is how much of the year, especially concerts is already in the bag through. Your on sales and then for the parts and sponsorship and then for the parts that are more real time like amphitheaters. What can you do if you do see the consumer weaken to protect AOI?
Michael Rapino: I'll start on demand and then Joe can jump in. I mean Brandon, on the concert side and it's the question every CEO gets asked, are you feeling the consumer pullback at all? We haven't felt it at all yet. So a lot of our stuff is on sale, October, November, December, so that stuff would have already been through the system. The real number we look at is what have we done from April 1 to April 21, the most relevant on sale period. We put a lot of shows on sale in the month of April. Chris Brown sold a million tickets this month, Mumford & Sons 300, Suicide Blonde; Lady Gaga sold out, up 18% year-over-year. So any data we have right now, up until last week, whether it's a festival on sale or a new tour or a show that went on sale, complete sell-through and strong demand and beating last year's numbers. So we haven't seen a consumer pullback in any genre, club, theater, stadium, amphitheater. We haven't seen it all happen yet. Two, sponsorship, we're up -- we've got over 80% of our business contracted this year so far. We're up over last year again because we deal on more longer-term relationships. We don't feel it. We don't have a weekly digital buy that can be canceled. Ours is the longer-term commitments and we still see brands flocking and exploring and we're attracting new brands all the time. So we've seen no sponsorship pullback yet. And as you said, the last thing that we really don't have enough data on yet would be the summer food and beverage and kind of onsite. We haven't seen anything. We had11 amphitheaters played out so far. We had a festival on the weekend. We've had theaters and clubs. None of that yet has said that they're buying one less beer or they're consuming less onsite on any consumer pullback. So we're actively working around our menu for the summer, pricing it right, making sure we got affordability built into it and a wider menu to attract and build on. But so far those three legs of the stool, the consumer demand, sponsorship and onsite, we haven't seen what others are seeing yet.
Joe Berchtold: And just in terms of Brandon, what we're doing is we're obviously tracking on a weekly and daily basis all of those numbers. How are shows that are going on sale doing? What's the sell-through level? How are shows closing? What's happening onsite? So we're watching all of that, Michael just gave you all the stats that are current. So we're continuing to watch that. We'll adjust as need be. And while we're generally growing, we've learned during COVID, we know how to take costs out. If we need to take costs out as a business, we're fully capable and ready to do that. We don't think we're in that situation. But we have every lever at our disposal that we'll continue to monitor.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
David Karnovsky: Hey, thanks. Maybe I'll just stick with the shape of the year. You said concert margin flat for 2025. I think historically you've kind of shied away from giving margin guide. Obviously the Q1 result versus 2024 helps, but maybe can you speak to the rest of your expectations, especially kind of Q4, which has some moving parts like it's a bigger quarter. I think for OCESA you have the advertising expense for next year. Just any kind of help there would be appreciated.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. Just we're looking through all the pieces and we're feeling good about how concerts is shaping up for the full year. I think even better than we felt two or three months ago. While your profitability is may not be as high in your biggest shows, you do get tremendous scale out of that -- scale out of the organization. And we're driving a lot of volume and big growth in volume while continuing to manage our cost structure. So we think that this year we'll be able to be at around the same sort of margin level as we were at last year. It's not a target so much as we model it out how it feels like we're going to end up.
David Karnovsky: A bit of a separate topic, but on your purchase of Hayashi, it seems like you've been circling a deal in Japan for a long time. Just wanted to see if you can give some background of the transaction. How should we think of this in terms of financial materiality or strategic benefits for running tours in the APAC region? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: Yes, it's been a target for a long time. It's an incredibly important market. One of the largest music markets in the world. It also happens to be one of the toughest markets to operate from the outside. You've got to be -- you've got to find local established partners to really scale your business. Similar like, we did it in OCESA in Latin America, Pacific Rim, we've been looking for this one to get done. There's three or four, pretty much three historic large promoters in Japan that have had a strong control over the market for many years. We're thrilled that we were able to finally get our deal done with that Korea, who is a young executive daughter of the original founder. We're really, really happy to be in business with her and her established family and business and it's already in terms of how we're planning to get a veil now we can promote directly in Japan. We're not selling off to other promoters who control the diaries of the venue. So huge strategic deal for us to have one of the founding Japanese promoters as our partner now. And it'll be continued building upon that in terms of our venue, our festival and bringing more shows there. So important step and it'll be another large AOI contributor to our overall business over time.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Stephen Laszczyk: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. In the press release, Joe, Michael, I think you mentioned the ramp in Venue Nation venues that expect to come online over the next year or so. Curious if you could maybe talk a little bit more about the pacing there and then to the extent we could expect any incremental returns to flow through the P&L AOI generation in the concert segment, for instance, how you would encourage us to think through that? And then, maybe secondly, just for Joe on regulatory, I think the latest update we got this past week is the DOJ stage trying to bifurcate the case. Curious if you could just update us on the latest there and how you're thinking about the case at this point? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: Sure. Just on the venues first, out of the 20, I think the current view is we're going to have four of those open by the end of the year. So I would take what we've given you in magnitude and probably just that's your clear run rate addition for next year from shows opening this year. The others will all open up next year. So I would -- I haven't modeled this out exactly, but I would -- I'd give a bit of benefit but certainly not a full run rate because it'll take some time to get those shows booked for the full slate. So I think you'll get the full run rate going into 2027, but next year will be a partial year. We'll guide you guys more as we get exact opening dates and a feel for how we're booking those venues. On the regulatory front, we're still mid process at this point. Continue to have an early March 2026 date for the timing of the court case. This is a period where you're spending these months' discovery depositions, working through. I don't think we have anything material, no surprises, nothing unusual that we just kind of continue along and it's part of the process at the moment and we're still hoping that when the timing is right we'll have an opportunity to get into some real discussions with them, but that hasn't happened yet.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Thanks. First, nice to see in the concert segment solid improvement in AOI per fan growth meaningfully higher AOI on I think a similar fan volume but any color on kind of what helped you deliver that improved per fan monetization at the concert segment this quarter?
Joe Berchtold: Yes, I wouldn't -- you know us, we don't tend to manage super tight on the quarters with some of that, there's so many moving pieces. I think overall what we're seeing this year, as I mentioned earlier on how it flows through the margin is because of the great scale of activity that we have relative to our cost structure, we're seeing some growth in those overall numbers that we expect to hold for the full year. We don't yet have the on-site activity at the scale in our amphitheaters and festivals to have that impacted yet, but it's just a good mix so far and some scale and we expect that improved profitability to carry over the course of the year.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Got it. There's obviously been a lot of venue mix and change has kind of been particularly active. It feels like the last couple of years as we look forward to 2026, do you think that we've kind of reached a point where the fluctuations year-to-year in venue mix activity start to look more stable going forward? Or any commentary on kind of where you see growth across kind of venue types occurring going forward or over the next several years?
Michael Rapino: No. I think, I mean on a macro level, we're thrilled that there's a new level of demand that's driving stadium shows, that people for years used to say who's going to be the next Rolling Stones? And as you can see by the lineup this year, these are young artists, new artists and established artists that are able to now sell stadiums around the world. So I think it's just a testament to the demand and the consumer demand out there. So no, I think there's things that like next year there'll be the World Cup that throws a lot of venue of avails off in stadiums. So you might have more arena dates than stadiums. The Olympics last year in Europe threw off stadiums in Europe. So there's some things like that that drive some of the avails. Our biggest challenge right now is finding avails in stadiums for next year and the year after on good Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. That sometimes drives you into arenas if you can't get your avails. But overall we just think it's a testament on a global basis. We just sold out a bunch of Coldplay dates in markets like India. And so we think globally stadiums demand is growing, will continue to grow; will continue to be a strong market for both festivals, arenas and stadiums. And the only fluctuation was just driven by some local economics in terms of other sports or other things taken up of avails.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Peter Henderson with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Peter Henderson: Great. Thank you for taking the question. So there's been a lot of discussion around like premium pricing and efforts to prevent leakage to scalpers in the secondary market. Just curious, how do you manage like the proper pricing model, which perhaps in certain instances doesn't mean immediate sellouts, while maintaining this perception of scarcity that perhaps helps to create a feeling of FOMO for fans. And also where do you think we're -- you are in terms of the proper pricing model? Is there still a lot of room to fine tune that model? And finally, can you just provide some additional color on the 8% decline for the average get-in price across stadiums and how you're managing affordability initiatives with revenue optimization? Thank you.
Michael Rapino: I mean I'll start on a macro. I mean, when you sit with the artist, the artists I always say, are the smartest brand managers out there. They're very focused on their fans, what they stand for, and making sure they're finding that fine line on affordability and paying for these fabulous shows, which are growing in costs all the time. These stadium and arena shows you might have 50, 60 transport trucks on the road, 400 crew. You're incurring millions of dollars in weekly costs. You're bringing a Super Bowl to a stadium every night and that artist is funding that. So they're trying to find that fine line always in how do we maximize pricing to put a great show on? How do we make it affordable for the fan? And then the third is how do we make sure we're just not giving it all to scalpers? So that's the premium pricing at the front of the house. A little bit of Robinhood strategy. Let's price the front a little bit better so the fan doesn't buy from a scalper, it buys direct. And then let's price the back end of the house a little cheaper. That's why you see some of the stadium prices come down. So how do you make sure you make it affordable throughout the house, but also maximize that premium inventory that is probably going to get resold anyways? So it's a -- it's an ongoing discussion. Every artist has a different philosophy on it. Every artist has a different size of show they want to produce. So you work with the artist, what type of show, how big of a cost, what's their weekly running cost, how much revenue they need to generate to fund the crew and the show. It's a pure startups. And then where's that fine line with what others are charging and what's the market dynamic? So it's an ongoing process. Artists are smart as can be. They got accountants, lawyers, they got smart people all around them. So they're always looking at all the data like we are and figuring out what's that fine sweet line where I can maximize my dollars and still be affordable for my clients. And I would say we're still early innings of the industry becoming better at pricing, smarter at it and the artists, managers and agents learning too, so. And different markets are at different levels, right? America's very advanced, Europe's very primitive still. Asia, South America, completely primitive. So you got what stage you're in, in the life cycle and rolling out pricing across other countries. And some of the learnings we have in America will take a few more years. So we're still in what we would call a global business, we're still in early innings of being really smart at pricing. How do you price a show on a Tuesday versus a Friday in LA versus Milan? What's the middle seat worth versus the back row? How do I maximize and sell it out? And as you said, a perfect show sells out as the doors close like for the first show you want to have that idea that you priced it right and maximize the market. And it's somewhere between a science and an art right now. And we provide a lot of data for our artist team to think through what is the best model for them. But still lots of opportunity for the industry to continue to price it better to sell-through as well as maximize some of the high scarce commodity tickets.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Benjamin Soff: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the recent executive order directing the FTC to more rigorously enforce the BOTS Act. You've been vocal advocating for this in the past, so just curious what you think greater enforcement of BOTS would mean for your business. Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: Yes, Ben, this is Joe. Combine both the executive order, the ticket act that's now underway, and some of the FTC requirements for all-in pricing. I think all of these changes are great. They are all moving towards creating more transparency for the fan and more scrutiny and regulation on the secondary market. The enforcement of the BOTS Act to make sure that we have actions being taken against bad actors that are cheating to get tickets and are doing so purely to make money for themselves for no real benefit to the fans. Some of the things in the ticket act which deter speculative ticket selling and makes increased transparency in other ways take place. So we are strong supporters of all these. We think that there will continue to be more to be done even after these happen. But we are strong believers that content should control and benefit from their shows, their ticket sales. And we think that all of this is part of the tide that is turned and is doing that.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Kutgun Maral with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Kutgun Maral: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a few on concerts. First, you provided a lot of helpful color in the release on various average ticket prices and indicated that you're implementing more price tiers across venues. I was hoping you could expand on this effort a little bit more and maybe what the driving force behind this is in terms of -- is this more of a precautionary effort or since Michael, to your earlier point, you're not seeing any signs of softness in demand or is it something else completely? And then Joe, sorry to beat a dead horse and ask about margins at concerts, but it seems pretty notable to me that you expect margins to be consistent this year on a year-over-year basis given the inherent volatility in the metric and the mix shift skewing back towards stadiums. You talked about volume and scale benefits. Is there anything different in the way that we should think about operating leverage in that side of the business? Or is there just a growing margin impact of Venue Nation? And I asked the Venue Nation bit because it kind of seems like you now expect Venue Nation counts to be up double digits this year versus the prior guide implying high-single-digits. So I'm not sure how much of an impact that could have. But any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: I'll take the second one first. Yes, absolutely. All these pieces matter, getting more fans into the Venue Nation buildings where we're counting the beer money and the parking and the other pieces, also continuing to grow the per fan spend, all the various initiatives we have to make sure we're catering to every fan from the traditional beer drinker to the person who wants non-alcoholic to the premium person. Doing everything we can to reduce friction and give everybody the best experience and extract as much money as possible from each person is going to continue to drive the economics of Venue Nation and then that will naturally flow through to help the margins in the concert business. Long-term part of that is just a footrace between how fast we can grow Venue Nation and how fast other parts of the business grow, which is why we don't get into too much on long-term margins. But as we sit here now, we see what buildings are opening. As you said, we're now expecting double-digit growth in fans at our venues which gives us some confidence we're going to be getting some good margin accretion from that. We're comfortable that we think margins are going to come in around the same as last year.
Michael Rapino: I'd have to ask you to restate the pricing question. I missed it.
Kutgun Maral: Yes, yes, sure. Sorry about that. The pricing question was more a matter of, you talked about how you're implementing more price tiers across the venues and I was just trying to understand the driving force behind that, that effort in terms of is it more kind of precautionary just in case something we see greater softness in demand or is there a different reason why you're trying to broaden the aperture of what pricing looks like across the venues. And I only ask because I'm trying to reconcile that effort with a commentary that you're not seeing any demand and softness and just trying to understand that move a little bit better.
Michael Rapino: Yes. No, we've been talking the pricing for a few years and just going from where we were as an industry, we were very, very static. We had probably three price tiers for a tour for the same cities for the same 40 dates. So Milwaukee, New York, it was $199, $126, and $69. Obviously, that doesn't make sense. New York on a Friday night is a different market than Pittsburgh on a Tuesday. So we've made -- when I say increasing pricing, it's to do both things. It's always our fundamental first goal is to sell every seat. Not to maximize gross and increase ticket prices, it's to sell every seat. Our business, as you know, is run by that. The more people in that building, parking and having a beer is better for us. So we're always looking to figure out how do you make sure you're adding lower tier prices to sell-through. Also, generally, you never ever sell back to front. You sell front to back. So as an industry, when we say 98% of our shows don't sellout, the show -- the tickets that don't sell are always the back to middle, never the front. So our job isn't to figure out how to sell the front better. That's already been done. It's probably price it more because there's higher demand for the better seats. Our real job is to figure out how do we sell the rest of the house. So when you're dealing with an artist and you're looking at the total gross for them, you want to be able to say, listen, we can go $39 tickets in the back because the middle now is going to have two more tiers at $79. So we'll make up the same gross for you, but we'll make it more affordable for the back end of the house. And that's maybe different on a Saturday versus a Wednesday and different in Pittsburgh versus Milan. So we're always just looking at all those variables now and saying, how do we best price the house to sell out completely and then maximize the gross. And similar, I've seen a lot of news around the buy now, pay later, Coachella 60%. That's a similar story on payment, right? We've been looking at that for years. A payment plan is nothing new. It's got way more noise or news than it should. Festivals have had pay programs forever. I think EDC created it probably 10 years ago. So most festival goers have that similar 40%, 50%, 60%. If you give a young consumer an option of spend $600 today or spread it over four months, of course, they're going to spread it over four months. It's probably a better program for them. So we're looking at all ways on how do you pay for it, how do you price it, and how do we continually sell out the house as the main goal.
Operator: And the last question will come from the line of David Joyce with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed.
David Joyce: Thank you. I wanted to ask about any updates you can provide on the secondary ticketing market. What have the volumes been trending like in this environment and what are you seeing in some of these newer regions such as in your OCESA markets? And technically, I was wondering if you could provide an update on what portion of the tickets have to stay within your ecosystem and what agreements do you have with other third-parties to enable broader secondary ticketing? And just wondering how that plays into the DOJ case. Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Sorry, David, I'm not sure I track the last part. We don't have anything where tickets would go off of our platform and directly into secondary. That doesn't exist. So that's not part of our business model, nor is it part of what we or any of the artists are doing these days. In terms of secondary market, we've talked for a long time. We consider this to be a feature as opposed to a standalone business. It's very different between sports and concerts. It's part of the sports distribution channel selling season tickets that then get broken down into individual games by teams just as they're selling to other fans, a lot of brokers buy those tickets. So -- but for us, it's a low-teens percentage of our GTV over the course of the year. We'll continue to offer it. We'll continue to advocate for reforms to make the industry as safe and positive experience for fans as possible. We don't see this as a growth driver. We've talked a lot in concerts. We'd love to see it decline because it means we're doing a better job working with the artists pricing their tickets appropriately. So I don't think there's any real change in it from our perspective.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back to Michael Rapino for closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everybody. Appreciate your support and have a great summer and we'll talk to you in the middle of summer.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-20 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is John, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Yong. Thank you, Ms. Yong. You may begin your conference.
Amy Yong: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Nation full year and fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. We would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, and new developments in similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the financial information section on Live Nation's website. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Laszczyk: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start it off from Michael, on consumer demand, you guys have put a lot of stadium supply on the market over the last few months. I'm curious if you maybe could talk a little bit more about the demand trends you're seeing play out across the slate so far this year? Is there anything that you're seeing that makes you any more constructive or perhaps any more cautious on the demand front since we last caught up in November before a lot of the supply went on sale?
Michael Rapino: Thank you, Stephen. As you said, we've had a great start to the year. We've got a lot of inventory in the marketplace. We are seeing continued strong demand. We're seeing sell-through rates at the stadium level higher than any previous year. We look at one stat, the first week on sales, we're selling through over 75%. That's much higher than the last year. So, we're seeing consumers buying up those stadium dates faster than ever, up year-over-year or any comparable base. So, no slowdown at all. Lots of inventory, but equally great demand selling most of these stadiums out or close to being sold out by the time we get to the show dates.
Stephen Laszczyk: That's great. And then maybe a follow-up for Joe. Given that inventory that Michael spoke to on the stadium side this year and the mixed shift in that direction, I'm curious, Joe, if you could speak a little bit more about the puts and takes on concert segment margin or maybe how we should think about AOI growth this year, how does the mixed shift back towards stadiums in '25 impact that? And I'm curious as well that the visibility you feel like you have on the venue nation amphitheater side of the equation this year, now that factors into AOI growth for the segment.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. I think that this year is going to be more like a 23-year as we look at how we're growing the business. With all this stadium volume leading the way, I'd expect to see some good revenue growth. I think Ticketmaster, first and foremost, will be a big beneficiary. I talked a lot about last year on the other side that it took 10 AMP shows to deliver the kind of revenue for Ticketmaster's one stadium show. Now we have all those stadium shows, so I think you'll really see that benefiting on the Ticketmaster side. I think that we continue to have a sponsorship business that's performing extremely well. We note here 75% sold, up double-digits, so you expect that to continue to deliver some ongoing strong growth. Then on the concert side, all these shows, all these stadium shows, we're absolutely making money on attractive returns. We just don't get to count the beer money and the parking money as we do with our own venues. So I think it will ultimately come down to the pace of revenue growth versus the pace of AOI growth, which we don't know yet because we haven't gotten into the AMP season. So the latter part of your question on how much growth do we get on our per caps at our AMPs, at our festivals, theaters, and clubs over the course of the year, all of that will just help determine the exact balance of revenue growth versus AOI growth there. But we expect to see all of all the businesses performing well this year, and as Michael said, in aggregate, continuing to deliver double digit AOI growth for the business.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.
Brandon Ross : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Something that stood out in the release to me was that Ticketmaster transacted ticket volume, you said was up only 3%, and then the event related deferred at 11%. I thought that would have been much higher given the pipeline and, frankly, the answer that you gave to Stephen's last question. Can you guys explain the -- disconnect for me?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. Let me take the two different pieces because I think they're slightly different in terms of what's going on. So Ticketmaster transacted volume, as you noted, is up 3%, while our concert tickets are up 10%. So if you look at the numbers, our concert tickets are up around 6 million. The TM transacted tickets, which is everything at the high end of all of our tickets to at the lower end, family shows and other lower-priced things, up 3%, but off of roughly almost double the base. So what you have is, at this point of the year, strong growth in the Live Nation concerts that Ticketmaster has been selling. You have a bit less activity in some of the other, whether they're promoters or some of the other activity in the Ticketmaster buildings. But we're still very early in the Ticketmaster scheme. It's about 100 million tickets, and we ended up the year, last year, at about 330 million tickets. We expect to see growth off of that. So we're at a pretty early point for the Ticketmaster volume as opposed to somewhat further along on the Live Nation side. So I think it's a bit early to read too much into that number. Then in terms of the deferred, I think the on-sale timing this year was slightly different than what we saw last year. This year, because we had such a strong stadium lineup, that really owned the fourth quarter in terms of the majority of the on-sales. So that drove growth. But we didn't have as early of on-sales on the arenas and the amphitheaters as we had last year. Last year, because we didn't have the stadium volume in the end of '23, we saw some earlier on-sales on the arena and amphitheater side. So that's in effect why you got at the double-digit level of deferred growth at that point.
Brandon Ross : Great. And then, Michael, you talked a lot about the strong demand for stadium shows, in answering Stephen's question. But just optically, I look at some of these shows and I see a lot of high-priced tickets still on-sale for high-profile shows. Do you think ticket pricing is getting ahead of itself, or is there some other explanation for that? And how should we expect apples to apples ticket prices to grow this year? So, stadium versus stadium.
Michael Rapino: Yeah, I think you're seeing, the artists in general, every cycle is a little more educated on what's the best way to price my ticket, how do I keep it accessible to my fans, but make sure scalpers don't run away with the front of the house. So, we love seeing these stadiums sitting somewhere around 95% sold out right now. The instantly sold out at 10 a.m., means we've transferred a lot of wealth to the scalpers. If you see any of those tickets, any tickets you're talking about are going to be the high-end tickets sitting on the market. Those will flush out between now and show date. So, we think these artists on their stadium pricing are priced at almost perfection, where strong, strong demand. They also added more venues, which we love. So, they're helping consumers get to more shows at a good price, but also making sure that that's priced closer to market, which means you'll have a few high-end tickets sit around the rim until we get closer to show date. So, that's the perfect on-sale and land the plane on show date model.
Brandon Ross: So, would it be silly to partially think about it as you're taking away from secondary ticketers or ticket platforms and that's moving more to primary now?
Michael Rapino: Yes, for sure. I think the artists over years, we've been saying this for years, every tour is looking at that P1 and making sure that if their fans are going to buy it, they would rather buy it from them direct on show date than two days later from a secondary site, hours included. So, yes, artists are going to figure out how to keep pricing the P1s a little more aggressively, price the bottom, back into the house slower, so we've got a great sell-through. Those artists you're talking about, any inventory you see, we could sell that out in a minute if we drop the price, right? So, finding that right combination where you're making sure demand and supply kind of March along on the way to the show date versus the 10 a.m. buyer sale.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone : First, I just want to say thoughts go out to you guys and everyone in the LA office after everything that's happened this year. Pretty tough. Hope everyone's hanging in as well as can be expected. But, Michael, one high-level question for you. As we frame the opportunity you've laid out for sustained double-digit AOI growth over the next few years, I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether you expect the drivers of that performance to evolve over that time frame or whether it's really just down to executing against a similar playbook as what supported the growth that you delivered here in 2024. And then one for Joe. On the outlook for $900 million CapEx in '25, another big increase similar to what we saw in '24, what would you say investors should take away from the decision to ramp that so healthily in terms of the ROI you're seeing from that spend so far? Any help with framing the timing from kind of investment outflow to the returns showing up on the P&L will be helpful.
Michael Rapino: I'll go back to your first question, if I can remember it. But yeah, listen, we've been, we love consistency over here. So if you've been following our stock, and you've been to our investor days, the last few years, we don't --we haven't deviated really from what we think our thesis of why the industry is a great industry. On a global basis, we think live has a real global unlock, and will be a high single double-digit kind of industry for the next decade, as we saw our Coldplay show in India, sell out largest single concert in history, 125,000 people, we saw those dates sell out instantly. So we've been talking a lot about the globalization of the consumer, supply demand of the globalization, untapped markets to grow still. So our model is the same. We're 100 offices in about 40 countries, keep growing those offices, growing our market share in those underdeveloped markets. And we will continue to follow that global trend of more consumers wanting to go to shows from Pittsburgh to the Philippines. So we think the industry is growing, we tend to grow better than the industry and be able to capture the revenue from our consumers walking in the door.
Joe Berchtold: And Cameron, I think, in some regards, your second question is the same as your first question, right? Which is, if our thesis is, is we're going to grow to 200 million fans is the next step and the different levers we have, and venue side is a key piece of it, then certainly our capital deployment is going to mirror the delivery of that AOI growth. So I think we should take from the fact that we're increasing our capital spend is we're continuing to see a lot of opportunities that have very attractive returns globally. Again, heavily focused internationally on the arena level, globally focused on these large theaters, both types of venues that cannot just deliver attractive returns, but also move some reasonable volume of fans, expand our shows, grow the market. So that's the biggest takeaway I take from that. In terms of the timing, these projects are all different in terms of how long they take from shoveling the dirt through growing it out. What we're trying to do, and we gave you some pieces here is some understanding of when or what venues opening to how many millions of fans to give you some guide for how we're seeing the impact roll-in.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky: Hi, thank you. So just wondering, music labels and DSPs have recently come to agreements that may allow for super premium tiers. And wondering if you thought of potentially about the role of live music within some of these offerings, maybe it was something like ticket access, is there inventory that could be made available and could this be a potential sponsor opportunity?
Michael Rapino: Yeah, thanks, David. Yeah, we currently -- our job is to use that inventory that we've acquired from the artist and maximize it through sponsorship currently. And we have a lot of pre-sale programs in place with, you've seen them all, Verizon's and Citibank's, et cetera. So, our job is always to look at that show, work with the artist and figure out, is there ways to maximize that inventory to business, as well as consumers. As far as the latest rounds of Spotify and Apple and Amazon, they've approached us all, we've talked to them all about ideas if they wanted inventory. There's a cost to that and we would entertain and look at that option if it made sense for us in comparison to other options we have for that pre-sale, which is a very valuable asset. The artists themselves tend to do their own deals. We do deals for the artists, but ultimately the artist has control of it and that artist's job is to maximize the revenue from it. They're not giving that away to anyone for free. So whether we partnered with them and found sponsors or we paid for it, it's valuable. And it wouldn't surprise me, of course, the labels or the distributors if they're trying to add a $5 premium to a monthly subscription and they don't have enough of their own inventory in terms of music or free songs. It's always the easy go-to, let's give them pre-sale access. The hard part about pre-sale is just scaling it. Everybody wants Beyonce pre-sale and that's hard to scale. So we've been working with all three of them, trying to find a model that may work for us and them and soon they're talking to others also.
David Karnovsky: And then maybe just separate, the DOJ antitrust nominee recently indicated some openness to settlements where effective remedies can be put into place. Just wondering what room you see to advance discussions with the agency or relative to the prior administration. And then just separate to this, are there any updates you can give on just the trial in terms of timing or notable dates to be aware of?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, this is Joe. The trial process continues to move apace as it has targeting early next year for a trial date. So question is, is over the course of this year can? Is there a path towards a resolution with the DOJ that doesn't lead to the trial? We've said in the last administration, there was really no interest in any discussion on settlement. So we're hoping that this DOJ returns to a more traditional approach and is open because they don't own it in the same way to those discussions. But we haven't had any discussions yet. The person that you would discuss it with has not been approved yet, not been appointed. So until that happens, there's nothing we can do. And we'll see how that plays out in the coming months, but nothing really substantively new.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research.
Peter Supino: Hi, everybody. A question on Venue Nation Capital. I'm wondering if the 2025 budget, which I think you detailed as being $200 million or $300 million greater than 2024, is showing any change in the mix of U.S. versus international? And then a parallel question on the large arenas for the 15,000 to 20,000 seat segment. I'm wondering if those opportunities are coming any faster or slower than you imagined and whether your appetite to invest in that particular segment has shifted at all. Thank you.
Michael Rapino: I think we'll see. I was just going to jump on a second. The large opportunities on an international basis are coming consistently ongoing. So continues to see that ramp up. We tend to be the first, second phone call if you're a developer thinking about building or have land and want to use that land or have a venue you want to sell. So we see that pipeline growing and our appetite still remains very large to expand in that platform.
Joe Berchtold: And just on that same thread, Michael, just answer the first question too, which is, I think that in general, you'll see a trend towards more of the capital being deployed internationally because of the attractiveness and volume of those arena opportunities.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Peter Henderson with Bank of America.
Peter Henderson: So just wondering, I mean, there's been some concerns over the softness of U.S. consumer, particularly in the low end recently. It doesn't sound like you guys are experiencing any of that. But coming back to sort of Brandon's question as well, are you seeing any trade downs from more affluent cohorts? And what are you seeing sort of from the more value conscious consumer? And just related to that, I'm wondering, you recently announced that there will not be a long past program in '25. And I'm wondering if you give any color on sort of the size of that and why the decision was made to end that program and what other programs you're considering?
Michael Rapino: Yeah, I mean, overall, the demand we're seeing for the concert and I assume, the NFL has got the similar answer. We're seeing no pullback. It's still on a global basis. We're seeing strong demand. We're seeing it in a small to big. So, yes, Beyonce's are always going to have incredible demand. But if you look at my club business, we're going to do 30,000 club shows last in a year. Our club business is up 17% a year-over-year. So that's kind of the simplest way to say, bottom end on a Tuesday in Indianapolis, my business is doing better. Consumers are coming to the club to see the young bands. So we're seeing our festivals, which are on sale already. They're selling at record levels. So I'm seeing no pullback in any festivals from EDM to our country festival. As we always say, someone will write about one that gets canceled or a dog here and there. But generally, overall, Macaulay, our festival business globally is stronger than ever. Our club and theater business is stronger than ever. And obviously our stadium business is on fire. So whether it's geographical, whether it's venue type or whether it's festival, we're still seeing strong, strong consumer across the board in terms of buying tickets for the '25 season. As far as the long past, so very small program. And we put some new leadership in charge of venues this year. We expanded Jordan Zachary's role and put some new thinking around how do we sell the summer amphitheater? I think our belief was we were discounting too much too early with some of the programs we had. So was to pull back and relaunch, which we always do. Our annual Concert Week is kind of our big if you want to call that our Amazon Prime Day. Our Concert Week, later in the summer or earlier in the spring, beginning of the summer. That's kind of our big, big deal where we sell all of our volume that matters. So we're going to just consolidate around that bigger idea. And we're going to eliminate some of the smaller programs that we're selling, small, small volume of tickets overall.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citibank.
Jason Bazinet : I'm a big fan of the CapEx you're spending, so don't take this the wrong way. It's just a clarifying question. When I look historically, then your nation, you'd own, I don't know, less than 10% of the venues most released or operated or whatever. Is this CapEx really moving more overtly into outright ownership of these arenas? Is that what we're talking about? Or is it spending CapEx and then having the right to lease it at a lower rate or operate it?
Joe Berchtold: A chunk of it is absolutely owning it. Every situation is different, but we're following your advice and trying to own more. Go upstream. So if we're in a situation where we can own it, dirt on up, we do. Sometimes we can't own the dirt. We'll own the building, can't own the building. We'll do as much of the capital build out and minimize our lease. So you don't always have exactly what you want, but we're absolutely pushing it further upstream, if you will.
Operator: And the final question comes from the line of Kutgun Maral with Evercore ISI.
Kutgun Maral: Another one on Venue Nation, you provided a lot of great color at the Investor Day on the mid-term outlook. I know the impacts to the model gets a bit tricky because, as Joe mentioned, timelines vary greatly depending on how the shovel-to-dirt to growing the venue out process looks like. But it's an area where we get a lot of questions on. So I was hoping you could help us think about what the AOI impacts of Venue Nation maybe was in 2024 and a little bit more specifics around how you see that evolving in 2025, just given the growing venue base there?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, we haven't really tried to break it out for you guys as a segment. First of all, part of it or a good chunk of it obviously comes from the sponsorship side. We've talked that two-thirds of sponsorship is venue-driven. So you've got a component over there. Then you've got the operating component, which is heavily driven by your beer and by your parking and so on. So we haven't really tried to fully model it and break it out that way for you, unfortunately. We try to use what we present at Liberty is the overall guideposts over a midterm basis, as you said, to then try to back in and say, how are these pieces potentially going to roll out, how do they maintain the sort of growth profile over the next several years, and am I comfortable they're going to be able to do it? But we're not really in a place that we're going to break out and give you the stand-alone Venue Nation business model.
Operator: And I'd like to pass the floor back over to Michael Rapino for any closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everybody. Look forward to talking about Q1 in May.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-11 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is John and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Yong. Thank you, Ms. Yong. You may begin your conference.
Amy Yong: Good afternoon and welcome to the Live Nation third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino; and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. We would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments, and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website. With that I'll turn it over to Joe for brief remarks.
Joe Berchtold: Thank you, everyone, for joining our quarterly conference call. I think we'll go right into questions on the release. And as everybody knows, we have our investor presentation coming up Wednesday and then again on Thursday.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment while we poll for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Brandon Ross: Hi. Thanks for the questions. First, you gave a lot of very positive forward-looking indicators in the release. I was hoping you could help us think about how that's eventually going to flow through the P&L. And I guess on the Ticketmaster side, it's been a tough year. Assume that outlook on stadiums is going to reverse that trend, but how will that look over Q4, Q1 and next year from a timing perspective? And then on Concerts, it was a big margin year. Can that continue next year in addition to the obvious topline growth that the indicators are showing?
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Brandon. This is Joe. I'll start and then Michael can add. Starting with Ticketmaster and starting with Q4, as we noted for October first quarter of the month, Ticketmaster sales were up 15% year-on-year. Concerts, they're up 23%. So, we're expecting that great stadium and arena pipeline to start to manifest itself in Q4 and deliver a very strong Q4 in Ticketmaster. Next week alone we have over 200 stadium and arena shows going on sale. So, we're, I think in a period of unprecedented level of activity for Ticketmaster in Q4. And then that will continue into Q1 and through next year. We expect next year's Ticketmaster to look more like a '23 where you've got that great volume of stadium activity that you get with the on sale, but then you also get as it plays off and some of the deferred events that you have in Europe that you recognize as the events play off. So, a strong Q4, strong next year for Ticketmaster. Concerts, obviously, next year, expectations strong for a continued AOI growth, having growth in arenas and amphitheaters from our baseline of this year. Added to that, the more like '23 or beyond in stadiums should be very strong revenue growth, very strong AOI growth. I think it's probably a bit early to know the exact mix of all those venues for margins, but overall, both strong revenue and AOI growth for the Concert business.
Brandon Ross: Okay. And a lot of investors think that Trump is going to be a very good thing for you. I'm sure you've studied it very closely. Just wanted to hear what your thoughts on, are on how he's going to approach antitrust and the associated remedies. Do you think they will favor structural or behavioral? And then separately, from a timing perspective, when do you think you'll next have an opportunity to get to the table with the DOJ? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks. Yes, I think, it's still very early in the transition process. So, we're hesitant to say too much, but absolutely, we are hopeful that we'll see a return to the more traditional antitrust approach where the agencies have generally tried to find ways to solve problems they see with targeted remedies that minimize government intervention in the marketplace. And without getting into the specifics, at least some parts of the case, we think believe reflect a much more interventionist philosophy today than you'd expect of a Republican administration. Obviously, the request to break up Live Nation and Ticketmaster would be an example of that highly interventionist approach. So, we'll obviously be ready to engage as soon as they are. They need to get through the appointments and get things settled on their end, but we'd certainly be hopeful that we could start engaging with them early in next year.
Brandon Ross: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. Just two from me. First, on the revision to 2023 financials. Can you walk through what triggered that and what the notable changes are? And I didn't see it in the release, but you have an updated '23 AOI and free cash flow. And then second, you called out for Q4 a possible mid-teens FX impact to NOI due to LatAm. Can you just refresh us on the general mix of LatAm versus other regions in the fourth quarter? And then any early view on how to think about FX into '25? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Sure. So, first on the revisions to the financials. So, for context, what we had is we had a non-cash non-operating tax adjustment that we had to make. This has to do with when we purchased Ocessa and a difference between statutory and US GAAP accounting on some non-consolidated investments. So, it was just on the US side. We missed -- we paid the taxes in Mexico. We missed it in the US. It was not material to our '20 or '23 numbers, but working through with the auditors, we made the decision, it made sense to restate those numbers. So, again, a one-time non-cash non-material to those numbers. In terms of the FX impact, we had previously talked about Q4 this year looking strong in Latin America, which it still does. All the operating metrics we've been talking about in terms of both the supply and the demand profile are looking good. We've also just seen a downturn in the FX on Latin American markets over the past several weeks. And because we had a disproportionate amount of growth in the numbers coming from those markets this fourth quarter, we just wanted to flag that, therefore that has a disproportionate impact on our AOI and NOI for the quarter. We don't look at it as being material when you step back and you look at the full year '25 and the magnitude of activity that we're going to have. It's more just a Q4 modeling point for people to be aware of and we'll see how some of the FX plays out over time and we'll update you. But I don't think it's a material '25 issue at this point. It's really just more a '24, which tends to be our lowest activity. So, when you have your lowest activity quarter and you have where your growth is coming from get impacted by FX, so that can just start to swing things around.
David Karnovsky: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. Maybe first for Michael, you called out in Sponsorship the number of strategic partners increasing by 20% this year. I'm curious, looking out to '25, how you would encourage us to think about the Sponsorship business next year. Are there any verticals of the business where you see maybe outsized opportunities for execution where you could replicate this performance? And then second for Joe, on the Concert segment AOI in 4Q, you called out some of the on-sales coming in over the next couple of weeks here. I'd be curious if you could help us think about how much marketing spend could be associated with those on-sales and maybe any color on just how to think about 4Q Concert segment AOI. Thank you.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, Stephen. On the Concert, on the Sponsorship side, again, we'll be giving more guidance this week as we get to our Investor Day. But Sponsorship has continually been our star for the last decade or so, multiple years of double-digit growth. We look at this business still very, very strong, very different than maybe some of the advertising challenges other companies have. We see overall companies spending more money on-site experiential and moving dollars into that segment. And anytime that happens, that's good for our business. We tend to rise with that. So, we look at '25 and onward as continual AOI growth that we've been able to deliver in the past in Sponsorship. One of the foundational drivers of that is our globalization. And every time we do more shows around the world, we provide ourselves more opportunity and more sponsors. So, when you're doing all these Latin American shows, when you're doing shows now in India, Middle East, Singapore, Asia, growing our Australian business, it just provides us more and more inventory to open new borders and new relationships. So, as our global pipe continues to grow, so will our Sponsorship and we'll see continued growth.
Joe Berchtold: And Stephen, as it relates to Concert in Q4, obviously, Q4 in Concerts is a peculiar beast because in some regards, right, the more we're ramping up for a great next year, the more that impacts our AOI. So, I think, as we're standing here, we'd expect a double-digit increase in our advertising expenditure that we have to write off at the end of the year. We're certainly ramping up activity and personnel to be prepared to handle the tremendous volume of shows that we're doing next year. But I think even with all that, as we're looking at the numbers now as again as the broad context, we do expect our margins for the full year in the Concert business to land around where they were in 2019. I'm not going to worry three or four months from now, plus or minus 10, 15 basis points, but I think that in total, we expect it to come in around where we were in 2019.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you both.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Thank you. On the CapEx increase, I was wondering if you could provide some color on what the pipeline right now looks like for new venue opportunities. And then for the new AMP project, anything further on what changed to pull that forward? I'm assuming that was already in the pipeline as of July, and it's more of just a timing consideration, but any color there? And then to follow up on the Sponsorship question, Michael, growing the number of partners that are generating over 100, sorry, 1 million. Can you talk about, is that new sponsors or is it expanding current or existing relationships? And maybe what's allowing you to execute, if it's growing those relationships, what's allowing you to execute so well there? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: Quickly on Sponsorship, see, for a few years, we've been saying anytime you can take that regional relationship or that started that relationship at a large brand, form that relationship, deliver for them, we tend to do good at then getting the next time around with the CMO talking broader programs. So, we continue to grow our current base of sponsors. We tend to have a very good renewal rate and we tend to be able to upgrade you once we've gotten you into the ecosystem and understand your brand needs. So, most of it is coming from current customer base of our 900 to 1,000 sponsors and growing our current base with them and then obviously expanding outside markets. On real estate, Joe will give you the updates. We continue to have a great pipeline. We'll take you more of details for you this week in terms of what venues are going to be kind of rolling out into '25 onward and the CapEx returns on that.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. And on the specifics of the CapEx here for the quarter, as you know, we often build buildings in partnership with others. So, this is a situation where we have a partner we've been talking to for an extended period about doing an amphitheater together. That partner had already put a fair bit of capital into the ground and it was only recently that we then signed the formal agreement. By signing the formal agreement, which would give us controlling interest in the amphitheater, we then need to move all the CapEx onto our books. So, you saw the increase of $50 million of expected CapEx for the year, but you also saw a $30 million increase in the capital coming from other parties. So, most of the capital on this project is what a partner has already put into it. So, the net cash that we're putting out is somewhat less than that. In terms of the new venues, as we noted in the release, we expect to bring 14 more venues online, either with substantial refurbishment or new-build over the next year and change through the end of '25 accounting for about 8 million incremental fans. As Michael noted, we will get into more detail on sort of the mid-range planning on venues over the next couple of days.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Got it. That's all helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Peter Henderson with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Henderson: Can you provide some color on what initiatives are resonating most with fans and driving up the per-caps? And where do you think per-caps can go over time? And then just related to that, I mean, how much opportunity remains to implement tiered experiences and where are you monetizing on super or premium fans the most versus regular or casual fans? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: Well, I'll give a quick shot again. We'll get into more detail this week because those are pretty strategic broad questions. On the premium fan or super fan, I know I hear other companies talk about it. We've been selling to the super fan for quite a while, we call that the premium fans that launched a VIP experience at the show. So, that's kind of been an ongoing skill-set we've had forever. Our job every year is, we see that pie still underserviced. We've used percentages in the past 2%, 4%, 6% of the show is premium. We think it can grow up to 20% and more. So, a lot of the refurbishments we're doing at venues is about taking regular seats and turning them into better experiences for premium experiences at night. So, we think premium experiences is a big underpin to our entire growth forward because it's using the same customer base, but we always sell out of the boxes, sell out of the premium inventory first, we never have a problem selling that. So, we think that is a big part of our CapEx and our refurbished as well as our new buildings. When we're building them, we're starting with this mandate that they must have a certain higher percentage of premium seats and lounges and experiences. So, those venues start with a much better return. First question, shoot again the first question.
Peter Henderson: Just what where do you think -- what initiatives are sort of resonating most with the fans and driving up per-caps? And where do you think per-caps can go over time?
Michael Rapino: Most of it is, I've said this before, sports, these new venues, the $1 billion arenas have done a fabulous job, the stadiums, the SoFi stadiums. They've all kind of -- we're all following the same playbook. We all probably started in a very traditional food and beverage offering, whether that was the old forum here in LA versus the new Intuit Dome, it's night and day and most of it is around having more POS, it's around having different high-end value offerings in the -- in your food and beverage bundle to both having mocktails, non-alcoholic options, higher-level food versus the traditional food. So, that's the ongoing path we see in our amphitheaters, our theaters, our arenas. We've been using this $2 per head growth over the last few years. We think that's something in the future we can continue on. So, it's all-around upgrading our current customer base, our apps. Our venues probably are the lower-end of good, great quality F&B from historic measures. So, every year, it's about upgrading that amount of POS offering, upgrading our selection, increasing our premium offering, and all of that combination, we think still has lots of runway left.
Peter Henderson: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Katz: Hi, evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Number one, past week or so has brought quite a bit of change. I'm wondering if your thoughts have started to shift or philosophies started to shift around M&A given sort of the change over the past week? And then I have one quick follow-up please.
Michael Rapino: No, we haven't, nothing's really changed in the last couple of years, the way we've been moving around the world and building our business. We don't have any sizable M&A targets that we would do with or without where the regulation stands in America. We like kind of what we're doing. You see us at an arena in Austin, at an amphitheater in some white space or a 5,000 seat, and similar around the world. We're always kind of looking in these 100 cities that are out there that want great entertainment and whether it's an amphitheater or a festival or promoter we like bolting those on and we have a big pipe of those around the world. Nothing has changed over the last two years and I don't think anything changes going forward.
David Katz: Okay. Understood. And I just wanted to ask a more general question about the secondary ticketing market, which I recognize is a smaller part and in some sense a strategic portion of kind of what you do. But it seems as though every time we have something like a World Series and ticket prices get high, it just draws a tremendous amount of attention that sometimes is seems a bit misplaced toward you as the biggest. Are there any strategies or and maybe this is not the best forum to talk about them, but it's just something that comes to mind that we've written about a bit and I thought I would raise it and see if there's any answer that's appropriate here.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I think it's, go ahead.
Michael Rapino: Much broader statement, but yes, we are always a little amused that sports is kind of a badge of honor how expensive those tickets go for, but music which is priced much lower than sports seems to get more of the emotional reaction. But America seems to be a market where secondary is free-to-run. We hope there's always been this hope between different legislators would get better regulation around secondary, hasn't really come to life yet around that minimum at least bots and spec selling and some of the other practices around secondary that we'd like to clean up. So, we hope over time seems to be more and more attention around the secondary market. So, we hope over time, better regulations get put in place to help the consumer.
David Katz: Got it.
Operator: And the final question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Supino: Thanks. Hi, team. A question about Ticketmaster. With all the activism at the DOJ, a question that we've heard a lot in the last year has related to the defensibility of Ticketmaster's competitive position and one of the pillars of that is technology. And so I wondered if you could just comment on the investments that Ticketmaster is making in technology, whether it relates to bots or demand-generation or other initiatives that you think are the most important ways Ticketmaster is reinforcing and extending its competitive position technologically? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Sure. Yes. And Peter, as you know, we spend tens of millions of dollars in capital on Ticketmaster. I think first and foremost, we need to continue to innovate the products that we offer to, on the enterprise side to our venues, to promoters, others who use the platform. Past recent years, that's included a lot around pricing technology to help everybody understand the market value of the content they're delivering. It certainly also is on the marketing side, developing great marketing science capabilities to help people market their shows. Big investments over the past couple of years on continuing to enhance our ability to handle that high-demand on-sale. We think Ticketmaster is the best in the world and we've seen a number of on-sales recently where Ticketmaster has been able to deliver a much better experience and sell tickets at a volume that others have been unable to handle. And then obviously also just on the ticket itself, all the things that we've done around digital tickets and as you said, trying to stop bots. So, range of consumer-facing technologies as well. We expect that's ongoing, right, Ticketmaster is a technology company. So, we're going to continue to be developing products on both an enterprise and a marketplace basis.
Operator: And at this time there are no further questions. Now, I'd like to pass the call back over to the Live Nation management team for closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everybody, and look forward to talking more about our business this week.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Live Nation Entertainment Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Amy Yong, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, Amy. You may begin.
Amy Yong: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Nation second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino; and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures, and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website. With that, we are now ready to take your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Joe, on fan count, it looks like it grew 5% in the second quarter with some diverging growth trends between North America up 26%, international down 16%. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the attendance trends you're seeing across region and then within that across venue type. And then maybe related to that, there's been a lot of attention just on tour cancellations and consumer demand over the last few months. Could you comment on what you're seeing on that front, then to what extent you think that demand extends into the back half of the year and what that means ultimately for attendance growth into the back half of '23? And then I have a follow-up for Michael. Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: That's about a four part question. Let's start with some of the easier pieces. In terms of cancellation rates, our cancellation rates, we're seeing historical norms below last year. They historically run kind of 4% to 5% of shows, about 1.5% of fans, absolutely in line with historical trends. I think most of the reports that we've seen have been efforts to take one or two data points out of a very large number of tours and shows, and we're just not seeing anything unusual there. In terms of overall demand, continues to be extremely strong. We tried to highlight here a couple of casual fan metrics that we think are important where obviously, we've heard a lot of things from other companies over the past weeks or month or so. One is, just when we put on promotions or summer concert week back in May or more recently our four pack promotion, those tend to be focused on the casual fan, and we've seen increased interest of fans and their purchase behavior, so that's positive signal. The other signal that we look at is, how do shows close in the last couple of weeks before the amps play off, are people buying more of those lawn tickets as they're making the last minute decision on whether or not to go to the show, that number is up 16% year-to-date. So again, seeing very strong casual demand there. And finally, once they go to the show, what's their behavior, and again, we're seeing no issues that we continue to be on track for a couple of dollars' growth in our APF spend at our amphitheaters. So I think it's all consistent with our concerts being seen as very good value, two-thirds less than $100, a third of them less than $50. It's a much more memorable event than a lot of other experiences you can get at that price point. So we continue to feel very good about the strong level of consumer demand we're seeing. In terms of the specific fan count numbers that we've seen over the quarter and over the first half of the year, I think it really is venue type driven. It's not so much geographic driven. It's very consistent with what we've been saying for the past year. This was not going to be a big stadium year. You're seeing that play out in terms of lower stadium shows, lower fan count, that impacts our international number. North America, where we've had very strong performance, particularly on the amphitheater side. As you see here, we said amphitheater attendance up 40% for the second quarter. So it's really that amphitheaters are up very strongly year-to-date. Arenas, theaters and clubs, all up double-digits as well. So you're seeing in totality continued growth despite the -- not having the stadium shows this year. And just from a geographic standpoint, that happens to benefit the U.S. doesn't make any comment on any kind of macro longer-term trend. As we head into the back half of the year, again, no underlying issues on fan demand at all. We expect to see continued growth in the fan count over the course of the second half. I think most of that will come in Q4, Q3, you'll see the continued impact of the stadium show count. And I think we had -- if we just look at the summer season, Q2, Q3, probably about two-thirds of your amp growth in terms of shows and fans was in Q2 as we got started earlier in the year and the majority of arena shows as well. So -- but we expect still solid fan demand growth -- fan growth overall for the second half of the year, again, probably more in Q4 than Q3.
Stephen Laszczyk: Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe just for Michael. As you look out into 2025, any early reads on how the auditorium pipeline is shaping up. I think, in the press release, you mentioned it was expected to be a busy year. Just any more color or commentary around that, particularly on the stadium front and arenas and amps as well.
Michael Rapino: Yeah. As we said from day one, this is never going to be a big stadium year. We're thrilled that we can still grow the business coming off two years of extraordinary growth, given where we were in 2019. So it's still a strong year for us overall. Stadiums were always the challenge, international was always going to be a stadium issue given Paris Olympics. Most of France shut down for that month, and most of that affected a lot of the stadium business for the summer. So the good news is, as we predicted, '25 looks like to be a big banner year again. We're looking right now at our stadium pipeline for '25. It's bigger right now than it was two years ago for '23. Our amp and arena is bigger right now than it was last year at this time in terms of our pipeline. So we've always thought 2024 would be the year of AOI and amphitheaters and arenas and '25 will be back to a solid continual growth of stadiums. And as we've always predicted post-COVID, we'd be back to an 8%, 9% compounded annual growth as an industry on the top line, and we'll see that come back to life next year and probably more.
Stephen Laszczyk: Okay. Thank you, both.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question
Brandon Ross: Thanks. I'll try and keep it tight. Just as a follow-up there on Stephen's seventh question, I think that was. Just in terms of the stadium activity and what does that look like for you in terms of ticketing performance the rest of this year? Should we expect a big Q4 this year, similar to the types of Q4s that you were putting up in larger stadium years? And where does that kind of bring ticketing overall for the year since there's relative weakness in Q2 and Q3 given the mix?
Joe Berchtold: Sure, Brandon. Let me also just start that with a little bit of context. I think we look over a multiyear trends entering this year since 2019. Ticketmaster AOI was up around 130%, sponsorship around 85%, and concerts around 35%. So I think one of the things we're seeing this year is, as you'd expect, as the businesses grow, some normalization and those numbers start to come together more. So that said, we -- our views on Ticketmaster remain unchanged. We think it's going to be a mid-single digit growth this year. It's going to be Q4 driven by the on sales Michael was just talking about with the stadium activity. And I think in general, a lot of people have just under-modeled the stadium impact, good and bad. I think it's been under-modeled, the upside in Q4. As I've said in the past, from just purely a ticketing perspective narrowly to how they do their numbers, one stadium show is triple the fan count and triple the average ticket price of an amphitheater show. So while overall, those amphitheater fans are very valuable to us as a company and have helped drive our AOI growth this summer and this year overall, as you look specifically at the ticketing segment, you're going to see it impacted the other way.
Brandon Ross: Great. And then just overall on the lawsuit, I don't want to ask about where you stand with the DOJ, but just wanted to ask how that whole situation overall is impacting your strategic decision making. When you look at M&A opportunities, both domestically and abroad, is that piece of it in the back of your mind and laying how you allocate capital now at all or are you just straight ahead as if there was nothing going on?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. We're able to isolate. So if you're -- in my legal department, you're working on the DOJ. If you're running any one of my divisions, it's business as usual. So we are -- we've always said for the last while, we've been focusing on ventilation, global venues around the world. I think we put in that press release, we've got 15 coming online over the next year. Still 75 or so in the pipe. I had a venue meeting this morning. We looked at 10 new venues that we're looking to build across the U.S. Latin America and Asia in the pipe, so business as usual. We think there's still a great, great white space on a global venue basis and ticket, I think you saw last week, we expanded ticketing in South Africa and have a few more of those on an international basis. So lots of opportunities still ahead of us and business as usual in the divisions.
Brandon Ross: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: Hey. Thank you. Joe, Michael, we've heard from some other live entertainment companies recently kind of talked to a pull forward in demand post-COVID, and that's starting to normalize. I'm curious for your view on this, as it relates to comps or do you think there was any pull forward from kind of late '21 through '23? Is there anything in your kind of data to indicate that the frequency of concert going ramp to an unsustainable level and is now kind of moving back to trend line?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. I find the concept to pull forward for experiences like concerts to be a little bit of an odd one. I think that we have long said this is a supply driven business. The demand is there, notwithstanding the fact we have a lot fewer stadiums this year. We're actually still growing our show count. We're still growing our fan count, We've talked a lot about new artists. We talked a lot about global artists, Afrobeats, Latin, K-Pop, exporting country. So I think what we're seeing is an acceleration of the continued globalization on the demand side, the artist seeing that they can go everywhere in the world. We'll have some shifts in terms of venue types and exactly which markets have which level of activity. But there's nothing that would suggest that we're really deviating from historical trajectories on the ongoing growth of the business.
Michael Rapino: [Multiple Speakers] We never predicted that the industry was going to grow at 30% a year going forward. We always wanted to restate that regardless of some of the COVID pent-up demand or some of the shows that got moved around this industry on a global basis, supply demand are the basics still sound, are they going to grow at a 9%, 10% a year growth rate. And we see all of those trends we've talked about over the last year. Globalization, consumers wanted to get to the show from Colombia to Pittsburgh, globalization of the artist, supply/demand, experience economy still make this industry overall, probably one of the best industries you're going to find out there, continued double-digit growth amongst many of the divisions as well as on a global basis and a 9%, 10% annual base.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And then your amp show count and attendance growth were particularly strong in the quarter. Joe, I think you might have said before more of the show count growth slowing to Q2 this year due to an earlier season. And can you just frame what that should mean potentially on a relative basis for AOI growth for margin in Q3 relative to Q2?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. I think Q3 is pretty much always our high water mark on margin as we have the high volume of festivals in addition to the amphitheaters. I'd see no reason for that not to continue. We expect to continue to have AOI growth as a result of that margin expansion. I'm just trying to -- I was trying to give you guys a little bit of more specific context for the modeling, but we expect this to be a very strong AOI growth year for concerts. I gave some of the numbers earlier, where I talked about more normalization. So we do expect concerts to carry a lot of growth for the overall company this year. And we think that margins are moving back towards 2019 levels. I always hesitate to give exact margin forecast because a lot of it depends on our volume of on sales in Q4 that results in the expensing of marketing, but expect that we're moving back towards the 2019 margin levels on a full year basis.
David Karnovsky: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Cameron Manson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Thanks. Two, if I can. Noticed that take rate has been up nicely at Ticketmaster this year, year-to-date. Is that success in some of the efforts that you've taken to kind of improve the ancillary monetization there or what's factoring into that? And then Joe, on the higher CapEx guidance, given the comment about pull forward in the release, does that mean lower growth in CapEx next year? How should we think about that? And on the note that you expect to generate free cash flow conversion consistent with last year despite how CapEx is ramping this year, just any context in terms of how you're achieving that given the CapEx ramp.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. I think in terms of the pull forward, what we spoke -- we're speaking to specifically is we're now expecting to have 14 major venues open between '24 and '25 as opposed to the 12 that we had last quarter. I think it's very early to start talking about '25 CapEx, as Michael talked about on an earlier question, we're regularly looking for all the venue opportunities we can find globally. He spends a lot of time with the teams in every market, looking at that. So I think that we'll continue to make those decisions on next year’s CapEx based on the opportunities. And hopefully, there will continue to be a lot of great opportunities with kind of 20% plus return profile that we tend to look at. In terms of the free cash conversion, I think those numbers, the cash conversion that we use is after maintenance CapEx and before growth CapEx, so the growth CapEx numbers since the growth in the number in the forecast was in growth CapEx. I don't think that impacts how that number flows through. Back to your first question in terms of the Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster is continuing to perform well. Again, adding a lot of clients internationally, continuing to have strong renewal rates, both in North America and internationally. We're growing our upsells and ancillary spend with the ad units at Ticketmaster. So I think the underlying performance and the health of the business continues to be very strong. The fact that it's -- the AOI in Q2 was actually as high as last year given the volume of stadium shows that they lost in the second quarter, the fact that it's still one of the top five quarters that it's had are all indications of the great performance and strength of that business on a multiyear basis.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Got it. All really helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Supino: Hi. Thank you. I was -- I wanted to ask two questions, one on the concert segment with really high growth. I wondered if you could parse the contribution from Venue Nation versus the Promotion Function? And then a question on growth CapEx. Your press release talks about 30% returns on venue upgrades. And in prior discussions, you aspired the 30% returns on some greenfield venue builds. If Venue Nation generally does invest capital at a 30% incremental return, should we take the difference between total CapEx and maintenance CapEx and multiply that by 30% to forecast a return on your growth CapEx or would that be an oversimplification? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: So first, on the Venue Nation versus the concert promotion, really because that's transfer pricing, we don't spend a lot of time trying to separate the two. We don't have, I would say, fully distinct P&Ls that would give you at the AOI level, I think, what you're asking about. We do look at the returns that we generate, the returns that we generate from all aspects of the business to give you a feel that we're creating a lot of shareholder value as we're opening new venues and making other CapEx investments. I think that what we've said historically is, we strive for 20% north or higher on major renovations and new builds, and as we showed here, 30% plus on some more tactical improvements. This is also all the venue based CapEx. There's also Ticketmaster and other CapEx that we make. So I think it's probably a bit of an oversimplification, particularly if you're trying to apply it to a single time frame given that the CapEx is often ongoing for a couple of years on the major projects. So you have a little bit of timing complexity there. So it's probably just not quite as simple. Over time, you get those returns, but not if you're trying to do this on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
Peter Supino: Thanks, Joe. Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Barton Crockett: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask maybe a little bit more about what's happening with sponsorship. So the revenue was up 3% in the quarter, but AOI was up 10%, and you're guiding for the year. You're talking about double-digit bookings growth and stable margins. I was just wondering if you could explain what drives the acceleration in the top line but kind of the give back on the margin? And just talk generally about the health of what you're seeing in sponsorship at this point.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. I'll give you some specifics on the margins, and Michael can comment on overall. I think the business continues to be a 60% plus margin business, very strong. I think as I long said, when overanalyzed single quarters, I think over the course of the year, we'll continue to deliver similar margins as we have in past years. This is all apart to, as Michael talked about, when you have a high-single digit growth business that underlying in the industry level, and we're overdelivering that, part of that over delivery is if you look at sponsorship, it’s been in the teens historically on an AOI growth basis. And as we continue to grow the fan count and grow the overall business, we expect we’ll continue those sort of historical growth rates.
Michael Rapino: Yeah. And I would just say, as an overall, given I work with the team a lot on our big clients, we’re seeing discontinual upgrade moving from a regional deal to a global or a national deal. That has been our biggest strategy over the last five years, is upgrading from a local to a national deal with a larger relationship and a longer-term relationship more integrated. And the lineup continues to be strong on all major brands. All CMOs look at us kind of like the NFL and want to find ways to work on our digital, our on-site, our festivals, our tours, the artists, all the different ways they want to attach the live music. So we think continue to be a great business on an AOI growth basis for a long time.
Barton Crockett: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Michael Rapino for any closing comments.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everybody. Have a great summer, and we'll talk in the fall.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is John, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.
 I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Yong. Thank you, Ms. Yong. You may begin your conference. 
Amy Yong: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Nation first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino, and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. 
 We would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, regulatory and legal matters, new developments and similar matters. 
 Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. 
 Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website.
 With that, I will now turn it over to our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. 
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Amy. We appreciate there's a lot of interest in what's going on with the DOJ. So let me address that upfront. We obviously know about the press reports claiming DOJ Antitrust division has decided to file a lawsuit against Live Nation, potentially seeking a breakup of Live Nation and Ticketmaster. At this point, we're just about to begin discussions with senior division leadership about the issues their staff has been investigating, which is typically in the final phase of an investigation. 
 Decisions about whether to see over what relief to seek ordinarily made at the end of that process. Of course, we know that some competitors and interest groups are urging the DOJ to sue us and sue us to break us up. Let me add that -- let me address directly. 
 As we previously stated, the DOJ's investigation appears to be focused on specific business practices, not the legality of Live Nation Ticketmaster merger or our overall business structure. Very little of the conduct that DOJ has raised with us relates to the combination of ticketing and promotion resulting from the merger. And most of what does was anticipated and addressed by the consent decree allowing the merger to go forward. 
 Based on the issues we know about, we don't believe a breakup of Live Nation and Ticketmaster would be a legally permissible remedy. 
 Live Nation and Ticketmaster came together lawfully through a merger that the DOJ reviewed and approved subject to divestitures and other remedies. The DOJ has repeatedly stated in court filings that the merger and settlement were in the public interest. Furthermore, structural relief such as the divestiture is rarely granted. Legally, it's only available where there is a strong connection between the corporate structure and the company's ability to engage in the allegedly unlawful conduct. 
 We believe that connection is lacking with regard to the bulk of the issues in this investigation since the conduct under scrutiny falls either within our ticketing segment or within our concert segment and not across those segments.
 We're looking forward to our upcoming meetings with the division leadership and remain hopeful that we can amicably resolve any remaining disputes. If not, we're prepared to defend ourselves in court. 
 That's all we're going to say on the DOJ on this call.
 And operator, can we now open it for questions for me and Michael? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. 
Brandon Ross: I think you probably hit the biggest investor questions with your statement on regulatory, but I think there is one big question that's remaining in investors' minds. And that's, how do you see the relative value of Ticketmaster inside Live Nation versus as a separate stand-alone company? 
Michael Rapino: Thanks, Brandon. I think we addressed this in our last call. At Live Nation, we run a very decentralized organization, and I'm very proud that we've built 3 incredible businesses sponsorship concerts and ticketing, and we're about to embark on our fourth venture around Venue Nation. So these businesses all run incredible core businesses on their own. Ticketmaster, as you know, was a stand-alone business for many years. 
 We're proud that when we took it over, we were able to bring some leadership to it, upgrade its technology, open up its platform and elevate its consumer and marketplace much like most enterprise platforms like Airbnb and et cetera. So I've always said these are incredible portfolio of pieces around Live that we own. They are all part of what we think is a great portfolio. But I've also said these are incredible businesses on their own. So I think long term, together or separate these would all be very successful businesses. We happen to think that we like our portfolio today and plan on keeping it. 
Brandon Ross: Great. And then you're continuing to express confidence in double-digit AOI growth this year. Obviously, you exceeded that in the first quarter, but deferred is actually down. Can you just quickly reconcile that? I assume the makeup is the profitability per fan based on the venue mix, but any additional color you could give would be helpful. 
Joe Berchtold: Sure. I think there are sort of 2 questions within that question, Brandon. The first is what's going on with consumer demand and then technically what's going on with the numbers. So just to make sure we hit hard on the consumer demand. We are seeing no weakness. The things that we look at that give us an indication of how the shows are selling, how the fans are spending when they go to the site, all continue to be very strong. 
 We alluded to some in release, but just to hit a few of the highlights. When we look at a number of artists that toured last year and they're touring again this year, so those are the best like-for-like examples of demand. We're consistently seeing the sell-through of shows are at or above where they were last year and that the overall grosses for the artists are consistently higher. So no issues at all on fan demand relative to last summer. 
 And when you look at our overall arena volume, which is the largest volume at this point early on, despite a tremendous growth in terms of the number of arena shows, which you could be concerned would lead to some cannibalization. We're seeing no such cannibalization. We're continuing to see strong sell-through as strong as it was last year. 
 And then when we look at on-site spending, theaters and clubs, where we have the bulk of our activity in our venues in Q1, we're seeing strong growth on fan spend. So just to make sure we hit that out of the gate. 
 And then technically, what's going on. I think what's going on with deferred revenue and ticket sales is 100% consistent with what we've been saying for the past 6-plus months, we expected that this isn't going to be a big stadium year, stadium tickets sell earliest. They're also the highest-priced ticket, so they're going to lead historically to a very high deferred revenue number at this point of the year with a shift to more arenas and amphitheaters, you're going to see the sales cycle come in a bit later. And overall, the story for the year is going to be less of a revenue story, more of a shift in the portion of the fans that are in our venues, higher fan profitability, concert AOI growth through margin expansion. 
 I'm still confident -- we still believe in the double-digit growth that we've been saying. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky from JPMorgan. 
David Karnovsky: We've seen some noise in the press recently around festival demand and that maybe some of the more established events in the U.S., Europe, are seeing challenge in moving tickets. Just wanted to see if you could dig in a bit on what you're observing for live or even the industry? 
Michael Rapino: Yes, I'll start. We've read some of it also. We haven't said it in our business. We have over 100 festivals around the world. I think currently, ticket sales are up double digits year-over-year. So we're seeing a strong start to our festival portfolio. We also remind you festivals are a huge business around sponsorship, similar to venues with our sponsorship is up over 20% year-over-year on festivals, so we're seeing a strong, strong start to them. 
 We're a global company, so we do see that having a portfolio helps. We've launched some new festivals internationally. We launched about 10 new festivals a year. You're lucky if 50% of them make it to the next year. And I think this year, we started 10, we shut down 6. So you're always kind of cutting off the weak performers and restarting some new ideas. I think the only trend we see overall is, I think the 3-day massive festival that's going to appeal to everybody with a great unique headliner. The kind of with the original part of this business, that seems to be really hard to deliver year on, year out, whether it's Coachella or Bonnaroo, those are big missions to deliver and artists are making a lot of money in arenas and stadiums. So it's not as easy to get that special headliner. 
 Where we're seeing great success, though it's 1- or 2-day festivals that are appealing to a more of a niche, and it's maybe 35,000 people, and it's exactly write down a certain genre of music or a lifestyle, and it's maybe a higher-end business like BottleRock does in Napa. And we've got a couple of great calling festivals out on the coast or Eddie Vedder festival on the [indiscernible] outside of San Diego. 
 So we are seeing probably a shift to more niche 1- or 2-day festivals with higher per heads, higher sponsorship value and less big swings across, let's go after a 3-day 100,000 people. There's still, though, the Coachellas, the Lollapaloozas, the Austin City Limits, they're kind of passage of right, so they'll -- they seem to have a life and will live long. But definitely, if you're starting a new one, you're probably starting a more niche strategy and try to make sure it's a better experience versus just putting 75,000 people in the field. 
 But to us, a big part of our business overall, it's a nice piece in our overall portfolio to drive our sponsorship business, and it's on a global basis, a nice piece of our overall portfolio. 
David Karnovsky: And then on your venue strategy, just as you look to deploy capital to locations around the world, Can you discuss kind of criteria where it's best for Live Nation to execute independently versus where we've seen you kind of partner with a third-party like an Oak View Group, for instance? 
Michael Rapino: Yes. We do it all. We've been partners with Legends and Spanaway Group in Boston, bunch of ones in the hopper right now across America on 5,000-seat venues with certain sports owners, everybody that has a sports arena is looking to build out their retail footprint around it. So we're in partnership with -- potential partnerships a bunch of different NBA, NHL or NFL owners who are building out their concourse retail area, and we'll partner with them in capital to help build that out. 
 So we're opportunistic depending who the developer is, and sometimes if there's a partner that makes sense to partner with like we did with [ OBG ] in Austin, we'll do it. But around the world, I would say I was in a venue meeting this morning. We are very, very excited about this division. I called it the fourth leg this morning. 
 The global pipeline of where we think we can take this business that's very unsophisticated outside of America around the AMP Arena large theater business. The lineup of -- the pipeline is long. We've got a lot that we're going to keep rolling out over the next few years. We can do them 100% of our own. Most of the time if the economics are there or if there's a developer, we always will look at that and see if that's a better return on capital also. 
 I would say we are probably the -- we're the one that everyone wants to partner with. So we have great optionality. We are always kind of the first demand partner that a developer is looking to bring us in and be partners with. So we have great opportunities and more opportunities than execution of power right now, but we're building that muscle fast. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Laszczyk: Maybe one on sponsorship for Michael. Revenue was up I think, 24% year-over-year in the quarter. It sounds like a lot of that was driven by strengths internationally. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about what's driving that growth in international? And is the step-up that we saw in 1Q, something we should expect to see throughout the year, or is the fact that it's more internationally driven? Does that suggest it could be more 1Q, 4Q aided as we move throughout '24? 
Joe Berchtold: Stephen, this is Joe. I'll get started and then Michael can hop in. A lot of what you're seeing in Q1 is, as you said, it's international. A lot of it is festivals, as Michael was just talking about the high performance of our festival business this year. And in particular, it's what's going on in South America and Asia. So one of the things we really like is that we're balancing out getting the sentiment the Southern Hemisphere growth that will help our Q1 and Q4 business. So I would expect we'll see a good chunk -- we'll see the highest growth rates in sponsorship Q1 and Q4 this year because we're getting real traction building those businesses. 
Stephen Laszczyk: Got it. And then maybe another one for you Joe or unless Michael wants to jump in on sponsorship? 
Michael Rapino: No, I would just -- I want to remind you some like sponsorship or any of these numbers we're talking about. The growth is just -- we had an incredible comparable last year. I mean we had 2 record years of incredible growth. So the fact that we're sitting here again growing the business at these levels, I think it's just a testament and a mic drop to anyone debating how powerful the machine is, how hungry customers are to show up at the show and whether the pipe is full or not. So we're extatic to have a 20-plus percent sponsorship year-over-year after growing bigger numbers than that the last couple. 
 I think the demand from brands is big, people -- brands, while they're struggling to figure how to reach customers, know that being on-site, live, touching consumers at festivals and venues and the spheres and all these great live experiences that are happening, it's a very, very hot space, and I think you're going to see this growth continue. 
Stephen Laszczyk: Got it. And then maybe just one on concert margins for Joe. You called out in the release, full year concert segment margin is expected to be higher than last year. I think with the magnitude of that, depending on some factors, could you just talk a little bit more about the range of outcomes there? What would dictate coming in, I guess, meaningfully above last year versus maybe more in line? 
Joe Berchtold: Sure. I think probably 3 factors that we're still going to watch play out over a bit of time. One is FX. As we noted, for Q1, we, on a reported basis, were up 7 basis points year-on-year. At constant currency, were up 37 basis points. So clearly, that can have a material impact on how much we grow. 
 Second is just what's the level of Q4 arena activity we have? Q4 is still in the process of being booked. And as you guys all know, the reason I don't love going too deep in the margins is because if we do a lot of arenas in Q4, that could bring down our margin while bringing up AOI and we'll do that all day long. So there's still some visibility to get into those numbers. 
 And then finally, we've talked on the last call about how '25 is already shaping up to be a tremendous stadium year. A lot of the stadiums that they couldn't get access to this year because of the Olympics or Rugby World Cup or any of a -- variety of reasons, they're already stacking up very strong for a great stadium year next year. 
 The only accounting impact of that is you put those shows on sale in Q4, you incur the marketing expense to launch those shows, particularly for stadiums, and then you have to write off all that marketing expense at the end of Q4. So again, irrelevant over the life cycle of the tour, but from a strict accounting standpoint and impact on margins, the more stadium tours that we put sale in Q4 globally, the bigger the expense we hit. So we'll work through all of those numbers as we get closer and provide more guidance. 
 But right now, those are all big factors that are all really good things that have happened, but aren't yet at a point to declare exactly what the margin expansion is going to be. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. 
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: So I want to follow up on 2 of the earlier questions on growth and then on the venue business. I guess, first, on the growth outlook for the year. I think you've spoken to potentially more muted growth in the first quarter given the venue mix considerations this year, which makes a 20% growth look even healthier. So maybe -- could you just help frame how we should think about growth this year in light of all that? And then on the higher CapEx outlook from new venue opportunities, Joe, you've talked in the past about generally wanting to prove out CapEx and then ramp it gradually over time. What should the higher outlook tell us about the opportunity you see from this incremental spend? 
Joe Berchtold: Sure. On the growth, I think Q1 should tell you that we are right to be positive and optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver double-digit growth this year. I gave a little bit in the context of Brandon's questions, but as I step back and say, how is our growth going to look at the end of the year? I think it's going to be driven by concerts AOI heavily concerts margin. It will second be driven by sponsorship as we're continuing to, in particular, build out the international side of that business. And just Ticketmaster because it's losing all those stadium high-ticket price shows is going to have lower growth. 
 So I expect all of the pieces to continue to grow and all of them to be very happy coming off of what as Michael said, were tremendous growth rates over the last couple of years. So to have all 3 pieces of the business continuing to grow is great. I just think that will be the overall tenor of how it is we look back at this year. 
 And in terms of the venues and the CapEx, I think what we should take is that all the buildings that we're opening are performing at or above our expectations that the volume of opportunities, as Michael said, every developer is coming to us as their first choice, whether you're a sports team owner who want to replicate what Fenway Group did around their park, whether you're an international player looking to renovate a building or to build something from the ground, the developers are coming to us because they think that we're effective operators and good partners in terms of helping them make the building successful. 
 So I think it's just a continued build-out of the pipeline, and this is still incremental but continued strong performance and strong pipeline. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. 
Peter Supino: I wanted to ask first about -- more about the venue build-out project. I'm wondering if in your comments 3 months ago, about longer-term growth view that the company could compound AOI at a double-digit rate for many years to come. If you didn't build any big 15,000, 20,000 student arenas outside the United States, could you still achieve that goal? It's just a way to ask whether that capital project and the returns from it are built into your long-term outlook. It's a question we've heard a lot from clients. And then related to that, I wonder, when you talk about returns on capital, maybe as a company or specifically on these venues, how are you [indiscernible] those returns? Is that an EBITDA number? What are the numerator and denominator? 
Joe Berchtold: Yes. In terms of the venue build out, of course, that's part of our long-term plan. I mean we lay out every year, generally at Liberty, the 6 or 7 levers, and how it is we're going to continue to drive strong AOI growth over time. When we did that last year, venues were, I mean, the largest component of that. So it's absolutely part of our thesis and part of how it is we're going to get to that continued strong growth rate. In terms of the performance, I mean it's a standard return on invested capital. So we look at it on a cash-on-cash basis, cash out, cash back to the business. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citibank. 
Jason Bazinet: I just had 2 questions related to disclosures actually. I know you guys have been building venues for decades, but when you talk about standing up a fourth business with our destination, are you hinting that you might disclose that as a second segment or not? And then my second disclosure question is, I noticed in the Q, there was something, I guess, that FASB came out with in November about expense disclosures. I don't know if the Q says you're still sort of deliberating that? But any sort of color on what that FASB request is, and how you're thinking about it would be great. 
Joe Berchtold: In terms of venues of the [indiscernible] business, at this point, we're not thinking about them as separate segments. We still organizationally have concerts and venues under the same organizational structure. So it'd be premature to think about it in terms of the segments down the road, who knows. It's just -- we're trying to get everybody internally also focused on this as an important area to be growing. So that's why we use that term loosely. 
 In terms of the -- any FASB, generally, what we're doing is any time there are new accounting regulations, we're going to be studying them until the day that we need to implement them. So I don't think anything here would be any different. We're just going to always use the time we have to make a full assessment of what lead way we have, and how we do things and make the selection and prepare whatever revisions we need to be ready. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. 
Benjamin Soff: Just wanted to ask about concerts attendance. It looks like there was a bigger step up in North American attendance compared to international tenants this quarter. So can you unpack that a little bit and talk about how you think about growth in each region for the year? 
Joe Berchtold: Sure. I think that is largely a function or fully a function of the international stadiums we had, particularly Southern Hemisphere in Q1 of last year and just fewer stadiums as we've been talking about. So that meant that the primary growth in Q1 was in North America. Overall, this year kind of define the trend of where international is going, which is an increasing share because a lot of the growth will come out of our amphitheaters, I probably would expect disproportionate growth out of North America. 
 Again, I think it's out of character in the sense that if you look at all of the business where we're adding capacity with our venues, where we're adding ticketing clients, where our sponsorship is growing, we've got a heavy structural trend towards international growth and international being a larger portion, I think that just from a cyclicality standpoint this year, there may be a bit of aberration in that, but no change in terms of the overall trend. 
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of David Joyce with Seaport Research Partners. 
David Joyce: Two questions, please. First, when you look at the metric of country attendance versus the population, the U.S. over index is the rest of the world. What would be your path to growing that concert attendance per capita going forward? And then secondly, on ticketing, what are the plans from here for upgrading the ticketing platforms around the globe, and what -- how much is in CapEx versus OpEx? 
Joe Berchtold: So in terms of driving the fan attendance, we've been talking in North America for past several years about a hyper-local focus and that has absolutely been helping us drive our penetration, if you want, on a per fan basis. That will continue, and our expectation is we'll continue to build our fan base in North America. 
 The other thing that's just generally going on is, every year, you have the same artists who've been touring -- back out touring on whatever cycle, and we're adding in more hours. We added in K-pop. We added in Latin. Now we're adding in Afrobeats. So we're adding in more artists, which also draw more fans, and that will continue to help with the penetration. 
 As we look at the international markets, it's all a function of how penetrated are they in the major cities where we have a presence. In a lot of markets, we think that there's the opportunity for driving that through additional venues, ties into our international venue strategy that Michael was talking about earlier. In other markets that may be more penetrated like the U.K., you're going to see more of a hyper local strategy, which is why we continue to focus on making sure we got a lot of activity going to Manchester, not just London. 
 So every market is a bit different, but certainly a focus on how we continue to get more fan growth from the biggest to the largest. 
 In terms of ticketing, I think we've talked a lot about the tremendous progress we think that we've made. We think we've got the leading enterprise software system in the world, and you continue to develop products for that. A lot of that cost is in CapEx, but it's been a pretty stable investment level over the past couple of years. We expect it to continue as we are delivering new products for both the enterprise customers in the marketplace, but nothing dramatic changed. 
Operator: I would now like to turn the floor back over to Michael for any closing comments. 
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everyone, and we'll look forward to talking to you in the summer. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is John, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. And I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Yong. Thank you. Ms. Yong, you may begin your conference.
Amy Yong: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Nation fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino; and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website. And with that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: Hey, great, thank you. Good afternoon. Maybe one on the mix shift in the slate and one on Sponsorship. A lot has been made on the mix shift shifting more towards the amphitheaters this year. Maybe for Joe, just from a modeling perspective, could you help us think through how the mix shift will impact the cadence of revenue growth and margin expansion across the Concerts and Ticketing segments in 2024? And maybe how we should expect the business to pace towards the double-digit AOI growth you called out in the release? And then, on Sponsorship, maybe for Michael, you had two notable tailwinds to the Sponsorship business this year: MasterCard is replacing Amex, and you have Rock in Rio, which is a bi-annual event coming in this year. Is there any way you can help us size the contribution from these two factors and perhaps where else you're seeing demand in the Sponsorship business this year? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: Sure, Stephen. This is Joe. I'll go first. In terms of the mix shift, there's several dimensions of this. Let's start with deferred revenue. Deferred revenue in the level to which it's up is impacted on a timing basis by what we've talked about in terms of stadium volume being lower this year, amp volume being higher. So, you have less Q4 far ahead on sales with the stadiums, so that's going to compress that deferred revenue line that you see as of the end of the year relative to what you'd see in a more normal year. Then, in terms of how that specifically flows through on the concert side, because it's going to be a shift to more outdoor with the amphitheaters, it's going to be more heavily weighted to Q2 and Q3. It's going to have a higher AOI per fan, because we're counting the beer money, the parking money, other revenue streams when we have the fans on site. It will mean, just on a top-line basis, a lower revenue per fan because the stadium tickets tend to be the highest price tickets, so you'll see a real divergence there between the AOI per fan and the revenue per fan. That, obviously, will translate into improved margin on the Concert segment this year, which should particularly come through in the second and third quarters. On Ticketmaster, the way it flows through is that it would have had fewer on sales in the fourth quarter because the amphitheater shows tend to go on sale closer in time to the shows. So, we still outperformed, grew Ticketmaster in the fourth quarter, increased our number of fee-bearing tickets by about 5 million. But that was against the headwind of that mix shift. So, we expect to be selling more of those tickets into Q1 and Q2 for the amphitheater. But because those tickets are deferred from a revenue recognition standpoint at Ticketmaster, you won't see the AOI on those tickets until the shows play off in Q2 and Q3. On the Sponsorship?
Michael Rapino: Stephen, does that help?
Stephen Laszczyk: Yeah, that's helpful. And then, just on Sponsorship.
Michael Rapino: Yeah. I just want to give Joe a macro level on the kind of concert supply just so we're aligned. This is going to be a great year. We're pacing ahead on our arena and our amphitheater business, which is the higher-margin business as we've talked about. So, we're going to have a fabulous year. We're going to be able to monetize that around the world. We actually look at '25, looks like it's going to be a monster stadium year again as that pipe kind of reloads itself. So, I wanted to just make sure on a macro level, we're seeing continual artist supply at record levels. And we made decisions this year, Usher could have been in stadiums. We wanted to get them in arenas this year and put a great show together. Justin Timberlake, Bad Bunny in arenas versus stadiums. So, you make those trade-offs in different years. But the good news for us is we're going to have a fabulous arena/amphitheater year, festival year around the world. That's going to drive our overall AOI margin cash flow. Probably bounce back with some bigger stadium activity in '25 and then the cycle will continue. But as we've stated over our Investor Day, we look at this as continual growth year-over-year industry for the next 10 years on a global basis. And we'll see that again this year. Sponsorship, to your macro point, the demand we're seeing, strong as ever. I just spent some time in New York with my team with some clients, Verizon, et cetera. Our demand in terms of clients that want to be part of this live experience surge right now is stronger than ever, as you can imagine. Most CMO's want to sit down with us and talk about how can they have some part of this live explosion on a global basis. So, we're seeing, as you've seen with Mastercard and updated deal with Verizon and others to be announced, our pipe is up year-over-year. We expect this to continue to be a double-digit growth business, as we've seen in the past. We've seen nothing slowing down there.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you, both.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Brandon Ross: Hey, everyone. How are you doing? Joe, you talked about amps in the answer to the last question a lot in the mix shift this year. I was actually curious what -- I want to better understand the future upside in the amp business. Your portfolio has been fairly fixed for a long time. And you've done a pretty incredible job of increasing per caps over the last decade. Where does the real growth come from in the amphitheater business at this point? I have some follow-ups.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. Thanks, Brandon.
Michael Rapino: I'll start, and then you can go in there, Joe.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah.
Michael Rapino: Just let me step on that. I think Brandon you've heard us talk about it at our Venue Nation Day. We think we're in this double win right now. We think we have global scale that will still continue because of international markets and more to come. But we also have an incredible amount of opportunity to monetize the scale we have. And for the first 10 years, we built scale. We just kind of ran the scale. The last couple of years since COVID, we launched our Venue Nation division and really focused hiring up and bringing in new skill sets around hospitality, best-in-class food and beverage, best-in-class VIP clubs, et cetera. We think our amphitheaters are run very well. As I say, they're run very well like Southwest Airlines. They're very efficient, and they've been great machines to-date. But we think we're seeing when we invest capital on site, we're getting 20%, 30% returns on capital when we turn that grassy area into a VIP club, a membership club. You're going to see Jones Beach this summer. When you walk up to Jones Beach this summer, at an amphitheater, you're going to call me and go, now I get it. Now I see what these -- the machines could double their AOI when you start to really treat them as arenas have been doing a much better job about how do we upscale on site, elevate the experience and take over. So, we think the 50 amphitheaters we have, the bones of them are amazing. They do incredible job. They're efficient. We think we can double the business as we start to actually look inside the hood and upgrade on site, whether it's our Liquid Death idea that has been a huge surge in our food and beverage, our shaker cup, our own custom-branded liquor that we launched on site to our new clubs, we're rolling out to our VIP boxes, to our elevated. If you look at our overall amphitheater business, about 9% of it is premium. We think that should be 30% to 35%, to give you kind of macro numbers. If you doubled that overnight, your business would double in the long run. So just take your current house, upgrade it, double your capacity on a VIP business, and your business would double. That's the simplest way to look at it.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. And then the other half of it, Brandon, is that's making more on the shows from the fans that attend. In terms of the volume of shows, right now, with our current portfolio, if you assume typical amp has about four months of activity on average, our utilization rate is running about 35%. So, we still have a fair bit of space that we can put more shows into our amphitheaters. And while we haven't been growing by leaps and bounds, we are continuing to add an amp here, an amp there, on our hyper-local strategy of continuing to look for more spots that we can put an amphitheater in.
Brandon Ross: Great. Then over the past couple of years, I know Platinum has been a pretty big tailwind for probably both the Ticketmaster business and the Concert's business. And I was curious how far along you are in the rollout of Platinum ticketing, both in domestic and international? And then, how you expect Platinum to continue to contribute to the growth at both Concerts and Ticketmaster?
Michael Rapino: I'll start and Joe can jump in. Just think of Platinum as it's dynamic pricing, right? It's just pricing smarter. And that's been a skill that we've been -- we have a great in-house team who wakes up every day working with artists, agents, managers on this. And it may be as simple as just figuring out how to reprice. Tuesday night in Phoenix is worth different than a Saturday night in LA. So, being a lot smarter the way you can price your inventory, price the front better so the back sells out, price, et cetera. We think if you look at -- I'll give it two kind of ways to look at it. Outside of the US, we're in the first inning. So, we're just rolling this out around the world. So that's the great growth opportunity obviously. We have it in Europe, but still in infancy stages. We're going to expand it down to South America, Australia, et cetera. So, first inning on the international business, well received when it gets there. Promoters are anxious for it. Artists are anxious for it, because they see when they sell an arena in Baltimore versus Milan, right now, they look at the grosses and say, "Wow, we're leaving too much on the table for the scalpers. Let's price this better." So that's our best sales pitch. So, you're going to see that excel. And I would say on the US business, we're probably about in the fifth inning. The obvious stuff is done at the top end, some artists on kind of the P1 Platinum. But getting all the way through the business, amphitheaters, the B shows, the C, just dynamically pricing that better and smarter all along the way, we see it happen. It will increase your [take] (ph) flow and sell-through rate, all the way to the day -- time you open the gates up. So, we still think that's a multi-year opportunity to continue to grow our top-line/bottom-line.
Joe Berchtold: The other way I think about it, Brandon, is that the typical secondary ticket is still almost twice the price of a primary ticket. So, as Michael said, just think of Platinum as being the market priced ticket, artists are going to be more and more saying I want that through the house. I want that to be closer to really take away that scalper margin.
Brandon Ross: Yeah. And then, finally not to overstay my welcome here, but one thing I noticed, I've been, I think, covering your stock for many years now. And I've never seen you give the double-digit AOI expectation in Q4. It's always Q1 where you give that guidance. What gave you the confidence to give that type of guidance at this stage versus the usual Q1?
Joe Berchtold: I'll start. I think, first of all, our show pipeline is up double digits, very strong for -- driven by the arenas and amphitheaters as we've talked about. Michael gave all the reasons why we're highly confident in our ability to execute at our amphitheaters now. So, the volume of fans that we're confident in having and our ability to drive the profitability off of those fans gives us the visibility and confidence that we're going to deliver double-digit growth this year.
Brandon Ross: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: Hey, thank you. I guess first, Joe, wanted to see if you could provide some additional detail on the CapEx guide. Where are you deploying the growth capital, and what's driving the incremental spend, including for maintenance versus '23? And I know you've discussed potentially buying venues abroad. So, I don't know if you could say anything on the pipeline for deals and how that could potentially look relative to past years? And then just secondly, in November, you had described a DOJ investigation as in mid stages. So, I wanted to see if you had any update here in terms of timing or where things stand overall with the probe. Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Sure, let me start with the CapEx. As we noted, we're projecting right now about $540 million CapEx, two-thirds rev gen, one-third maintenance. If you look at the rev gen, about $300 million of that is either new venues or major renovations of existing buildings. And about half of that, about $150 million, is our top-four projects, would include major revamp of Foro Sol, which is the top international stadium in the world down in Mexico City. Michael talked about Jones Beach. Those projects would collectively have a return in the 20%s. So, we're definitely seeing some chunkiness now in some projects that cost tens of millions of dollars, happen to have several -- four of them line up this year that drives a lot of that. The other rev gen would be a combination of tactical things in existing venues, a new VIP club, a new viewing deck, rock boxes, some new bar designs that are extremely high returns, generally 40%s, 50%s-plus, sort of tactical improvements and some things at Ticketmaster heavily tied in with the sponsorship group and the creation of new ad units. And then maintenance is a combination mainly of venues, some Ticketmaster. I think that's continuing to rise at a rate lower than our revenue, lower than our ticket sales. So, we're watching that pretty closely and making sure we have that limited. In terms of the...
Michael Rapino: I think the venue pipeline...
Joe Berchtold: Yeah.
Michael Rapino: I'll just say, venue pipeline, I think we've been talking about it since our Investor Day. We're really happy about the Venue Nation team, our global development team. These were skills, really going into COVID, we didn't have in-house at any level. We're kind of best-in-class at this point. We've really scaled over the last three, four years, got incredible global teams working around the band. And we're just seeing, as we hope when we're walking into those RFPs that we weren't invited to, we're walking in and holding our own and winning right now some of the -- some key venues around the world that we'll be continuing to announce. So, we see it scaling over the next five years much, much higher than it was in the past just because we hadn't focused that much on international arenas before, and we see a great path forward on these.
Joe Berchtold: And then finally on DOJ. I don't think we've got a lot to report. We continue to answer any questions they have. They control the timing, and we'll watch it play out, but we don't have any specific updates.
David Karnovsky: Thank you.
Michael Rapino: We're 100% cooperative.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Thanks. Two, if I can. Michael, you've spoken in the past about kind of the current big shift in the promotion business being a move from kind of national booking and towards increasingly global booking. I'd love to hear just an update on where you think we are in that shift today? And then I thought it was interesting in the release that you're seeing all-in pricing lead to higher conversion. Is that something that you think can lead to adoption of third-party venues, or do you think that stays at your operated venue portfolio for now? Thanks, guys.
Michael Rapino: I'll answer. I mean, all-in pricing, I'll start. Yeah, we're actually surprised and thrilled because we were always skeptical, if we would be the one led path, there was any conversion that would hurt us. But I think consumers are loving the idea, they can see upfront. Ultimately they're shopping multiple tabs anyway. So, they're probably figuring out the true costs are the same. So yeah, we think it's a great test. I would say most of all the congressional, senate, all the stuff Joe and I are talking to everybody about, this just seems to be the common torch that everyone's running with. So, I would assume this ends up being legislated somewhere over time, and I would assume others are going to start jumping on the all-in wagon as a good step forward for consumers, so we can worry about the other issues around scalping, et cetera. On the promoter shift, it is a -- it's always the -- it's a three-level shift, right? It's a local promoter or a national promoter and a global promoter. Still lots of great local promoters, why we have 100 offices in 40 countries. Contracts still have to be executed local. So, you have to make sure you have the best local staff in market that can execute at scale on an ongoing basis. Artists have absolutely evolved over the last 10 years, much like they probably have one global record label and one global agent and one global publishing company, as touring became their most important category and expensive. These artists are putting on -- I was at the Drake show last night. I mean, he's -- it's an incredible show, he's carrying to those fans at a huge cost to give back. So, the artists are -- over the last 10 years have started to look for a much more national or global partner, whether it's us, AEG, CTS in Europe, because their needs have changed. They needed upfront capital. They needed organizations that have a wider view on data, marketing, sponsorship, ways to help them think about their global business. Do they go to Japan or not? Do they do Hong Kong before or after? Do we do Pacific Rim? What's the shipping costs? How do we get it all there? So, artists have become globalized brands and artist -- with the consumers, we've talked about. So, absolutely every artist -- the younger the manager and the younger the artist, the more global they're looking for. So, if you're kind of the new manager managing a superstar that's popped on a global basis, you absolutely want to sit down with someone and talk about your global touring plans and when do you go where before -- with one common agenda in mind. So, we're seeing that continual shift and I think you'll just see that continue to move over the next five years.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Interesting. Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citibank. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Bazinet: I just had a quick question on CapEx. You guys have been so consistent with this sort of 2%, 2.5% of revenues on CapEx. Given what's happening in your business and the high returns on invested capital we can see from the outside, why doesn't it make sense to sort of open up the envelope and spend a bit more?
Michael Rapino: Love this question. I think, as Joe and I talked about, coming out of COVID, the prior to last three years was obviously build back up that cash bank. We drained a lot during COVID, so we wanted to get the balance sheet strong again, get our staff, get everyone back in place, hire the skills we needed and plot through our real kind of five to 10-year strategy here. So, we think the way we're producing our AOI to cash flow return now, it's given us all the tools we need to deliver this ambitious growth plan that we laid out at our Investor Day. So, you'll see us move up and down depending if there is a big opportunity, but we've been pretty consistent that we can deliver our growth that we've outlined for you with that current number.
Joe Berchtold: And I think the market just accepts it more if we demonstrate it and then do it a bit more. As you said, we've been demonstrating that return on the invested capital. As we continue, we spend a bit more. We demonstrate those returns. The market will let us spend a bit more. The market doesn't tend to want you to take big leaps and big turns. So, we're not doing that. We're just steadily building a pipeline. And as the market sees the demonstrated returns, then you earn the right to continue to do more of it.
Jason Bazinet: Looking forward to the number being 3% or 3.5% of risk. Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ashton Welles with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Ashton Welles: Thank you for the question. It would be great to get an update on the real-time indicators you guys are seeing on the consumer front, whether that's the performance of on-sales or how shows are closing or on-site spending.
Michael Rapino: I'll start and then Joe can jump in. I mean, I see the ticket sale on my daily ticket sale counts. We just went on sale, jeez, within the last week on Usher, Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lopez, just announced Jelly Roll this morning. These shows are flying out the door from top to bottom. So yeah, we're seeing no slowdown on the consumer from -- I was in Columbus, Ohio for a sold-out Drake show last night. We had two nights in a row sold out, incredible high-merch numbers. They were buying all the sweatshirts and onsite the GM told me they were -- we're doing really strong numbers. So, we're seeing at our current business, they're buying and showing up across the country and across the globe right now.
Joe Berchtold: And we're seeing most of these on-sales still selling front-to-back, meaning most expensive tickets to least. So, we're seeing strong demand at all price points. We just went on sale with our lawn passes for our amphitheaters, up double digits in sale on that for the price-conscious fan. So that's going well. Shows are closing. We really have the best per-cap on-site spending right now at our theaters and clubs, just given that its Q1, those numbers continue to be strong and show year-on-year growth. So, all fronts are showing strong consumer demand globally.
Ashton Welles: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Katz: Hello, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about the different business lines, how would we think about the trajectory or arc of growth in Sponsorship relative to Concerts? And what I am essentially getting at is whether there is an acceleration of growth in sponsorship and advertising that is begotten from this outperformance and this -- this acceleration that you're seeing in -- on the concert side of things later on?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, David, this is Joe. I think absolutely there are increasing benefits to scale on the Sponsorship business. One of the things that the brands are telling us they're looking for is they want to reach customers at a time when they are open to the brands, which we have, but they want to make sure that it's at scale. That at-scale really matters. So, they're not trying to do a lot of different little programs. And so, we're seeing a lot more demand. We're over $1 billion in revenue on the Sponsorship side. We're 100 -- closing in on 150 million fans. So, we -- over 600 million tickets on Ticketmaster. So, we've now got a scale and that scale continues to beget more scale. So absolutely, we see a very strong continued growth in that business.
David Katz: So just to follow it up, and I'm not fishing for any kind of guidance or anything like that. But the growth rate in Sponsorship obviously could outgrow and grow more than potentially that of Concerts at some future day, right, if we're sort of plotting those lines?
Joe Berchtold: Well, I think if you look historically, look back since 2010, Concerts has consistently grown faster than our Sponsorship business, and we think it continues to be a strong double-digit growth business.
David Katz: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael Rapino for any closing comments.
Michael Rapino: Thank you. I appreciate all your support, and we'll talk to you at the end of Q1.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is John, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation’s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. And I would now like to turn the call over to Amy Yong, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Amy Yong: Good afternoon. And welcome to the Live Nation third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino; and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. We will start with prepared remarks from Michael and then we will take your questions. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that this afternoon’s call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company’s anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation’s SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation have provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release or website supplement, which also contains other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call. The release reconciliation and website supplement can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation’s website. And with that, I will now turn it over to our President and CEO, Michael Rapino.
Michael Rapino: Thank you for joining us. As you can see from our results, the structural tailwinds behind our business are accelerating faster than ever and as a fan demand truly globalizes and artist were able throw more broadly than ever, this is still in an unprecedented global desire for concerts. This is happening at all levels with both casual and diehard fans and from small clubs to massive stadium events. We will start the conversation today in the next week a deeper into our results how these trends are setting up the industry for ongoing growth. Joe, anything to add.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Only thing for me to add is that given the investor presentations next week we’ll keep today’s call more brief than usual. So, with that, I will -- I think, we’re ready to take questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Brandon Ross: Hey. Thanks. Just to start-off, since you guys last reported there’s been at least two major articles on the DOJ investigation into your company, as well as some movements in both the legislative and executive branches and industry-wide regulation. Can you just give us an update on what you know about the Justice investigation and then separately, the potential impact of the proposed Congressional legislation? Then I have a follow-up.
Joe Berchtold: Sure. Thanks, Brandon. I’ll start first of all just on the legislative, which I think is pretty straightforward. Right now there is an all-in pricing bill by Senators Cantwell and Cruz under consideration. We are fully supportive of there’s a BOTS Act that Senator Blackburn introduced, I mean, you call main, which we’re also fully supportive of, and in general, everything we’re hearing legislatively are things that I think are pretty consistent with what we outlined in the FAIR Ticketing Act and things that we would definitely be supportive of. On the DOJ and the article that came out yesterday. I think, not surprisingly, it’s our impression that the DOJ is taking at least the first level look at almost everything that our competitors complain about and from there they look further at some issues and not others and if they tell us they have a problem with something we talked to them about it. But, let me emphasize this, as far as we can tell nobody thinks that the fundamentals that drive our promotions business are unlawful. We pay top dollar to artists and provide them with top-notch tour support and those are good things. I think the article also seems to reinforce that the investigations looking at specific business practices versus our overall business model, which as I’ve said previously, is my impression-based on what I’ve heard. On the specifics, I mean, recall on the agencies getting document retention letters. I think generally anyone the DOJ’s six documents from gets the cover letter like this saying they should retain documents related to the investigation. So all this tells us is they think the agencies have relevant information, which seems pretty obvious given the topics that are being discussed and competitors complain about. Finally, we obviously find it interesting, as I think, you tweeted that the timing of this always seems to come up at earnings. We don’t think there’s any real news right now. Concerning the investigation, we’re completing our document production that they’ve asked for. We haven’t even started depositions and our impression is that the investigation is kind of in its mid-stages at this point. And yeah, we have another new story on the day before earnings which we don’t seem to think a coincidence.
Brandon Ross: Okay. And getting to the business, your forward-looking metrics and especially the Q3 ticketing results point to real continued strength for your business. But there’s a lot of trepidation now about consumer weakness, especially after some weak guidance from others in the experienced economy. I know Bookings just said, some negative things just now. Is there anything in real-time that you’re seeing at all to suggest fall-off in trends at Ticketmaster. I know like the arenas of the world will continue to sell, but are the Tuesday’s in Pittsburgh still holding up and like really especially for Ticketmaster, as you look forward?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. We’re seeing no issues. Let me give you that in the two piece. I think you asked about, first of all, Q3 and then call it October. So Q3 was very strong volume quarter. So it was really driven by ticket volume $90 million fee-bearing tickets that we sold in the quarter, which --and the growth came from both North America and internationally. So we’re seeing that the demand consistent globally. 90% of the growth came from Concerts, which again tells you that the fans are looking to go to the Concerts. The one thing, I would note on Q3 is just a reminder, the last year, we had an unusual concentration of client renewal expenses, which are normally spread out over the second half, but largely came together last year. But really the quarter was about the tremendous volume and tremendous fan demand that flowed through Ticketmaster. Looking then more specifically at just October. If we looked at our Ticketmaster platform for the month of October, ticket sales were again up year-on year relative to last year. They were up double digits in North America. So we’re seeing no sign of weaknesses. Another metric that we look at is as we look at just for our U.S. Concerts division we track every week, year-on year sales and again over the past five weeks since the end of the quarter, those sales continue to be up double digits. So we’re seeing no weakness at all. We gave you the leading indicators for show commitments for next year and we’ll get into a more, but feeling good about everything that we’re putting on-sale.
Brandon Ross: Thank you.
Michael Rapino: And Brandon just for more color. Yes.
Brandon Ross: Yeah.
Michael Rapino: I have weekly booking calls with over the 40 Presidents around the world. When we talk both from clubs to stadiums and festivals. And we have not seen anything taper off in any sense or on-sales for next year, whether it’s an early festival across the pond or was there, let’s say, a festival -- a club tour playing in Pittsburgh on a Tuesday, as you say, or maybe the blink-182 who toured last year, now is back on tour again this year playing Pittsburgh just to Cleveland on Wednesday and any pullback in any way from a club to a stadium tour from Malan to Argentina right now. The consumer supply-demand seems to be consistent across the globe small to big.
Brandon Ross: Thanks very much.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you. Joe, there has been a lot of focus on how the Concert segment profitability would shake out this quarter and just given the mix shift towards stadium shows in the slate this year and maybe offsetting that some dynamics around having a more matched revenue and expense structure compared to last year. I was hoping you could help us unpack some of those dynamics and maybe size some of those factors. Just as we think about Concerts profitability this quarter, I think, it would be helpful to contextualize this year and then look forward to next year?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. I think, let me start by just noting that, year-to-date our Concert margins are up year-on year and for the full year, I expect margin expansion of at least 50 basis points relative to last year, so making good progress verging on halfway back towards the 2019 levels and that’s despite growth for the overall year that will be definitely skewed to third-party venues driven heavily by stadiums. If we look at the quarter. I think if we look at Q3, about 47% of our fans were in arenas or stadiums, which is pretty good proxy for third-party buildings. The comparable last year for that number was 42%. So we had a lot more fans mix in arenas or stadiums this year. Those two buildings accounted for about 75% of the 7.5 million fans that we added in the quarter. And that does two things, as we’ve talked about in the past. It drives our AOI up, because we’re making money on these fans and negatively impacts margins. So that’s why you’ll see the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. We don’t worry a lot about, but I think, if you take the overall combination of high growth and third-party buildings shifts the mix towards more third-party buildings and make substantial progress in our margins for the full year, I think we’re pretty happy as we look at the totality of that.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe one for Michael. You’re coming up on lapping the launch of two fairly significant tours in Taylor Swift and Beyonce. I think there’s some concern that those tours will be hard to replicate as we look ahead to next year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how impactful these tours worry to your business this current year and maybe looking ahead how the slate for 2024 is shaping up and you sort of the opportunity to compensate for some of the notable tours year-over-year? Thank you.
Michael Rapino: Yeah. Thank you. Well, I’m sorry, I’ve seen this written, but we didn’t promote the Taylor tour. So I don’t have that comparable to worry about in 2024. Beyonce was our tour wildly successful. But when we look at any artist across Ticketmaster Live Nation, no artists is going to account for more than 1% of the tickets. So no one tour will ever hurt us year-over-year, it’s about our macro portfolio of artists and tours. And we have a very good pipe as we’ve been saying for next year. We think next year -- crazy to say, but sitting here looking at this year that we’re looking at double-digit growth over this year, next year on ticket sales and our stadiums are gaining a lot of steam. So we’re very confident. We’re going to have big record-breaking tours on the road next year as Bad Bunny just went up again and more to come announced -- more to be announced. So we are very confident that well Ticketmaster Live Nation are going to have big strong years next year with a pipe full that we will overcome this year’s numbers.
Stephen Laszczyk: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: Hey. Thank you. Maybe following-up on ticketing. It looks like your revenue growth well outpaced GTV growth, so interested to understand how non-service fee revenue might have helped in the quarter? And then, Michael, I don’t know if you can say anything on the Mastercard agreement to today -- from today and I don’t know, what other opportunities you see for sponsorship deals to kind of cover your international footprint?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. Sure. I’ll start just on the ticketing. Absolutely, Ticketmaster continues to benefit from the non-service fee revenue sources it has. On the upsells and other services that itself to fans, as well as increasing array of services that it’s providing to venues and promoters are all good sources that are helping us increase the profitability per ticket that we’re selling.
Michael Rapino: And Mastercard, we’re thrilled to have him onboard. We’ve been working over the last couple of years to have a great diversity across our partners on the payment side. Thankfully, we didn’t take any of the easy crypto money at the time. We worked hard to make sure we had a stable of great partners. Today looking at Citibank, PayPal and now Mastercard for international rounds out our global portfolio in that category at an overall economics surpassing we historically had. So very, very happy to have them onboard, big part of our business and continue to show strong growth in our sponsorship side and sponsors lined-up to be part of this Live boom.
David Karnovsky: Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ashton Welles with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Ashton Welles: Thank you. I think you guys are on track to add 6 million fans or so this year at your owned and operated venues. Is this sort of the right run rate to think about going forward or could this step up in coming years?
Joe Berchtold: This is an area that we’re absolutely focused on continuing to add venues. So the hope is that we continue to build on that number. I think it will probably not be linear year-to-year as we add to our portfolio, but it’s an area that we’re very focused on building as that tends to be our highest profit, highest margin fan that we serve.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Joyce with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question.
David Joyce: Thank you. A couple of related questions, the ticketing revenue particularly blew away our estimate. So I was wondering how much of that is for 2023 events and how much for 2024, and then similarly with deferred revenue being up 39%. I know that some of that is due to the function of when the shows go on sales. That’s not an indicator of what the revenue growth would be. But how much of that would be due to venue mix or the tour type for 2023 shows versus 2024. In other words, how do we use these metrics on an apples-to-apples basis to help with our outlook for 2024? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Sure. So, first of all, at this point, through Q3, we’ve not sold a ton of tickets for 2024. That’s why we focus more on what the show bookings are. So we have sold -- and we sold more tickets this year, which is part of what goes into the deferred revenue, I will come back to you. But we’ve sold on the order of I think 18 million tickets for shows next year. So relatively small portion of what we’re ultimately sell. So that’s not the driver of our Ticketmaster results for Q3. To a very great extent, it’s more of the other factors that I talked about. And then, deferred revenue is up, because, yes, we have sold more tickets for the shows next year. We’ve also sold more tickets for the shows that are occurring in Q4 and it’s our expectation that because of that pipeline and because as Michael noted, it’s turned into a pretty solid period for stadiums, as well as arenas. We expect to see that deferred revenue number continuing to grow for the next seven months, eight months.
David Joyce: Understood. I appreciate it.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael for any closing comments.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everyone. We look forward to seeing you in New York next week, we’re excited about where we are as an industry and we look-forward to taking you through details next Thursday. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 05:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is John, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining us today from Live Nation, our President and CEO; Michael Rapino, President and CFO, Joe Berchtold, and Head of Investor Relations, Amy Yong. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Berchtold. Thank you. Mr. Berchtold, you may begin your conference.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, everyone, for joining us. As I think you noticed from our earnings release this time based on some feedback that we've gotten on our release and the materials in general. We've switched it up this time to get a little more comprehensive and data-driven in terms of numbers and the facts. So you see an earnings release that we reduced the narrative and increase, if I give you on a more structured basis all the key numbers and then also put a trending schedule that I think there was a link to you can get as a PDF or an Excel file, so you can track this quarter's numbers relative to history to make some of it easier. So I'll turn it over to Amy to give you a quick reminders, and then Michael and I will go straight into taking questions that folks have. Amy?
Amy Yong: Thanks, Joe. We would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to our SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. We will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, we have provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release issued earlier today. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on our website. And with that, we are now ready to take questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your questions.
Brandon Ross: I think investor concern now, if you were to pull the buy side is that with the past few years coming out of COVID being so strong, you're going to have trouble growing next year. And I think the Street is only at mid- to high single-digit growth. I guess, this is a good problem to have, but you said there are positive indications for '24, and wanted to see if you can kind of break that down into domestic and international. So on the domestic side, what are the positive indications that you're seeing besides this very early pipeline? Will supply match what we've seen in the past couple of years. And then on international, obviously, LatAm has been a huge tailwind post-acquisition. You've seen some other green shoots in Asia and parts of Europe. Should we expect continued growth in those markets or just more M&A on top?
Joe Berchtold: So Brandon, thanks. This is Joe. For starters, as I think you probably noticed we put in the release that at this point, our confirmed shows and shows that we have offers in on our arenas, amphitheaters, stadium shows is up relative to where we are at this point last year coming into '23. So we're seeing continued growth in the show count, which should lead to continued growth in attendance. As you know, our formula is to drive that growth in attendance and from there, accelerate the AOI levels even higher with increasing per fan profitability on-site, increasing sponsorship, increasing our ticketing business. So I think we're set up for a very strong continued growth into 2024 across the board. And a lot of that activity, these are going to be the shows that have the longest lead time on. So a lot of these are going to be global in nature, cutting across both North America and international. As you noted and as I think much of the release lays out, this has been a tremendous quarter for growth in international markets up, I think it was 46% fan growth so far this year, which given that we were closed part of last year, we expected to see very strong growth. But we still think we're in the early innings. If you take Latin America, we're up about 35% this year so far year-to-date with roughly 10 million fans. But we think we're still in the early innings in South America. We launched the Town festival already sold 400,000 tickets on our way to probably 500,000 tickets, which is unheard of for a festival in its first year. So as we continue to layer on our promoting business bringing in our sponsorship business, bringing in our ticketing business throughout Latin America. That just continues to drive it forward. In North America, again, a very good year this year, and we're seeing the sort of growth that we think is possible ongoing year-to-date, up 8% in North America with the fan count expect that to be double-digit fan growth in Q3, probably verging on double-digit fan growth for the full year in North America as we're seeing top to bottom. We're seeing strong growth in theaters and clubs. Our amphitheaters are doing great, substantially up in number of fans attending per show and the high-end stadiums are doing very well. I've seen some things talking about is the middle, how is the low end demand across all of those continues to be very strong.
Michael Rapino: And I'll just jump in. And Brandon, just to reiterate the pipe, right? The most important thing for us is just how does the pipe look for next year. As you know, a year ago, we sat here, and I think everyone thought '22 was the record year, and we were headed into an air pocket, and we've blown the doors off in '23. I would just step back. We believe for the next multiple years that this industry, in general, is going to have a growth surge on a global basis. We've talked to all these factors before, international, global artists, consumers. There's a whole bunch of great articles written on why there's a boom happened in a live business on a long-term basis. So we don't think this is just any COVID catch-up. We think that this is going to be the time we're live on a global basis is going to have an incredible growth run for years to come. We obviously benefit from that any time the market gets this level of growth because we'll capture that growth also. So we're looking next year, we're seeing top to bottom, as Joe said, incredible pipe of artists that will be filling all of the different venue types and markets across the world. So we think we're heading to a very, very strong 24, 25 onward, a combination of the market is going to grow, the consumer demand is growing and our ongoing bolt-on acquisitions, venues, new market entries compounded on top of our organic growth is going to give us this continual 1, 2 punch of growth for the next multiple years.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: Just maybe on the outlook for consumer spending. There's been a lot made over the last couple of months about the impact of student loan payments starting up in the fall. Maybe for Joe, if you could just remind us what percentage of the comps are going based you think might be skewed toward this cohort? And then maybe more broadly discuss how you're thinking about the risk that consumer spending pulls back maybe into the back half of the year or next year? Are there any parts of your business that you think are more or less exposed and perhaps festivals, and just would be curious if you could dive a little bit more deeply into the demands under the equation.
Joe Berchtold: Sure, Stephen. Thanks. I think first, just for context, I think it's important to remember a relative scale. So if you look at consumer spend, discretionary spend on goods versus experiences. As we know, it was in the high 60s in experience. I mean this is a Goldman report that talks about this. pre-pandemic and then how that has dropped and it hasn't yet caught up. So our analysis shows that the tailwind impact from getting experiences back as a portion of discretionary spend is about 10x the impact of any potential headwind coming from the student loan payments needing to get made. So we think that the tailwinds on that specific macro factor as far outweighs any headwinds. As Michael talked on a global basis, we continue to see this as a tremendous tailwind business as you have further and further globalization of demand. As we look at all the different pockets, as I mentioned earlier that the amphitheaters is an example of a mid-level act. We're seeing high single-digit increases in attendance per show, which is really driven by more lawn tickets being sold. So the people that you might say are going to be the most price conscious are continuing to spend strongly per caps growing even as we're continuing to increase our number of fans per show, which again means that even the marginal fan is continuing to spend a lot when they show up. So we're not seeing any indicators that would give us any concern on any slowdowns.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. Thanks for that. And maybe just one on Concert segment margins. It looks like ALM margins were up year-over-year in the second quarter. I think there might have been some assumptions that margins would be pressured year-over-year just given the mix of the slate towards stadium and arena this year. So I'm curious what drove margin expansion in the quarter? And if you think this is a trend that will be sustainable for the rest of the year? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. As we said in the last quarter, our expectation for the full year on concerts is that you will see margin expansion relative to last year. You're correct that any fan in third-party buildings is generally going to be a lower margin than fans in our building. But the countervailing factors is that we continue to increase the per-fan profitability across all of the different venue types. So as we increase that per fan profitability through all the different ways that we have to monetize, then we're going to see some margin expansion. That comes from increased per caps on our own building, it also comes from continuing to focus on the costs. I think in particular, in North America, we've been very effective. We look at our amphitheaters, if we look at our theaters and clubs globally, we've been able to actually drive down our average operating cost per fan this year relative to last year, which certainly helps with our margins.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: I'm curious with your voluntary all-in pricing initiative, I know you haven't implemented this yet. But curious what the reception has been so far from fans, clients, lawmakers. And then, can you discuss, have you thought about any potential demand impact as or for the shows that your venues as I think now optically at least you're raising prices relative to maybe competing locations? And then maybe for third-party venues that would opt-in, how you would think about the demand impact there? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Sure. I think the general reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. People understand that getting the all-in price upfront is absolutely the best consumer experience. I think there is a lot of concern that there will be still confusion in the marketplace because there will be a mix of all-in pricing for shows on our sites and on the primary tickets on our sites and you go to secondary sites, you'll see a different approach. So that's why we continue to support legislation that drives a consistent fan experience. Because we are the primary ticketing provider in these events, I think it's our expectation in general that even that all-in primary price is generally going to still be lower than any secondary price even without service fees. So our experience thus far in New York or Louisiana that's recently implemented it, we haven't seen any impact on our primary ticket sales.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And then, Joe, for the $300 million of growth CapEx, I wanted to see if you could provide any additional color around that? How would you bucket that between concerts and ticketing and then within concerts, new builds or other growth initiatives? And then your release noted international locations, specifically for the Venue Nation pipeline. I'm interested, you now kind of see international is the key area where you're going to be adding venues?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. I think if you look at the overall $300 million of spend is vast majority of it would be concept-driven, 75%, 80% of it would be on the concert side. If you look then on the concert side, I would put it in 3 buckets. One is where we're doing a lot of tactical improvements across a broad set of our amphitheaters or theaters and clubs around revenue-generating opportunities, putting in new bar designs, putting in additional points of sale, things that are going to tactically help drive our APF levels. Second is, when we renew our amphitheaters or our theaters and clubs, we often go through a CapEx refresh cycle, that because we're going to have a long-term lease, we're going to be able to get a strong return off of that investment. And then, third would be the new builds where whatever level generally coming in and building out the shell and taking on that building would be the third bucket. And it's going to move around year-to-year within those 3, but those would be the 3 large buckets. And then in terms of the priorities, absolutely, international, Latin America, Asia and more in Europe is highest priority for the Venue Nation strategy. In the U.S., you benefit from having a strong arena infrastructure because NBA, NHL, their teams and their affiliate teams provide you with some of that infrastructure that you don't tend to have in the rest of the world. So this lets us both benefit from strongly attractive returns on those venues also, let's just put on more shows for more fans, because we're putting an infrastructure in place that didn't previously exist.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Glagola: Joe, you're on track for $300 million fee bearing tickets this year which is 7% growth over 22. IN the first half ticket growth on fee bearing is 22% year-over-year. So just maybe help us understand what's the slowdown in the second half in ticketing or is that just some conservatism in the numbers. And then I have one more follow-up. Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I think it's just -- you don't yet know what Q4 looks like in terms of timing with on sales for shows next year. So I think we're confident in the $300 million number at this point with the visibility we have. When we're sitting here talking next. I think we'll have better visibility into what Q4 is and we'll guide from there.
Stephen Glagola: Okay. Thank you. And then similarly on the ticketing margin side, you came in north of 40% again in Q2. You're reiterating high 30s in the back half -- for the full year, excuse me, implies sort of like a mid-30% margin in the back half. But just similar to the revenue line, what's going on there sequentially and the puts and takes. Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I think is a long talk. There's a lot of timing that happens with us in a given quarter. I think you saw last year a lot of the same questions. We had lower margins in the second half as we had a lot of costs associated with contract renewal cycles and other factors. So I think at this point, we're comfortable continuing to reiterate the high 30s for the margin, but not yet ready to get more specific than that.
Stephen Glagola: Okay. And should we expect contract renewals again for Q3, similar to last year?
Joe Berchtold: I don't think we're looking to guide in a specific margin for a specific quarter as much as just give the overall year guidance.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Supino: Question on international with it growing so strongly, more major tourist -- artists touring globally. Has your strategy changed at all? Does this fact invite you to spend more money perhaps on international M&A? Are there other things that you can do now with higher visibility to international demand that you might not have done in the past? And a second shorter question just is on technology. There's all the controversy around bots and scalpers over the last year indicate that the company could productively spend materially more on technology and solve some of those problems? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: On the global part, Joe -- I don't think the strategy has changed. I think if you've listened to us for the last 5 years, or longer. We've been talking about that live as a global business, the artist has been unlocked globally. Consumers, thanks to social media and others are driving global consumption with no gatekeepers. So we have 100 offices in over 40 countries. We have been on this march for a long time. And we think there's still lots of opportunity, obviously, as we talked about in Latin America, Pacific Rim, Eastern Europe. But kind of plan is following as we kind of predicted the artists would continue to go global -- more global artists and international markets would want to be just like New York and Boston would want to be hosting U2 and Beyonce’s of the world, so we had an opportunity to build out those markets. So pedal down, we see lots of great growth opportunity for years to come on that front.
Joe Berchtold: And on the bots, certainly, new technologies allow us to continue to get more sophisticated in trying to stop the bots. We're regularly working on both the technologies as well as just new processes to try to weed out humans versus bots. Problem is some of the same technologies is also being deployed by the bad actors trying to jump the line and get those they have a $5 billion a year incentive to cheat get those tickets, which is why we've been continuing to advocate and I think we've seen a lot more visibility on some of the behavior that we need or we'd like at least more legislative support in terms of real punishments for the bad actors or the platforms that enable the bad actors, ending practices like speculative ticketing that is clearly price manipulative and anti-consumer. So we're continuing to do our part to fight it, and we hope that we'll be able to get some help with some rules and with some real penalties for people that are trying to cheat.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Katz: I wanted to just get an update, if you don't mind, on the digital process, right, digital ticketing, et cetera, and then the second derivative of being able to harvest and drive better returns off of the information gathered from it. So where is that today and where can it go? And how do you see that opportunity?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. At this point, digital ticketing is largely ubiquitous globally coming out of COVID. I haven't seen the latest numbers, but I expect it to be the 90s that are now digital tickets. It's a very informed shifting from barcodes to what we call safe ticks, which is rotating barcodes or NFC keep tickets from being counterfeited and sold over and over. So we have a number of initiatives that have launched them to use that data. We've talked extensively about some of the things we've done in marketing, bringing all of our data together to better understand the fan, how we market to that fan. How with the digital connection, we're able to market to them on behalf of our Digimaster clients, how we're able to market to them on behalf of sponsors, how we're able to send them messages for upsells when they go to shows in our buildings. So that all continues. And then in the background, we have Ticketmaster using the data that it gets for a range of, I'll call it, machine learning purposes and tools in terms of helping clients figure out how do they price their shows, how they market their shows, what are the tools that they should use can help our concert folks in terms of understanding likely demand for tours and shows in specific markets. So certainly, now it's the point where that data and now is used is permeated the business.
David Katz: Got it. And if I can follow up, please. With respect to Platinum, right, we do have discussions about inflation and the cost of things, et cetera, et cetera, which doesn't seem to be at play here. But where is that? Where can it grow? And any pressure points with respect other than the artists themselves authorizing it, right? Any pressure points toward sort of growth in Platinum and how that mixes you higher?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I want to have characterized it as artists not allowing it. I mean the artists are the ones who are set the price of their tickets. It's our job to provide the information to them to help them understand the market value of their tickets, so they can figure out the balance that's right for them and their fan base in terms of pricing the tickets. So they're getting the value. Are they giving it to the fans, how do they keep it from going to the scalper. A lot of artists now I would say it's almost becoming the standard that they're understanding they should price the front of their house to capture most of the value. Otherwise, it's the scalper who's going to take it. And then they want to make sure the back of the house is priced so that every fan can afford to buy a ticket can get in. The trend we've seen coming out of COVID is, I think, a switch from it being partially used to being very ubiquitous here in North America. And then over the past year or so is becoming much more heavily adopted in international markets. I think we still have a long ways to go in international markets towards full adoption. And if you look at the pricing with platinum, there's still a substantial gap relative to average secondary pricing which would imply that artists are continuing or attempting to give a lot of the value to fans and we'll see how that evolves over time.
Michael Rapino: Just to jump in on Platinum. The magic of Platinum isn't to increase the first rows. The magic of Platinum is it gives that artist the opportunity to look at the whole house. We have never, and historically jumped on an earnings call and told you we couldn't sell the first 10 rows out. Our job is always to sell the last 10 rows out in the upper nosebleeds as they call them. So what platinum has enabled the industry to do is as the artist has increased show cost and needs to get a certain gross for that night is we should figure out how to maximize some of the front of the house closer to market, but that's also let us bring the price down in the back end of the house. So the net gross can be more overall, but it's giving fans a better sell-through rate on the back end of the house. We used to be locked into kind of 3 ticket prices that didn't have that opportunity. So the biggest advantage to dynamic pricing and platinum price over the last few years was really just how do you help the whole house gets sold? How do you reduce the prices in the back end of the house? But are always the harder ones to sell so you truly get a full house on the proper gross for the artist and then all of us benefit when more people walk through those doors.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Bazinet: I just had a question on the secondary market. And my question is pretty simple. Is your philosophy or emphasis on this market changed? Because I think in your K, you talked about the GTV on secondary being something like almost $4.5 billion in 22 more than double 19 levels in this release, you're talking about secondary ticketing volumes up double digits. So is this just indicative of the overall strength that we're seeing in consumer interest and going to live events? Or is it something that you're doing as well or both?
Joe Berchtold: Well, first off, again, just to keep it in context, we've long said that, first and foremost, our job is to sell the primary ticket. We're a primary ticketing company and its secondary is a kind of low to mid-teens portion of our GTV. So it's relevant, but it's also not the primary focus. We have long thought that we need to be in secondary because fans have a need to buy a ticket. And when a show is sold out if we're not giving them an option to buy a legitimate secondary ticket, then we're forcing them to go to other platforms to buy their tickets, and we think they're better off being served within the Ticketmaster ecosystem. I think as we continue to do a better job with our offer, reducing friction, understanding how to deliver on the fan needs as we've aligned with the NFL, the NBA and others on the sports side have a slightly different model for secondary. I think we've naturally grown our position in the market. But what really matters to us, first and foremost, is that we have a great primary sale, and that's managed in a way that is going to keep content happy.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Paul Golding with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Golding: Congrats on the quarter. I just quickly wanted to see if you had an update on a metric you've given before in terms of the average ticket price and how that's been trending? I think in the past, you've said it's been below $35. And then, secondly, as a follow-up, as we watch sort of the macro tightening in the backdrop and not so much for your business. But in general, in tracking sponsorship, any color you could give on cohorts that are more or less meaningful for that sponsorship growth that you've been seeing as we track forward into this tightening environment. Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: So first of all, on the average ticket price, I think what we've talked in the past is that the average -- the entry ticket price, so the lowest price that a fan can find a ticket at for our amphitheaters, for theaters and clubs is generally average below $35. And for the reasons that Michael spoke to, it continues to be below $35 because the artists are wanting to make sure that almost all fans can get in to see their show. And then what you've seen is because their costs have gone up because they've seen what's going on in the secondary market, some of the closer in parts of the house or have increased ticket pricing. I mean, you can see from the overall Ticketmaster, GTV and number of tickets sold that pricing in total is up double digits still year-on-year while the entry prices remain low. On the sponsorship, I'm not sure I fully understood your question. I think we've seen no slowdown in terms of our sponsorship business. We have over 90% of our expected revenue for the year is booked being driven by a lot of the large multi-asset, multimillion dollar sponsors that we work with who have long-term agreements with us that continue to go very well and continue to sign more.
Paul Golding: I guess my question around that was more around sector. So for example, if we were to think about sports and sports betting maybe being a predominant sponsor, boost this year or at the tail end of last year. Anything in that type of area of color around the mix.
Michael Rapino: We have 900 different sponsor brands. Every category you can imagine is fairly distributed evenly. So we haven't seen any sector pullback that has affected any of the core business overall. We've always said, we believe that our business is a -- it is a much less of an investment than a lot of the other TV and big campaign investments that brands make, it's a much more targeted approach. So we've seen more brands shift some of their dollars from the other categories to the event space where they can kind of get that direct consumer interaction that they can't maybe get on digital and elsewhere. So we've seen most sectors increase their spend in our category. It's been growing, and we've been growing with it. We think that trend is going to stay because as they're all trying to figure out how to connect with consumers in a digital world, we in sports live, give them that one opportunity to hit consumers at scale on a Thursday in Pittsburgh. So we think we're going to see more growth in our category.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansoon-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: Two, if I can. The increase in accretion expectations for the year that you call in the release connected with OCESA, imply that the performance there is pacing pretty well above your expectations earlier in the year. Can you talk a little bit about what specifically has been outperforming with OCESA? And then more generally, in terms of Latin America, it's obviously been a focus for you guys. Do you feel like now with kind of touch points in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, that you're in a position where you can kind of expand to the rest of that region organically? Or are there other kind of individual markets where it might make more sense to penetrate through M&A? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: We think the -- kind of our global playbook has always been the same. We enter most of these markets, low cost, maybe a bolt-on promoter or festival. We end up having enough content that we can bring the tour to the market, and then we build up the flywheel once we get to that market. So in Brazil, we've got Rock In Rio, an incredible festival foundation. We now have a great touring business there, bringing artists to the ground. We've launched our sponsorship business there, and now we've just launched ticketing there. So I think it's a great combination. We'll see a continual growth in Latin America, Brazil, a big year and Argentina is crazy as the market is on ticket sales. We like the entire market down there. So you'll see us organically grow. We've always been a predominantly organic-driven business and then we'll use continual bolt-ons to keep powering and doubling up on our efforts there.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: How about on OCESA and what's driven that outperformance?
Joe Berchtold: I mean that spend across the board. I think on their concert side, we've done well in terms of starting to get shows on our dream platform down to Mexico. Latin artists are clearly on fire. So they've got very, very strong set of regional shows they've been doing. Their festival business is doing great. We've worked with them to get the ticketing platform enhanced and that's continuing to perform very well, and they've been bringing in sponsors. So it's really across all elements of their business, I would say, has well outperformed relative to what we thought when we acquired them or even when we thought 6 months ago, 9 months ago or now this year would be.
Michael Rapino: Remember, we bought OCESA in COVID. We believe in the market, did we model out our IRR to think that the industry would bounce back as big as it has, no. So anything we're doing down there has been above and beyond what we expected for Latin market and industry in general overall. And we've got an incredible management team down their partnership with the CEO. They're very, very well-run organization. They've got venues, ticketing we've been able to take a really kind of archaic ticketing platform and continually reinvent it now that we're partners on the Ticketmaster side, sponsorship upgrades. So off their incredible base, our expertise and the market dynamics. It's been an incredible return.
Cameron Mansson-Perrone: If I can follow up quickly on one of those points. Is that generally a one-way bringing sponsors from elsewhere into those new markets? Or is there also kind of a reverse dynamic where you're taking local sponsors and also giving them exposure in North America, Europe that they may not have had previously?
Michael Rapino: Yes. I don't want to say it's completely one way, but it's our global sponsorship partnership team. When you're sitting with any of these big brands you can imagine and you're trying to sell a global sponsorship that maybe they're only doing with the Olympics and F1 because there's not a lot of global properties, right, the NBA, most sports is regional. So when we can sit in that room, they know we have a big office and in a now market in Brazil, and we can get you to Rio, Sao Paulo and Mexico City and Milan. So the more major markets we can add to our pitch when we're sitting with that CEO, CMO on a global basis, it helps look at our spot ship business that we can now deliver kind of a global platform and bring bigger sponsors to some maybe local deals they had. So we'll always kind of look to replace a local deal with the global deal would be the return we look for. So adding Latin, adding Mexico City out in these markets, big markets for most big brands gives us more markets to sell our global story too.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Harrigan: Down to some fairly down in the [indiscernible]. You did an acquisition in March, Clockenflap in Hong Kong, a great name, by the way. Is that any sort of real expansion platform, and you did put out a release on it. Obviously, that market has -- it’s still early to say the least, but is that a potential growth vector for you? And then, secondly, I guess off Peter's question earlier, some of the issues with [indiscernible] in November weren't so much that the pass could get through Verified Fan is that your network basically couldn't handle the amount of traffic that was generated. Do you feel like you've made sufficient upgrades at this point that if you have the same situation and not going to be another immediate areas too, but if there was, do you think you'd be able to scale appropriately so you didn't have the level of discount to customers? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: Let me take the second one first. This is Joe. Just to be very specific, what happened was there were two vectors of attack during that on-sale. One was a very large number of bots trying to crash into our verified fan system. That slowed down the fan experience, but that did not crash the system, or it could cause it to stop. At the same time, we had what was in effect the attempted cyber hack that was a brute force cyber-attack that had the fact of a dial service attack, not through our front door of our Verified Fan system, but through a specific surfer that we have. In order to fight off that cyber-attack, we had to stop the on-sale. Within 5 hours, we had figured it out how to fully reinforce the defenses to and in fact, move out the defense line so that stopping the cyber-attack. We know the attempted cyber-attack, we no longer have any load on our system for the verified fan experience, we started it back up. So the answer to your question is within 5 hours, we had solved that problem. It's not something that's taken us 6 months or 9 months to figure out how to solve. So we solved it quickly. We ultimately did sell 2 million tickets that day. And once those 5 hours were passed, while it was a long wait at times for fans because there were a lot of people trying to buy the tickets, there were not the system overload issues. I'll let Michael speak to it.
Michael Rapino: Yes. You're deeper in the [indiscernible]. What the acquisition were you referring to? Which one?
Matthew Harrigan: Clockenflap in Hong Kong, festival. I knew it was small, it got a little bit of a test in the trade meeting and you did put out the press release. I assume it obviously isn't that much of an expansion platform, but if you have any specifics on your ability to do anything on that market and expand more in Asia, outside of Australia and Japan, I thought that would be interesting. Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: I would say it was part of a broad bolt-on strategy in Asia. As Michael said earlier, we'll go in and we'll look for local promoters, local festivals that we can bring on and then we can then tie in with our broader concerts platform, bring our sponsorship team into. So it was an example, I would say, of the type of activity or type of M&A that we're doing in the region.
Michael Rapino: Just to jump on for others. I mean, we talked about Latin America, but Pacific Rim and others are equally important. It's a global business. So Japan, a real, real important market for us. Latin America, I mean, Pacific Rim in general, we're already in most of markets in some form have offices in Singapore. We've had a very successful operation in Korea, which has been kind of the foundation on why we ended up being the promoter for PTS and other [cape of] [ph] artists throughout the world. So we look at Pacific Rim equally as important is Latin America, you'll continually see us with a bolt-on promoter Venue festival as we're building up that business and driving content there also. Operator Thank you, everyone. This marks the end of the question-and-answer session, and this also concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.

Michael Rapino : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 2023 is off to a tremendous start. For the first time in 3 years, all of our markets are fully open. In the common theme, we are seeing around the world that live experiences are a high priority for fans. In Q1, we delivered record results across all divisions as well as record support for artists. Ticket sales to attendance and on-site spend, every sign points to incredible demand for live events. In the first quarter, were 19 million fans attended our shows across 45 countries and we sold over 145 million tickets with record levels of activity across all markets. We delivered revenue of $3.1 billion and AOI of $320 million, up 73% and 53%, respectively, relative to Q1 last year. In general, all my comments will be relative to Q1 last year. This performance is indicative of a continued long-term growth and set the stage for a record 2023 as we are more positive than ever about artists touring bands attending concerts to see their favorite artists and our role helping make this happen. But as clear as we look at our results and operating metrics is that global demand for live events continues to reach new heights. Demand has been growing for a long time and is showing no signs of letting up. Talking to fans, they say that live experiences are the #1 leisure activity where they expect to spend more in the future. Naturally, this is leading to record levels of activity in both our concerts and ticketing business. First in concerts, we sold nearly 90 million tickets for shows this year, tracking more than 20% ahead of this point last year. These are early sales and have been driven by a record number of stadium shows and continued strong growth in arena tours. With many major tours from Beyonce, Drake to Bruce Springsteen, demand has been so strong that even when artists add a number of additional shows, they still aren't able to meet all of the fan demand. As a further initiative to make ticket affordable to all fans, we launched today our Summer Concert Week, with $25 tickets available to nearly 4,000 shows. When fans attend shows they continue spending to enhance the experience. While our key outdoor season has not yet started, early reads from U.S. and European indoor venues that we operate demonstrate further growth in average per fan revenue. As we provide more elevated hospitality options for fans, we have launched Vibee which hosts destination events centered around live music and launched this week with the sale of the U2 Sphere VIP packages selling out. We've also continued building our Venue Nation portfolio with new venues expected to host nearly 3 million fans at 1,000 shows this year, driving long-term growth and profitability across all our businesses. Our ticketing business benefits from the same structural tailwind as concerts with further growth driven by our success in adding new clients, notably in international markets. As a result, we sold 73 million fee-bearing tickets in the first quarter, up 40% and delivered $7.7 billion in fee-bearing GTV, up 60%. We are seeing growth in both volume and pricing across our global markets. This holds true across all event types from sports to concerts and from biggest superstars to new artists. Our brand partners recognize the passion for live music has never been greater, and the Live Nation provides a unique on-site and online platform to connect with fans in meaningful ways on a global scale. And in the first quarter, we continued adding partners for 2023 and beyond, including Google Pixel, PayPal and Levi's. With this, we have commitments for over 80% of our planned sponsorship of the year.  Equally important, fans are embracing the value brands can provide to the concert experience, with around 70% of live music goers agreeing that brands can enhance their time at the show. Our team is the best in the industry at working with brands to develop programs that deliver value to fans, which in turn grows our brand relationships and attracts new ones.  Our results for the first quarter demonstrate the success of our strategy and sets us up for strong growth in 2023. We expect to host a record number of fans this year, even against a 2022 comparison which benefited from rescheduled shows attended by 20 million fans. Ticketmaster should also deliver record activity, with around 600 million tickets managed globally this year. Our sponsorship business, even after incredible growth last year, looks to be on track for double-digit AOI growth again this year. As we then look to 2024 and beyond, we have all the necessary levers to build our flywheel globally and continue to compound AOI by double-digits for the foreseeable future. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more details.
Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on 2022, we started out this year with a record Q1, our highest first quarter revenue, AOI, fan count and ticket sales. All of our markets are fully open, selling tickets, hosting tours and connecting brands with fans. Our reported revenue of $3.1 billion for the quarter was $1.3 billion better than Q1 2022, an increase of 73%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $3.2 billion for the quarter. So there was roughly a 2% unfavorable impact due to the slight strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the Canadian and Australian dollars. Given the limited FX impact on our numbers, the rest of my comments will just be a reported currency. Our reported AOI of $320 million for the quarter, was $111 million better than 2022, up 53% with an improvement of $65 million in ticketing, $50 million in concerts and $26 million in sponsorship. Over half of our AOI growth came from our Asia Pacific and Latin America markets where we are expanding our global touring activity and diversifying our historical seasonality. We converted roughly 59% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $190 million, which is significantly higher than our 43% conversion in Q1 2022. In our deferred revenue, a key leading indicator of growth ended this quarter at $4.4 billion, up 28% from this point last year.  Let me give a bit more color on each division. First, in concerts, we had the highest concert attendance ever for Q1 with 19.5 million fans attending our shows, up 79% compared to 2022 when we had approximately 11 million parents. Show count was 9,600 events, up 43% compared to 2022, with more fans per show due to a heavier mix of stadium and arena events and stronger than historical average attendance levels. As a result, our concerts revenue for the year grew by 89% to $2.3 billion, while we delivered $1 million in AOI, a $50 million improvement over Q1 2022. This is the beginning of what we see as a very solid year for our concert segment, including margin expansion relative to last year.  Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics, we had strong growth across the board. Stadium attendance more than quadrupled to 3.3 million fans this quarter, up from 800,000 fans in 2022. This growth primarily came from our Asia Pacific and Latin American markets. Arena attendance was 6.7 million fans for the quarter, up $3 million or almost 80% from 2022, largely as a result of growth in Europe and Australia touring. Theater and fan club count was up 45%. And while it's not a large quarter for festivals, we did see festival fan count grow by 50% from our Mexico and Australia and New Zealand expansion. Overall, our international markets drove fan count growth, accounting for over 90% of our increase versus 2022. This was due in part to the closure still in effect in Q1 2022. That said, we expect continued strength across all global markets through 2023, along with some seasonal shift towards Q1 activity. Last year, we discussed the various cost headwinds at our operated venues and festivals. Thus far this year, cost pressures are declining and our operational cost per fan is down across our indoor buildings and we are forecasting that cost increases will remain below general inflation levels for our festivals and amphitheaters. As a result of these improved conditions, we expect overall profitability per fan will again increase this year as cost increases are more than mitigated by increasing average revenue per fan, pricing and on-site sponsorship. Next, in ticketing, where our numbers reflect growing fan demand for live experiences. In Q1 2023, we sold $72.6 million fee-bearing tickets, up 21 million tickets or 41% compared to 2022. Nearly 2/3 of the growth was driven by concert tickets as North America concert ticket sales increased by 35%, while international concert ticket sales increased even more by 65%. With this increased ticket volume GTV for the quarter was $7.7 billion, up 60% compared to 2022. At peak sales times during the quarter, Ticketmaster sold 15,000 tickets per minute in North America with more than 20 million fee-bearing tickets sold each month globally. And in Q1, over 99.9% of all TM transactions were processed without any issues. While secondary ticketing volume grew at a similar rate, ours continues to be largely a primary ticketing business with secondary ticketing accounting for only a mid-teens percent of our overall GTV. With these growing ticket sales, revenue for the quarter was $678 million and AOI was $271 million, delivering margin of 40%. It's hard to compare these margins to Q1 of last year, given the geographic mix shift and increased cost of ramping our staff back up over the course of last year. But these margins are ahead of our full year 2022 numbers, and we expect margins for the full year to continue being in the high 30s. On the pricing front, average ticket prices on primary tickets rose by 16% compared to Q1 of 2022, driven by fan demand for the best seats, particularly at concerts. Average secondary ticket prices remain close to double that of a primary ticket continuing to show the extent to which concerts and other live events remain price below market value. We also saw revenue from nonservice fees grow double digits as we further build ancillary revenue streams, including insurance, upgrades and other upsells. Lastly, so far this year, we have signed clients accounting for nearly 8 million net new tickets, up 15% compared to this point last year, positioning us for ongoing growth. Finally, in our sponsorship business, top line revenue improved by $54 million or 47% to $170 million in Q1. Our AOI for this high-margin business was $96 million, up 37%. Sponsorship's growth during the quarter was driven by the reopening of international markets that were closed in Q1 of last year, the increase in high-profile artists on sales that attract premium marketing partners and the expansion of our venue network. We had double-digit growth in both on-site and online sponsorship with on-site sponsorship representing most of our AOI growth year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, our international markets delivered 54% growth in the quarter while North America had 26% growth. Contributing to our sustained growth since last year has been our strategic sponsors to generate over $1 million of revenue in the year. Relative to Q1 of last year, our number of strategic sponsors grew by 15%, while the revenue from those partners rose by over 20%. These marketing partnerships now account for 85% of our total sponsorship revenues. Sponsorship margins were slightly lower than average during the quarter as we had higher variable expenses due to artist activation costs for A-list talent presales with tickets sold for these key sponsor programs 4x that of last year. As timing plays out, we anticipate that for the full year, variable expenses and margins will be in line with 2022.  A few other points on 2023. We continue to project that CapEx will be approximately $450 million this year, with 2/3 on revenue-generating projects, including new venue builds and renewals as well as other organic investments to support growth. The remaining 1/3 is on maintenance CapEx as we catch up on deferred 2020 and 2021 maintenance. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of available liquidity between free cash an untapped revolver capacity, giving us ample flexibility to continue investing in growth. We're comfortable with our leverage, particularly given the AOI growth ahead with approximately 87% of our debt at a fixed rate with an average cost of debt of roughly 4.7%. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated and nothing is maturing within the next 18 months. The only notable change to our below-the-line guidance from Q1 is on accretion due largely to a set as impressive growth above previous projections, we estimate that accretion will be approximately 40% higher in 2022, and this should be factored into your EPS estimates. At this point, we don't expect any material FX impact on revenue or AOI for the year. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky : Michael, Joe, we've seen a couple of bills introduced in Congress to address ticketing practices and contracts. So wondering first, how you think some of these items might impact your business, assuming they were fully enforced. And then just based on meetings you've had do you think these bills largely meet the primary concerns of lawmakers as you've come to understand.
Michael Rapino : Yes, we're kind of watching what's going on. And we believe that through all of the noise, most people are ending up in the industry and politics at exactly where we are and the principles of what the FAIR Act is, so whether it's all in pricing, cleaning up deceptive practices and the secondary, giving artists more tools, those seem to be all the common themes coming out in all of these different bills, which we're fully supportive of. And having our own build of FAIR Act. We know Senator Cantwell and Cruz introduced theirs. [Neil] has got a bill coming in a senator Klobuchar and Cornyn. These are all in the same vein and the same thematic around helping the artist control their ticket and get them in the hands of the fans and be away of some of the practices and the secondary and the spec selling deceptive sites hopefully, better protection on BOTS, and we've always supported all in pricing. So this is not LN versus any of these. We are aligned to all of these bills. We think all of these bills, we've said continually for a long time, is better for our business because it helps us deliver a better on sale and fan experience. So right now, it's the Wild West, we're doing our best, but any bills and these natures that start putting some better regulations and controls around the experience is going to help our overall business.
David Karnovsky : Okay. Then I was hoping you can expand a bit more on Vibee. Maybe can you frame the opportunity -- is this something you plan to build primarily for your major festivals and residencies, or is this -- is there a wider opportunity across your promotional footprint? And then just interested what drove the decision to kind of build this out internally versus maybe putting that out to bid for an events partner.
Michael Rapino : Yes, we look at this segment overall. If you look at what we've been talking about on our Investor Day for the last few years, the premium business is a huge opportunity for us. I think I've said any time this is an industry that has done a great job of being scaled GA, but not done a great job of doing a premium experience for customers. The sports and new arenas and stadiums are doing a great job on that. But as an industry, like nation and the music industry has not done that. And we think there's a great opportunity overall to launch more products and services that can provide a better premium experience for the customer. So this would just be an extension and a continual strategy towards what we call the premium experience. We've got a company called VIP Nation. We'll do about 1,000 of those events this year. Those are based around the concert and the tour and going to a sound check or early experience or a meet and greet. So we've been the leader in that space and expanding that Ticketmaster's launch, Ticketmaster travel, looking at ways we can put both the ticket and an airline or hotel together and take advantage of that scale, and we've been testing that in the UK with great success. And Vibee is another product where we looked at Poland and we looked at on location and CID and Clint and others that were doing it. The difference is we have the scale, but we already have been doing it. We have the expertise. So we looked at our Insomniac team and built up [Body] launched it with the U2 experience sold out or close to $20 million in ticket sales around a high-end premium experience. So we have the in-house expertise, and this is another product in our ongoing strategy, whether it's clubs, premium memberships, premium clubs, subscriptions, all the ways we're going to continue to look to say how do we from the GA into a premium experience product. I know there's also the challenge of some of these other companies have is the expensive part about doing this is the right, and we don't have that problem. So when you're chasing the Olympic rights you're chasing a business for premium, it's a little harder unless you're in-house. So I'm sure our location does fabulous with their UFC experiences files, we don't have to pay rights. These are our rights. So we can do it in-house. We don't have to outsource it and split any of that upside with anyone else but our own businesses.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. 
Brandon Ross : One on your fundamentals and then a follow-up to David's question on the sales and Congress. Actually, I'll start with that one. I think the Klobuchar bill very specifically attacks your venue exclusivity. Can you kind of just respond to that, Bill? And how important is the venue exclusivity model for you in North America? And then kind of on the fundamentals, last year was obviously a pretty depressed year in terms of constant margins. I know you take the word margins, Joe, but we'll go with it anyway. Is -- should we see a real bounce back in that and continuing type of from 2030 and beyond into future years.
Joe Berchtold : First of all, on the exclusivity point, I think first point I should make is, congratulations on the birth of your daughter. Glad to hear, everybody is doing well. But to the exclusivity point, I always start with, these are the venues rights. And the venues have been figuring out over time, how do they best monetize certain rights they have. What they have determined is the best way to monetize those rights in the U.S. is by actioning them off for exclusivity. So I think it's, frankly, primarily were there to be any changes in exclusivity it's venues that would be hurt the most because they would lose the ability to fully maximize their rights. We're very confident with the quality of our systems, its ability to handle on sales in a way that no other system can do has been shown both by the clients that we've been adding as well as you've seen in the press issues that other systems have with very modest on sales. So we're very confident in our ability to deliver. I think it's uncertain any bill, in today's Congress, not just this one, but any bill that doesn't have bipartisan support out of the gate as its challenges. But more fundamentally, I think that you'd see the venues respond to that and probably push back because they would be hurt a lot more than we would. In terms of the performance of the business, I tried to give a lot of details in there. I think that, as you know, first of all, we look more at the cash profitability of the business, where that is, how that's operating on a basis, which, as I said, we expect to continue to grow this year. I also noted, I think, in the concert side, the last year was a bottom tick in terms of our margins. We expect it to be coming back this year. We don't assess over margins because, for instance, this year, we expect to be having a great stadium and arena year, as you could tell by the numbers we already gave for that's inherently going to be a lower-margin business than one of our amputate customers. We're still going to pursue that business, still a great business, but it impacts technically the margin, while generating cash profitability. So I think that we're on an upward trajectory. I think '23 is going to be great. And every very early sign we have for '24 is continued success.
Brandon Ross : Just one quick follow-up to that comment. I think there's concern about lapping the supply side for next year. Do you feel good the supply side coming out of the '22 and '23. I know you get asked this question every year as things grow. But do you feel confident with what you're seeing so far? That’s all.
Michael Rapino : Yes. Yes. We -- as you know, yes, we live this in the -- I think the fall was all about the air pocket and would there be enough shows in '23. So hopefully, we put that to bed. We don't think this has anything to do with pent-up demand or COVID rescheduling. That stuff has long been clushed out in '22. This is all about regular business back to business. And I think we're thrilled that we're sitting here looking of a comparable last year but basically had almost 1.5 years combined into a year because of all those rescheduled shows at 20 million. To be sitting here today above and beyond last year's numbers, shows the global strength of the business, and it also shows the global strength of the business from the amphitheater and the stadium to the club to the festival. We're looking at all territories around the world. Firing on all cylinders. We're looking at the kind of talent you see on the road right now. This isn't just The Rolling Stones, right? The question we always have to fight off, six of the top 10 artists were younger artists. You look at Lollapalooza Coachella with Bad Bunny, Carol G, Rosalina, the BLACKPINK, the BTSs, Billie Eilish. I mean there's just a host of great new talent every year coming up, filling the pipe that we didn't know Luke Combs was going to be selling stadiums out this year, two years ago. We had no idea Bad Bunny was going to be the largest selling artists last year. So we just continue to see the supply/demand, we think, for the future, is really, really strong. There's more and more artists sitting in the studio right now on TikTok. The greater economy is alive and low and they all want to be the next bad money. And we said it before, we're also seeing this encouraging new supply strategy where for many years, it was all about a U.S. or UK-based artists that filled the charts and fill the stadium. And most other talent was domestic. It might have been big in Canada, it might have been big in area, but it didn't travel. This is the real breakout year where the world and the consumer are truly global. And now you can see artists coming from Latin America and Korea and becoming global superstars. That didn't happen for the last 30 years. It was a very top U.S. or UK controlled industry. So we think that alone gives the next kick to the supply chain for the next 10 years of young talent from -- it will be from India, South Africa, it's going to be everywhere overnight finding their way to TikTok and Spotify and other places to become these global stars that are still in arenas and stadiums out in their markets.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Laszczyk : Maybe for Michael, on underlying contract demand, setting aside the stadium and arena tours for the moment. Can you maybe talk about how demand for the average or even smaller amphitheater or club show is trending compared to what we saw for those types of shows last year? I think there's some concern that maybe the top shows are performing well this year, but it's perhaps coming at the expense of the smaller ones. So just love to hear your thoughts on how those smaller and average size shows are performing?
Joe Berchtold : Yes, Stephen, Yes. Just to give you the feel on that, we don't have a lot of amphitheaters yet just in the first quarter. But if you look at our theaters and clubs, which tend to be pretty strong at this point of the year, they're tracking around 8% ahead in terms of average attendance per show. We're doing that with also increased pricing, lower cost structure on a per fan basis. So those shows are performing very well for us.
Michael Rapino : And just to jump on Joe there. Unlike the movie theater kind of model, we're not a hit-driven industry, right, where we are a truly scaled business. And you're right, we looked at -- the Beyonces of the world are always going to do the great numbers. But when you're sitting here today, looking at even our festivals, the Lollapaloozas are the easy ones, but we have over 200 festivals, Bonnaroos to one-day festivals in smaller markets to our U.S. and international businesses. And all of it seems to be doing really, really well. So whether it's a middle of a road festival in a smaller market, whether it's a club act. At all levels, there seems to be incredible demand and on a global basis. So we haven't seen just the top stuff selling and they're not coming to the other stuff. The demand seems to be uniformed from clubs to stadiums from Pittsburgh to Milan. 
Stephen Laszczyk : Great. And then maybe just one on the venues business. You called out in the press release, I think you expect to host 3 million incremental fans at new Live Nation venues this year. I'm curious, maybe for Joe, if you look at ambitions on the venue side, how many incremental fans or shows you think you can add to the flywheel over the next couple of years, maybe just given how the venue pipeline stands today? 
Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think this year would be typical in what we would hope to add in the low millions per year from our own venues with a mix of some new amphitheaters, new arenas at the larger end, while continuing to build out the club and theater portfolio. So it continues to be a meaningful part of it and more robust. As I said earlier, you can scale the stadiums and arenas faster. But over time, we've learned we can deliver a very accretive return for our shareholders by operating it and being able to count the beer money and the sponsorship money as well. 
Michael Rapino : And I think we laid that out in our November Investor Day, probably on a more macro level. We wanted to remind investors, we've been doing this for a long time. We have a large venue portfolio we don't see that strategy changing. It's not incrementally different than it's been year after year. We bolt on and continue to look around the world at opportunist markets where there's a great return, and we keep adding a venue club theater an arena, if we can find the right market like Austin, where it's a big return. So we'll continue that strategy over time. And I think we laid out in November cleaner in terms of how many and what numbers we look to subscribe to over time. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Bazinet : I just had a question about your cash balance, seems like used to run, I don't know, $0.5 billion or something and it's been 4x that or something over the last year. Do you just think that in the spirit of being cautious that it just makes sense to have more cash on hand? Or do you think there's some flexibility to deploy it in one way or another?
Joe Berchtold : No, I think just to make sure you have the cash numbers right, I think those cash numbers included untapped revolver capacity, right? So from that metric, it's probably not quite that extreme, but we continue to see a very strong set of opportunities to continue growing the business. We just talked about the venue business, which we've been in, but we think on a global basis has a lot of great opportunities to continue to build out the portfolio. And we think even within our existing portfolio, there's a lot of things that we can do to enhance the fan experience as Michael was talking about. So at the moment, we're maybe being a little conservative coming out of COVID, but looking to continue to grow the business, and we'll continue to assess it and see what the right options are. 
Jason Bazinet : Can I just ask one follow-up. One of the more interesting things to me, looking at your stock price is, it seems so depressed relative to the fundamentals you guys have been putting up for the last year or so part of the DOJ related part of it fears of sort of of pent-up demand. But I was just surprised that you guys didn't sort of take advantage of that seeming disconnect with share repurchases.
Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think the flip side of -- share repurchases tactically is one thing. I think we've also seen a lot of companies out there that embark on share repurchases and the market takes that as a signal that they are out of growth ideas. And I think that we have such a robust set of growth ideas that we wouldn't want that to be misunderstood. Secondly, when you invest in growth, you deliver compounded returns over time, you can maybe get an attractive return from a stock if you think there's a dislocation but you lose out on the accretive compounding impact that you can have by investing in these growth opportunities. As I said, I think we'll continue to look at all the options as we move forward. But I think in the immediacy of coming out of it, that's been our thought process. .
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with TD Cowen. 
Stephen Glagola : Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael and Joe. Just -- I had two specific questions around the proposed legislation and how that's going to potentially could potentially impact your business. So one on prohibition of ticket and exclusivity with venues. Can you just provide like, I guess, your color on the competitive position of Ticketmaster in international markets that you operate on an allocation or nonexclusive model, just to kind of glean insights on how the U.S. could be from that, like how renewals are trending there and new business there, one? And then two, on this Junk Fee Protection Act, I believe there's a provision that the FTC can determine if mandatory ticketing fees are excessive. So I just wanted to know how would fee caps impact your service fee revenue. Would that impact more than what the venue collects or what the primary ticketing service collects as well? 
Michael Rapino : I think you need to go to some of the [Bob Roux] interview. It will help you. The venue drivers, as Joe said, this is the venue business. I know everyone wants to subscribe at the end demand, most of the service fee and kind of do the auction for the ticket. So Again, we think that the venue that's built in the $1 billion arena or the multibillion dollar stadium in that market, I think he's going to continually be pretty strong and vocal about his rights and returns on what companies he can hire exclusively or not to service his business, so whether it's Microsoft or CRM or Salesforce or Ticketmaster. I think they're going to look at all their options for their best return for their business. So we look at that from that perspective.  We look at Europe just because we've always thrown out really lightly that international as an allocation in the U.S. is here. Just kind of for the trend, International is moving more towards an exclusive model than away from it as new buildings are being built over there and you're building your arena, which really had been underdeveloped. It was mostly a soccer business or football. But as the new buildings are getting built, they are looking over here and realizing that this is another revenue stream that they should be leveraging. So I look at international probably moving closer to the U.S. model in the U.S. model moving to the international model because I think they're now realizing that they've been under valuing their exclusive ticketing rights for their venues. Now we do really well over there because we always will do well in an open market with the best technology. We sell more tickets than the competitor. So if you're an open allocated market and you're going to allocate to us and others, we're going to do really, really well because we're going to be the 1 that probably sells the most tickets for you, so you'll end up allocating more to us. But we don't think that model probably ends up here, more driven by the venue agenda than the ticketing agenda.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. 
David Katz : Thanks for including covered a lot, but I was hoping you could just talk about the secondary ticketing market, which seems to be an area of growth for new smaller entities, other approaches, technologies, et cetera. And I know you've talked about in the past how what their impact is on the market. What's new with respect to that? What can you do about it to protect yourselves better? And I'd just love an update there, please, if you could.
Michael Rapino : I'll jump and then Joe will -- I just want to remind what we said earlier, of all the legislative noise, we've been swirling around for 6 months. The common theme in all of this legislation that you're seeing come forward is around limiting and putting some handcuffs around the scalper and the business. So we do see a lot of this legislation moving forward is going to help the primary ticket, the content holder, do a better job on that front. And it will be harder for the scalper or the BOT, deceptive website, spec selling, a lot of practices, drip selling, et cetera. So we do think that overall, this market right now, legislatively, is moving against the secondary business in general, not going to ban it, not going to cap it, but some of the cleanup legislation does help primary hertz secondary. That's a big move that hasn't happened in the last 10, 15 years.
Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think the other piece is you have to remember that secondary for sports is very different than secondary in concert. Secondary and sports is often used as a distribution platform where you sell the season and ticket to the scalpers, they disaggregate it and they're performing a function for the sports teams of guaranteeing them some upfront funding that has value to the teams, the value to the fans. You don't have that in concerts. The concerts, the issue is that they're using illegal and deceptive practices to get tickets with the sole objective of increasing the price and selling them to the fans. So I think what you're seeing is because the artists don't have the same sort of collective central power that a league does today, they can set up an NFL ticket exchange, you need to give the power back to the artists. So it's very clear that they can be the decision-maker. And then it becomes the onus of the secondary players to figure out how they're adding value. Like any other business today, you have to survive and adapt and grow because you're adding value to others in your ecosystem. That hasn't been what -- how the scalpers have done it in music over the past several years, and it's finally gotten another point where you're getting the put back now from the artists, and that's being fully understood by our politicians.
David Katz : Thank you. And to say next quarter would be understating beating by $100 million. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin Swinburne : Two questions. Michael, you also mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks that the secondary prices are running about 2x primary. Last year, I think it was last year, sort of that Bruce Springsteen moment about market pricing expectations that more artists would embrace that. I was wondering if you could just sort of update us today on sort of the trend in market pricing on primary and sort of pricing back house, front of house the right way and where you feel the industry is and the business is today? And then secondly, you guys are always thinking pretty far ahead around technology. What are your thoughts on AI as an opportunity for Live Nation? Just broadly, it's obviously a huge topic these days. So would love to hear what you think.
Michael Rapino : Perfect. On pricing, I think we've been saying it for the last few years, the great transparency and sunlight of secondary has really helped the artists and the management team look at their pricing models. Historically, it was a fairly static pricing, three different maybe price points, same price points all across the country. It matter if there was a Friday in New York or Tuesday in Pittsburgh. So the business has gotten really, really sophisticated with our PriceMaster or different dynamic models that artists can now use. So we see that there's still years away between where the artist markets, the price and what the market is willing to pay. The artist is one of the few products in the world that's worth more than it's sold, but they do that for their brand and accessibility. And I think that will continue. But I do think we've seen the artists looking at their ticket price and the whole manifest and how do we bring the prices down in the back, bring the prices up in the front, so we can sell out and make sure everyone gets a ticket at an affordable price, but let's not let secondary runway of the front row. So we think that we're still dramatically underpriced versus demand, and you see that every day on the secondary. And we think that's probably going to live for the next 5 to 10 years as the artist moves closer to market, probably never gets to market. But between here and where they feel comfortable, we think there's years of upside that they'll continue to look at. AI, Joe, you can talk about the TM. 
Joe Berchtold : Yes. Yes. I think on AI, just to be clear, I think it's all upside for us. There's no concern that somehow AI can never replace the live experience. For us, it's a -- I consider it an infrastructure tool for both efficiency and effectiveness. So if you think about using AI on recommendations, much better marketing much better individual recommendation in terms of making you aware of shows that you might want to go to. Clearly, we're using machine learning now to help inform models on suggesting pricing that we were just talking about. AI is just the same thing to the next level of data input through that machine learning process. It will help us automate a lot of tools, the event creation process that takes place at every venue being able to use much better data, machine learning, whatever what's going on elsewhere in the PM system will make that more efficient. All the chatbots that you have today, those will go to a whole another level of effectiveness, working with fans and be at a much lower cost than you have today. And then as we're fighting bots using AI to continue in our battles, to make sure we know who's a person or try to know who's a person, Brit, who's not. So it kind of runs throughout all of our infrastructure. It's a lot of places that we're using machine learning today AI is really that to the next level.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy : I just wanted to ask a question on kind of the pace of growth. I mean when we look at deferred revenue, I think it's up almost 30%. You talked about the concert ticket sales at this point, up 20%. Any help to you could give us just on if you think that type of pace of growth can be sustained this year. I think the message is clear, it's going to be a strong year, but would just love to get a little color and flavor about kind of the speed of what you could grow this year.
Joe Berchtold : Yes. I think that you generally start the year coming out of the gate fastest when you're led by stadiums and arenas. So that -- those are the shows that we've long talked about put on sale earliest relative to the show date. So you've got great scalability in the stadiums, which are seeing 4x the level of activity, good scalability in your arenas. So that's driving your huge increase in attendance, strong increase in ticket sales at $90 million in your deferred revenue. I think as you get into more of the shows that take place in our buildings, across the festivals, amphitheaters to some extent a you generally have a lower level of scalability. You still have very solid growth, but not the same level as you have with your stadiums and arenas. So I don't think we're ready to try to declare an exact number, but I think we recognize the level you have in Q1 is probably going to be the high point of the year. .
Michael Rapino : And I think -- sorry, I just want to jump on there for one second, John. And just what's more important to us is just helping both sides realize what's the future in '24 on. So we went through -- obviously, COVID was down and last year was an extraordinary year. The Hut does '23 and '24 start to look. And we're very optimistic. We look at this year as being a very strong year coming off what people probably thought we couldn't be last year. We think '24 into forward, you kind of look at what we historically have delivered. We've been a high single industry growth business and a high single-digit revenue AOI business year after year for many years. And we look at going forward, we think we're back to being a great strong growth business year-over-year off this foundation of business. So we think the industry is back bigger than ever. And we think there's years of industry growth we've shown you when the industry grows, we tend to do a rise with that tide and capture as much as industry growth or we tend to do a couple of points better. So industry has been growing about 8% or 9% a year. We tend to beat it. We look at this as a long-term continual growth story again.
John Healy : Great. And then just a big picture question I wanted to ask. I think you called out APAC and Latin America is fueling some growth at the start of the year. Just as you think about those businesses long term, is it safe to say that as they become a bigger piece of the pie, the margin level of the business should rise. Are those -- I always thought those businesses had potential to be maybe higher margin than the U.S. market, but was just kind of curious how thinking about those as they sit today.
Joe Berchtold : Yes. I don't think we start with thinking about it as margin. We think about them as being massive growth potential markets, probably the least developed of our major markets. So having great growth opportunity to continue to drive more fans, and more obviously, highly profitable fans. As we establish more venues in those markets, I am sure that you can get some attractive margin operability as you operate, but I think more than starting with any margin focus we're looking at just what's the volume of fans and what's the overall concerts, ticketing, sponsorship, profitability, we can drive off that.
Operator: At this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Now I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael Rapino for any closing comments.
Michael Rapino : Appreciate everyone. Thank you. We'll talk to you in the summer.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-23 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. My name is John, and I will be your conference operator on today's call.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In 2022, fans around the world continue to prioritize their spend on attending live events, particularly concerts. Our research consistently tells us that concerts are top priority for discretionary spending. And one of the last experiences fans will cut back on. And we're seeing this play out in both our 2022 results and early indicators for 2023. With the strong demand last year in the cancer business, we had 121 million fans attend our shows across 45 countries. While in ticketing, we helped connect 550 million fans with their favorite artists, teams and performers. In both cases, the majority of our growth came from international markets, further reinforcing the global nature of untapped fan demand and the opportunities we have for growth as we help artists reach more fans with their live music. Before getting into details on our division, just to note that 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results. Most of our metrics will be relative to full year 2019. In concerts, despite many markets still closed for part of last year, we grew attendance by 24% to 121 million fans at 44,000 events, which drove revenue up 43% to $13.5 billion. This growth came from all markets and venue types. Every venue type from clubs and theaters, to stadiums, to festivals, had double-digit attendance growth. We invested $9.6 billion in putting artist shows on in 2022, working with the largest superstars to artists just getting started and all those in between. This is up 45% and further reinforces our role as the largest contributor to our artist income. As part of this, we helped shift $700 million to artists with more market value ticket pricing, even as the entry price to a show stayed below $35 in the U.S. Typically, 90% of ticket sales for Live Nation shows go to artists. This is particularly important as artists are increasingly reliant on touring as they get much smaller rev shares from other music revenue streams. Part of our fan growth continues to come from the venues we operate globally, closed almost 50 million fans in 2022 with international markets, again, delivering the majority of our growth. In Venue Nation, we continued our focus on elevating the fan experience and providing a range of options for enhanced products and services. As a result, last year, we grew our average revenue per fan by 20% at all venue types. In ticketing, our strategy for success is simple. We focus on developing the leading software for venues to ensure we deliver the best enterprise platform, we invest tens of millions of dollars every year to continue innovating every aspect of ticketing technology products. Artists are the venue's largest clients, and we're regularly being asked to create new products to help address their ticketing needs. Amongst our innovations are products such as Verified Fan, designed to help artists cut down resale, and we've seen this successfully for over 400 tours, including the most recent on sales for Beyoncé, Madonna and Morgan Wallen. Generally, Verified Fan onsales have approximately 5% in inventory end up on resale sites versus 20% to 30% that is typical for non-Verified Fan on sales. Venue and their artist clients see the result in the ticket sales, which is the large part why so many venues choose to work with us. Looking at our 2022 results, we grew fee-bearing ticket volume by 28% to $280 million, which in turn drove our fee-bearing GTV, up by over 50% to $28 billion across 38 countries. As a result, our ticketing revenue was $2.2 billion, up 45%. Along with these results for the year, we signed 23 million net new tickets in 2022, 70% were with international clients in the stage for continued global growth. In our sponsorship business, we have seen that brands are as eager as fans to reengage with platforms. In 2022, we had 120 large strategic sponsors globally across our businesses, 32% more than we had in 2019, including brands such as PayPal, Go PoP, Google and Snap. These large partners drove over 80% of our growth, with overall revenue up 64% to $1 billion. As with concerts and ticketing, our international markets led this growth with international sponsorship ROI up 70%. Looking ahead to 2023, as we announce any of our 2023 shows on sale. We continue to see strong consumer demand globally with no sign of any slowdown. We have four key leading indicators at this time of the year, all pointing towards another record year and even greater success in 2023. First, our deferred revenue at the end of 2022 was $2.7 billion, up 125% from 2019 and 18% from 2021, which benefited from a high volume of rescheduled chose. Next, as of mid-February, ticket sales for our shows this year exceeded 50 million fans, up 20% from this point last year with international growth of 25%. Then our global ticketing fee-bearing GTV is up 33% to $9.8 billion through the same period. And finally, over 70% of our planned sponsorship activity for the year is confirmed, again, up double digits relative to this time last year. Before I turn it over to Joe, I want to comment on the regulatory environment and industry reforms. On the regulatory front, the ticketing industry is more competitive than ever, and our market share has gone down, not up since the merger. Because of the competitive bidding process, venues regularly take more of the economics on every renewal as they set and keep a majority of the service fees. In signing the extended consent decree related to the Ticketmaster merger, we remain in constant conversations with the DOJ monitors and do not believe there have been any violations. On ticketing reforms, we believe the greater transparency on the entire ticketing ecosystem will improve the industry, and we've been engaging with policymakers to advocate for reforms. The biggest challenge facing the industry is a chaos at the on sale where fans can't get the ticket at the price they are set yet they see page of secondary sites with tickets five times the face value because of scalpers. This has been a big topic in the industry and conversations at the pulse our live conference this week, focused on how to protect the connection between the artists and their fans. To help drive progress, we launched the Fair Ticketing Act, which says artists should decide resell lots selling, speculative tickets should be illegal. The scope of the BOT Act should be expanded and enforced. And it needs to be industry-wide all-in pricing, so fans see the full cost they are paying upfront. Artists create their music and their concerts. It's only fair to create their ticket and rules too. We will always be on the side of the artist who is the best advocate for their career and their fan base. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more details.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the uniqueness with our seasonality in 2022 after emerging from the pandemic, I will largely focus on our annual results. And as with prior quarters, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results so much of our discussion will be relative to the full year 2019. For the company, our reported revenue of $16.7 billion for the year was $5.1 billion better than 2019 or an increase of 44%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $17.3 billion for the year. So there was roughly a 4% unfavorable impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the euro and the pound. Our reported AOI of $1.407 billion for the year was also a record for the company, $465 million better than 2019, up 49%, led by an improvement of $345 million in ticketing and $226 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our full year AOI was $1.464 billion. The FX impact was negative $57 million or 4%. And we have converted roughly 69% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $967 million, leading to a year-end free cash balance of nearly $1.8 billion. Net income for the year was also a record at $296 million, $226 million better than 2019, resulting in earnings per share of $0.64. Let me give a bit more color on each division. First, in concerts, we had the most concert fans ever with 121 million fans attending our shows in 2022, up 24% compared to 2019 when we had close to 98 million fans. Show count was 43,600 events, up 8% compared to 2019, with more fans per show due to a heavier mix of stadium and festival events. As a result, our concerts revenue for the year grew by 43% to $13.5 billion, while we delivered $170 million of AOI. Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics. We had strong growth across the board. Stadium attendance more than doubled to 18.4 million fans this year up from 7.8 million fans in 2019. Festival attendance was 13.2 million fans for the year, up over 30% from 2019, with premier events, including Rock in Rio in Brazil, Rock Werchter in Belgium, Reading & Leeds in the UK and Lollapalooza in Chicago. Arena, amphitheater and club and theater attendance were all up double digits. And finally, our international fan count grew by nearly 50% in 2022, fueled by tremendous outdoor season in the UK and across Mainland Europe, and very strong growth in our South American markets as well as the addition of OCESA in Mexico. Giving you more details on ancillary per fan revenue by venue type, in our North America amphitheaters ancillary per fan revenue was $37, an increase of $8 per fan over 2019 levels or over 25% growth. At our major festivals globally, increased spending on concessions, camping and DIP experiences drove ancillary per fan revenue up nearly 30%. And there are theaters and clubs in the U.S. and the UK ancillary per fan revenue increased by 20%, driven by higher concession sales, fast lane entry, night of show upgrades and the move to cashless payments. As we have discussed in past quarters, we've had some headwinds associated with labor and supply chain cost pressures at venues we operate, notably amphitheaters and festivals as well as costs related to the reopening of our international markets during the year. Despite this, we still increased our per fan profitability, taking into account our company-wide revenue streams for fans attending shows at our venues. We have seen these pressures subside in recent months and do not expect the same level of impact in 2023. With this, along with our ongoing revenue initiatives and continued cost focus, we expect to continue to grow per fan profitability in 2023. Next, ticketing, where our numbers reflect sustained fan demand for the live experience. In 2022, we sold $281 million fee-bearing tickets, up 28% compared to 2019. It was the first year that our fee-bearing ticket sales exceeded non-fee-bearing ticket sales as we continue to build our global non-sports client base, particularly in international markets. With this increased ticket volume, GTV for the year was $27.5 billion, up 54% compared to 2019. Ours continues to be largely a primary ticketing business with secondary ticketing accounting for only a mid-teens percent of our overall GTV. With this activity level, revenues are over $2.2 billion for the year with AOI of $830 million. As we projected last quarter, we delivered full year margins in the high 30s, coming in at 37%. On the pricing front, average ticket prices on primary tickets rose by 17% compared to 2019, driven by fan demand for the best seats at premier concert and sporting events. Secondary ticketing pricing also rose by 12% on average and so the average secondary ticket price in the U.S. remained more than double that of a primary ticket. This shows the extent to which concerts and other live events remain priced below market value. We also saw revenue from nonservice fees grow double digits as we further build ancillary revenue streams, including insurance, upgrades and other upsells. Lastly, as Michael noted, we signed 23 million net new tickets and expect these client wins will help drive an increase in fee-bearing tickets sold for this year, positioning us for ongoing growth. Before leaving ticketing, I wanted to add a few comments on the regulatory front that Michael spoke to you. There has been a lot of discussion lately about so-called junk fees. We tend to get thrown into that conversation because the compensation to venues to help run their businesses and to Ticketmaster to distribute tickets is separately called out as a service fee instead of embedded in the price of the ticket. Very few people understand that and even fewer understand that most of the money goes to the venues. They think the service charges are just some arbitrary add-on to Ticketmaster pockets, which is not the case. We agree that real junk fees, hidden charges attached the goods and services that obscure the true price should be illegal. As one of the reasons we're advocating for legislation mandating all-in pricing where the consumer first sees the total price he or she is going to pay, as well as the breakdown of any fees. There are a range of other policy points that we're advocating for because we're strong proponents of artists and content rights, but none of these have a direct material impact on our business. Finally, it was a record year for our sponsorship business with top line revenue of $968 million, up 64%. Our AOI for this high-margin business was $592 million, up 62%. Looking back at sponsorship's growth during the year, our festival business increased by 75% and our platform integrations more than doubled. Once again, we had high growth in both on-site and online sponsorship of 61% and 64%, respectively, compared to 2019. Our international markets had an exceptional growth rate this year with AOI increasing by over 70% compared to 2019 due to greater festival activity across Europe and our expanding business in South America and Mexico. A few other points on 2023, while it's still very early in the year, based on current FX rates, we project very little impact on our revenue and AOI this year, less than 1%. We expect CapEx to be approximately $450 million this year, with two thirds on revenue-generating projects, including new venue builds and renewals and as well as other organic investments to support our growth. This is slightly higher relative to the past few years as we come out of supply chain constraints and generally tight spend controls. However, as a percentage of revenue, this is well within our historical range and consistent with our growth trajectory. We ended the year with $2.3 billion of available liquidity between free cash an untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. As you're aware, in January, we issued $1 billion principal amount of 3.8 percent convertible senior notes due in 2029. As part of that transaction, we then developed a hedge to increase the effective convert price to $144. We used roughly half the net proceeds to repurchase the 2.5% convertible notes that were due in 2023, meaning we expect minimal dilution from this convert offering. We're comfortable with our leverage. Over 85% of our debt is at a fixed rate with an average cost of debt of roughly 4.7%, positioning us well in this interest rate environment. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated and nothing is maturing within the next 18 months. Given that we're at the beginning of the year, we want to provide with more guidance on a few line items below AOI, which impact our earnings per share calculation. We anticipate the noncash compensation will be largely in line with 2022 and acquisition transaction expenses will run about two thirds of last year. As we continue our global expansion, we expect depreciation and amortization to grow by approximately $50 million for the year, evenly phased amongst the quarters. Given our recent financing, interest expense will increase to approximately $90 million per quarter. We're projecting accretion to be about 25% higher than last year, resulting from stronger forecasted future performance at a number of our joint ventures. And we anticipate that NCI and income tax expense will grow in line with AOI. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with Lightshed Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Brandon Ross: Yes thanks for taking the question. You laid out your prescription for solving many of the structural issues in ticketing today. But there is a lot of elected officials and fans that think you're way too big despite the slipping share that you highlighted. And I want to know why are both your ticketing and promotion business is so dominant? And why wouldn't a more competitive industry solve any of these issues at hand with the ticket buying experience?
Joe Berchtold: Thanks Brandon. It's Joe. I think when you look at our business, our business in both concerts and ticketing have been successful because they very effectively serve their constituents. So on the concert side, I mean if you go back to ten years, we and AG were roughly similar size. We've had a very focused strategy of super serving the artist, which has led to a lot of success in terms of continuing to work with more of the artists. In ticketing, we have the best product out there, full stop. Michael spoke to why it is, we've been effective continuing to work with a large number of venues because we have the best software platform for them, and we work with them to develop tools and products for artists who are their key constituents when figuring out where they're going to be touring. So, it's hard to answer your question with where would we be if we didn't have someone who developed such great tools for the venues and such, and serve the artists so well, I think, we would have a smaller industry. I think we have consistently grown the industry through our approaches to the business. And overall, the ecosystem is better for it.
Brandon Ross: Okay. And then you talked about the amount of junk that's in ticket fees, and it's a huge concern of, I think, fans and regulators. The amount of fees or the percentage of fees that go into each ticket sale. Can you get a little more granular on why ticket prices are so high? What percentage of the fees goes to you and what is “junk”? And then you have these growing junk fees, you're giving venues of bigger and bigger cut, and now there's the consumer and regulatory pressure, why should the investors be worried about the sustainability of the Ticketmaster and the Live Nation O&O venue ticket fees as we look to the future?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. Just first, correction, these aren't junk fees. Junk fees are low-value hidden fees to show up later. This is our version of the markup of the base wholesale price of the product is shared by us and the venue. Amazon collects 50% of the retail price, Apple collects 30%. So this is a version of the amount of the money that goes the venue for the services they provide, Ticketmaster for the services they provide. So it's not junk fees. What we've said is that the majority of the fees go to the venue. And typically, when you renew with a venue because of the competitive nature of the bidding process, more of the fees goes to the venue. I don't think it makes much sense for us to give exact breakdowns because then, obviously, everybody below the average in the next discussion once they get to be above the average. And so it's not a very commercially wise move for us to give those specific numbers. But generally, that's been the trend, and that's what's been happening. The venue sets the fees and the venues costs have been going up, service fees have been going up. I think it would be a very unique situation where you would tell the building what their fees could be. I think it's more likely you got all-in pricing, where they see the total cost upfront quite transparently. And frankly, if you were to cap fees, what would end up happening is you then have increased rent and other costs for the artists would go up because the venue needs to recoup their costs as part of the ecosystem.
Brandon Ross: So you are saying if ticket prices or ticket fees were regulated, then ticket prices would just stay the same because they would just be passed on in another way?
Joe Berchtold: Very possible that's what happened, yes.
Brandon Ross: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Michael Rapino: Historically, Brandon, there was a division on what the artist was charging to the consumer and then what were the added revenue streams or fees that were going to be added on top of that. And it’s kind of in search state historically. But now, as you know, we've said it many times, the artist takes most of that ticket fee base. So the way that the venue, the promoter or the ticketing company earn their revenue fees is through that extra fee. You're right we would love to more just to make it all in pricing. So the consumer is very clear from the beginning that to go see the true cost to the show isn't $25, it's $50 because that's how all of the participants need to be participate for that show to happen. Now tomorrow, if someone said, you know what, those $25 fees, you shouldn't have them. Well, then the van you would say, okay, artist, the rent isn't $50,000 anymore, it's $100,000. And the fees would add up and then all of a sudden, that ticket price wouldn't be $25, it would be $50 on a value. So it is inefficient. That's why we're a big proponent of all-in pricing and all our pricing at the beginning of the process, which you don't see right now on most companies other than ours. So we believe that we all want to know what is the true cost to see the show when I start shopping. We wish that would be mandated tomorrow across the board that would relieve a lot of the stress, the consumer's perception that there's this magical extra fee added on that is not kind of part of the overall show cost.
Brandon Ross: Got it. Thanks for the explanation.
Michael Rapino: And to your point on Live Nation owned and operated, just to hammer the point home to your point is right. If tomorrow, someone said, you know you can't charge 20% service fees on your amphitheater, you have to be $10, well, then the $75,000 house not rent that we charge Argus, would be $100,000, right? So we couldn't – we wouldn't absorb the cost. We still have to pay staff capital, run the building so we have to find the revenue in the other means. So the true cost of going to a show and making the show happen isn't the full price all in. We just need to now market that upfront better.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan.
David Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. Michael, I think over the years we've become accustomed to seeing some level of criticism against Live Nation or Ticketmaster from politicians, trade press, social media that certainly elevated lately though. So I wanted to ask what actions were you thinking about taking to be more proactive in managing the public perception or your relationship with lawmakers that could maybe help limit what's become a periodic concern for investors.
Michael Rapino: Yes, it's a great question. First, I want to kind of look at where the drama that gets created, if you kind of zoom out, we did 550 million tickets last year, about 540 million of those were happy customers that were seamlessly delivered. About 10 million of those are five tours historically a year, have this incredible demand with supply demand is out of whack and it creates lots of tension and unhappy customers. And that's kind of always kind of been the historic challenge in the business. At Live Nation Ticketmaster, historically we've really been a B2B business. Our Ticketmaster job is to service the venue and our concert job is to service the artist. And we've done a fabulous job building those businesses and having very, very happy customers. And part of that proposition historically has been to take a bit of the heat at the front end. When the ticket prices are high, when the service fees are high, if the demand supplies out of whack, Ticketmaster has historically been the one that's taken the punch or the ticket seller in general, if you look at all ticket companies, all their NPL scores are all kind of the same. There's only two customers as Fred Rosen famously said, the one that got the ticket is happy and all the ones that didn't are pissed off, right? So you never always – you can never kind of make – this is an industry where there's just not enough inventory to make everyone happy. And we've lived that historically. But absolutely, we've got to now start adjusting on our B2C side. We've got to get much more lean forward on our government relations and our PR side. We've historically not had a big incentive to kind of shout out loud that venues are charging high service fees or artist costs are expensive that hasn't been a big business incentive to date. But I think now education is paramount. We've got to now go out and do a much better job. So the policymakers, some consumers understand how the business does operate and how we all have a hand on the wheel, and we've got to all probably do a better job going forward. One of the real challenges that I think has kind of highlighted this this core problem, right? For 40 years, there's always been a show that with not enough tickets and a fan was unhappy. Obviously, in the last while, I think which kind of set the nuclear chaos on this on sale is the secondary business. You think of what happens on those four or five big demand tours a year, that passionate fan, which is the hallmark of our business, thank god, fans are passionate. They're more passionate about the artist's relationship than they are sports or anything else. They're committed, and they want to see that artist at all costs. Now what's happening is you announce an on sale. I think Irving said it famously yesterday. We haven't announced the U2 on sale yet. We haven't announced when the dates will play. But secondary sites have U2 dates up with tickets on sale. So the consumer on these high demand on sales has really over the last couple of years, started to get pissed off and doesn't understand the process. Why are there so many tickets on spec selling sites? Why is 10 o'clock if I didn't get a ticket, are there five pages of scalper sites selling tickets for 5 times to face value. Ticketmaster, you must have given them tickets. This must – this doesn't seem fair. And that's kind of the digital ticket going online to add then a SeatGeek, StubHub, Vivid, the big scalpers with all of their ways of getting tickets before, after that's really highlighted, right? That's really become a new thing over the last few years that the consumers could see now online. They don't understand why they couldn't get a ticket and why there's so many tickets on secondary. So I think that's the part that we've got to now really lean in on that. We did that today with the Fair Act. I would tell you, yesterday, sitting at the industry conference at Polestar, if any of you want to hear the panel between Irvin, Garth Brooks, Jim Dolan and the DOJ ex-employee. I think it was fabulous because I think it really shows a united music industry in that conference yesterday was venue, promoters, managers, agents and artists. And I would say it was the most excited and most united I've ever seen them in the sense of we've got to now stand up as an industry. Artists historically have not been great at lobbying together and really the only lobbyists that exists is the Ticket Broker Association, they've done a good job. But I would say yesterday, that room was lit up that the artist and fan relationship and that books a moment when he sat out there and said, "When I want to charge a certain price for a ticket, I don't want someone in the middle making money off my IP, I want to deliver that ticket to my fan at my price". So I think we've been too passive in our approach on how we need to educate and act. This week was the start of where we're going to start moving. You're going to see us lean forward a lot more on education reform. And then ultimately, the part that matters the most is just being better at our products. We still are the best at the game right now. We're the only ones that have developed Verified Fan products to try to stock the secondary box. We're going to get better and better at that. We're going to be more transparent. We're going to do some new products on the Live Nation venue side that will lead the industry. So I think you'll see this year a lot more action from our side pushing back, leaning forward and ultimately better products with the artist. But I would tell you if there's one place you want to be standing right now is where we are. We work for the artist, they're very united behind us. We're doing a fabulous job for them. Scalpers have done a great job of hijacking the narrative. Obviously, when [indiscernible] start witness as the CEO of SeatGeek, we’ve not done a good job. We're going to move forward this year much more aggressive telling the artist side of the story. I think FAIR Act today is a good start at that.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And then for Joe, just on the quarter, the sponsorship AOI margin was a little lower than we normally see. I think there were some festivals and amp shows that had got scheduled later. So wondering if there was a mix factor there. And then just free cash flow conversion for the year, I think it was like 10% higher than you had expected? Wondering if you could just walk through the drivers of that and how sustainable that might be? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I think, obviously we finished up a fantastic year. As I've told you guys in the past, I don't overly read too much in this quarter specific comparisons. You've got a lot of moving pieces. We obviously had some changes in the business with the addition of OCESA, a lot of impact last year. Timing of APAC closed most of the year. Europe only opened in the second half. So it was really just some timing shifts, nothing to read particularly into it or to read as a go-forward indication on the margin side. And then as you said, yes, our free cash flow came in very strong as the conversion to AOI. I think a little higher than expected, in part, just the overall AOI level, gave us some leverage on that. And then just some of the below the line pieces were a bit lower than what we expected. So I think we outperformed last year on that free cash flow conversion.
David Karnovsky: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: Hey. Great, thank you. Maybe on the demand front for Michael. Thanks for the commentary on ticket sales being up 20% year-over-year on a global basis so far this year. I was hoping you could maybe expand on that a little bit by talking more about what you're seeing in demand so far through February, particularly in markets that were opened this time last year, I think like the U.S., Canada and maybe parts of Europe? As consumer pricing trends remain stable versus what you saw last year as growth accelerated or decelerated, especially now lapping some of the reopening benefits that we saw in 2022?
Michael Rapino: So thanks Stephen.
Joe Berchtold: I'll start.
Michael Rapino: Go ahead Joe.
Joe Berchtold: I'll just start with some of the numbers and then Michael can fill in with some color. So as Michael said, we're up 20% this year relative to where we were at this point last year. That's even with last year having the benefit of all those rescheduled shows, which totaled around 20 million fans. About 20 million fans got rescheduled. We think half of those would have happened last year anyway, but that means that 20% growth comp is against an inflated number, if you will. So the actual growth even stronger than that. As we noted in the release – within that international is up around 25%, which would mean that North America is still up high teens. So very good growth. If you look just at the ticket sales sold in January through mid-February this year on a global basis, we've sold roughly twice the number of tickets as we sold last year. So even looking at the most recent activity continues to be very robust globally.
Michael Rapino: Yes. And my commentary is similar. We are just amazed at the resilience of the customer this year. I think we all lived the November air pocket thesis and everyone's view on was 2022 an exception to the rule. Could we keep growing? Where was the customer? Was it just a bubble? We see nothing but strong growth demand everywhere in the world right now. We're up right now with stadiums in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, all of our festivals are outperforming last year around the world. Our clubs and theaters are doing well. Our on-site spend in most of those clubs and theaters we see tracking in the right direction. We'd always – in this business, you always worry about the first – the superstars are going to sell out, and then how is the rest of the business do? That's kind of the meeting the potatoes of our business. How the amphitheater shows? How is all the middle stuff going to do? And we're just seeing incredible strength right now across the board on our festivals, our big festivals or niche festivals, our theaters, clubs, we think this is going to be a continual buyer, consumers, as we said. Still look at concerts, let's zoom out again as we always do, let's forget about the 3% of shows that are going to consume political tweaks. 97% of that shows are very affordable for consumers. We're still incredibly affordable option for fans to go have a memorable night out, much more affordable than concerts. I said to Joe earlier, we absolutely have done a bad job on PR because the Super Bowl, it was a badge of honor that tickets were $5,000 or $6,000 each, and most people couldn't attain it. But concerts are still incredibly cheap overall experience versus a best ball game, a dinner, a night out or a theme park. So we think that plays in. We haven't seen any pullback. We've seen more demand top to bottom on a global basis. We think that will rise through this year.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. And then maybe one more on regulation for Joe. You recently made a pretty notable hire on the legal front. Could you talk a little bit about the rationale for that hire and maybe update us on where you stand in the process for any potential investigation with the DOJ?
Joe Berchtold: So we're delighted. We hired Dan Wall, for those of you who didn't see it, joined us formally following his retirement from Latham at the end of January. This is actually a conversation Dan and I started in May of 2019 at BottleRock. So Dan was planning on retiring from Latham, found working with us to be an exciting, fun business. And we talked that in 2020, he was going to announced his retirement, retire at the end of 2020, come join us. Like so many other people's plans, those got upended. So he didn't end up retiring until January, but this has been something that's been in the works now for three years that Dan wanted to do. He'll be instrumental in terms of our ongoing discussion. He's been in non-stop dialogue with the DOJ. It seems like for the past 13 years. He understands exactly the questions they asked their motivations. He just put together an op-ed piece that everybody should certainly read that was in Polestar today laying out on a fact basis as opposed to so many analysts and pundits that people refer to making broad statements about the DOJ, their process, the consent decree, risks of us being broken up. I think he does a fantastic job of laying out in very specific detail why so many of those beliefs are unfounded and I think creates a little higher requirement for people that are going to talk that way to need to disprove what he lays out there as opposed to generally speculating.
Stephen Laszczyk: Okay. Thank you for that.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Glagola: Yes. Thank you. Building off what you said earlier, Michael, about one of your main ticketing competitors testifying against you. Just in light of the Fair Ticketing Act, do you think there's any political will in United States to allow for primary ticketing players like Live Nation to help artists utilize their digital ticketing technology to impose controls on the resale of ticket?
Michael Rapino: Well, I believe that the artist has the best shot when they unite around their IP. I don't think – there is – the U.S. is probably about the only country in the world that doesn't have some level of regulation. I mean most other countries walk up and said, "Geez, if the artist wants to charge $300 an underpriced product for the fan to get a cheaper ticket why would a middleman be able to make $1,000. It doesn't seem logical, right? So most IP, if you look at the artist, you wouldn't be able to look, think about how much work Netflix is doing on password sharing just to save $7.99. So I think there's a lot of pent-up artists who are underpriced their product every day. I mean we're pretty much the only product in the world that's worth more of the second it's sold. I think they've done that for the betterment of their fan base. And like everyone else, they've seen now the sunlight online of the abuse that's been taken on their IP. So I like our position. I like stand up with the artist. I think the artists, Irving, you saw it yesterday with Garth. I do believe that the artist will have more control of their ticket like the PROJAM [ph] model they should. That doesn't mean that you are not going to transfer the tickets. We believe in tickets should have a fair exchange platform, and you should be able to exchange and sell tickets. And if an artist doesn't care about secondary then great, let the – the rush will then will move. If you do care and you want to limit it, you want to cap it at 30%, 20%. I just think that the artist since they're making the decision on how to underprice their product for the betterment of the fan should have a seat at saying, well, how does it go to market? Because we don't want the artist to continually say, well, I'm just going to charge $5,000 then, that's not better for the fan to charge market. So if they're going to charge under market, I believe that they should have a say in it. I do believe they'll be very persuasive over time with lawmakers when that story is presented. As you know, the secondary are running around trying to make sure that the second – tickets are freely transferred so they can sell them. I think that the good news in all of that's gone on in the last while, don't let a crisis go unused. I think that this has created a lot of great news as painful as it is for us some days. The bottle got on – the genie's out of the bottle. We were kind of suppressed on the back foot, not wanting to talk out loud too much about a lot of this business while we service our customers. I think the champagne bottle has been popped. I think artists I thought yesterday was very unique. I think you're going to see – we've been all sleeping, while the scalpers have done a fabulous job lobbying. I think they got woken up yesterday and recently. And I think the artist and the venue, remember have a big stake in this, right, especially sports. So I think the sports teams, sports leagues, content owners in general, like any other industry. May Kim was very clear yesterday. He talks a lot about the artist IP. We think that's a very valid position. We think that the artist or the content owner will be able to have more control on how and when they want to sell their tickets, and I think that's a big step forward.
Stephen Glagola: Thanks Michael for that. And Joe, I just had one on your CapEx spend for 2023 to $450 million. So one-third of that on maintenance CapEx implies flat with 2019 and then two-thirds implies 50% growth, I think, above 2022 levels, 82% growth above 2019 levels. Can you just provide some more color here on what those investments are? Is this in the Venue Nation business? And then any color on the hurdle rate you guys factor into this capital spend would be appreciated? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. A lot of the growth is certainly in the Venue Nation side. As you can imagine in 2020 and 2021, we had a substantial amount of deferred CapEx that we then do that the building is needed. Then in 2022, we were faced with a lot of supply chain constraints had to prioritize where to use the scarce resources that we were able to get. So that was a limiting factor. So there's some catch-up on the maintenance side of it. The return is really more of a rev gen side than a maintenance side. Most of the maintenance is required for continuing operation, health and safety issues. On the growth side, we have return requirements that are well above our cost of capital, haven't given specific ones, differs a bit by project, whether it's a brand-new project or it's just a – you're adding a new bar at a venue. So those are opportunities that we just think are continuing to present themselves as we expand the global footprint.
Stephen Glagola: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Bazinet: I just had a question on Concert's AOI per fan. I know you called out some of the headwinds, reopening costs, inflation for the venues you own and said it would get better. But can you just sort of frame what a reasonable AOI per fan is? I think it was $1.40 this year and maybe $2.50 or something back in 2019?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I don't think Concerts AOI per fan is a logical way to look at it, Jason. I think if you look at how we've talked about our business, we've talked about our business across the multiple pieces. So you have to look at it, what's the concerts plus sponsorship plus ticketing AOI per fan, which we've grown – and what we've said is that the concert business has been hit by some of these cost increases, supply chain constraints, increased costs on some of the inputs, but we've increased the overall profitability per fan both by executing on site with those fans coming to our venues, but then also by dramatically increasing our sponsorship per fan and by growing some of our ticketing revenue per fan, including the non-service fee side. So we look at it more holistically, recognizing there are going to be some puts and takes in a given year, certainly on the business.
Jason Bazinet: Can I just follow up? Because it's...
Michael Rapino: But also just I want to give some color there. Just to remind everyone, when we sat here a year ago, we didn't think we were going to be open in the summer. We had no staff. We ran 100 miles an hour to get open for May, hire 20,000 staff, every tour, concert couldn't find trust double cost for generators. I mean, we were running hard last year. Overpaying staff, suppliers, getting the show back together was tough last year. We still obviously delivered incredible numbers, but we're now back to that 2019 level of staff in place, costs have all come down, suppliers are all back in line, generators are normal cost. So we do obviously expect 2023 to be in terms of a cost basis back to a continual normal business.
Jason Bazinet: Can I just ask 1 follow-up? Do you think the right way to look at it is that there's some sort of permanent shift in profit pools towards sponsorship and advertising and ticketing and away from concerts? In other words...
Joe Berchtold: I think it's premature to say that. I mean let me give you another just piece on what hit us last year with concerts was we had those. I talked about the 20 million fans for shows that got rescheduled. Those are shows that went on sale in 2019 or early 2020, and we're priced at the price level for those shows back then. Fast forward a couple of years later, nobody was repricing the rescheduled shows, and yet the market particularly for the best tickets and moved up substantially. So in 2022, you were operating a pretty good chunk of your business with a 2019, 2020 revenue stream against the 2022 cost structure. That's not going to replicate itself. That was a one-time unusual event. So I think you got to take a beat, let this year play out before you draw in a conclusion off of a single data point.
Jason Bazinet: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the floor back over to the management team for closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everyone.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 17:00:00) =====

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Live Nation delivered the biggest summer concert season in history that drove a record quarter. These results demonstrate the ongoing and increasing demand for live events globally, with attendance at events of all sizes from clubs to stadiums. Fans around the world continue prioritizing their spend on live events, particularly concerts. Despite varying economic headwinds, including inflation, we have not seen any pullback in demand as on-sales on-site spending, advertising, all other operating metrics continue showing strong year-on-year growth. With this demand, revenue was up over 60% relative to 2019 with each division up at least 30% and AOI up 45% to $621 million, with all divisions up at least 25%. As we expected, our performance this quarter was led by our concert business, which held 11,000 concerts to 44 million fans across 50 countries. As a result, we generated over $5 billion of revenue and $281 million AOI for the quarter, up 67% and 44% respectively relative to 2019 Q3. Shows of all types continue having strong demand with double-digit attendance growth across all venue types, including clubs, theaters, amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Stadiums had a particularly strong quarter with fan count more than tripling to nearly 9 million fans driven by the global demand of the top acts across a number of genres and audiences such as Bad Bunny, The Weeknd and Red Hot Chili Peppers. We delivered double-digit attendance growth across established and emerging markets around the globe from North America to Europe to South America showing our long runway of global growth. Our Venue Nation division hosted more fans with attendance up 14% relative to 2019 to $19 million for the quarter and 38 million fans year-to-date. Based on our current pacing, we expect to host more than 50 million fans at our Venue Nation and Festival division. As we have grown attendance, we have also continued driving greater market pricing for our concerts and now expect to transfer over $550 million of additional payments to artists this year, continuing our effort to help artists get the full value from their shows. And over the course of the summer, we continue to see strong onsite spend with no reduction in consumer buying habits. Ancillary per fan spending was up 20% to 30% year-to-date in our operated venues across the U.S. and Europe. The consistent theme is that fans are eager to enhance their experience, but we continue elevating our hospitality operations to provide more premium options. We still have tremendous room to expand these high-quality experiences throughout our venue portfolio, which includes over 400 venues and festivals globally, with almost 40 new venues in the pipeline. Fan demand for live events was also clear in our ticketing business. We transacted $6.7 billion of fee-generating GTV on 71 million tickets, up 69% and 42% respectively relative to 2019. This demand remained strong throughout the quarter as 2 of the 3 months were amongst the top 10 transacted GTV, excluding refund months ever. At this point, all top 10 months occurred within the past year. GTV growth was strong across both primary and secondary, up 61% and 132% respectively. Concerts were up 80% of the growth in primary GTV, while concerts and sports together accounted for over 90% of our secondary growth. Globally, new venue clients continue to seek out Ticketmaster’s service due to its effectiveness of our enterprise software platform, driving venue revenue, combined with our leading online marketplace. As a result, we contracted 19 million net new tickets so far this year on a global basis. At Ticketmaster, we continue to advocate for fee transparency and live event ticketing. We advocated for all-in pricing mandate passed in New York early this year, which requires face value prices and fees to be shown upfront. And so we support the FTC mandating this nationally. We operate ticketing marketplaces in more than 30 countries around the world and have seen all-in pricing adopted successfully in many countries when mandated across the board. It only works with all ticketing marketplaces adopt together and the consumers truly can accurately compare as they shop for tickets. Sponsorship had its biggest quarter ever, following our previous record last quarter, driven by the strength of our festival and online partnerships. Our performance drove AOI of $226 million, 56% higher in 2019. Our sponsorship revenue growth has been broad-based with North America up 48% and international up 93% and we see strong demand both on-site and online, up 64% and 63% respectively this year. And our unique theater live events platforms continue to attract new brands and expand relationships with current partners. Festival sponsorship has been our largest growth driver to-date as we have effectively leveraged record festival attendance this year and compounded this growth with double-digit increases in per fan sponsorship. Platform integrations have been a great growth driver with online partnerships. As we continue to drive value and monetize opportunities via Ticketmaster’s purchase process with non-service fee revenues, up double-digits relative to 2019. Clearly, 2022 has been an incredible year of returning to live events and we expect to finish strong. Ticket sales for concerts this year were up 34% for the quarter and now stand at 115 million tickets sold for the shows this year, up 37%. And more importantly, momentum is strong with early signs pointing to continued growth in 2023 across our businesses. Ticket sales for shows in 2023 are pacing even stronger than they were heading into 2022, up double-digits year-over-year, excluding sales from rescheduled shows. In our sponsorship business, confirmed commitments for 2023 are up 30% from this time last year, showing the resiliency and long-term commitments that brands have for our business. Beyond these specific leading indicators, going into 2023, we expect we will drive growth in our concert business by adding more venues to our portfolio, continued increase in ancillary per fan revenue and furthering our efforts to deliver market value for the shows to the artists. And in ticketing, we expect to also benefit from these market pricing trends while continuing to globally add new clients to our world class platform. With that, I will turn it over to Joe.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael and good afternoon everyone. As with last quarter, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results. So, most of our discussion will be relative to Q3 of 2019. For the company, our reported revenue of $6.2 billion for the quarter was $2.4 billion better than Q3 2019 or an increase of 63%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $6.4 billion for the quarter. So, there was roughly a 3% impact due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This was a record quarter for revenue for the second quarter in a row and bested our Q2 figure by 39%. And our reported AOI of $621 million for the quarter was $194 million better than 2019, up 45% and led by an improvement of over $86 million in concerts and $81 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our Q3 AOI was $645 million. The FX impact of negative $24 million or 4% was largely driven by the devaluation of the euro and the pound. And year-to-date, we have converted roughly 76% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $996 million. Let me give a bit more color on each division then I will give you more on leading indicators. First, in concerts, our AOI was $281 million for the quarter, which compares to $194 million in Q3 of 2019, an improvement of 44%. U.S. concert’s strongest quarter ever far surpassing the previous record of $200 million AOI in Q3 of 2018. It was a stellar summer season for concerts. We had over 44 million fans in the quarter, the most ever, growing 40% compared to Q3 of 2019 when we had close to 32 million fans. Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics, stadium attendance more than tripled to 8.7 million fans in Q3 of this year and festival attendance was 6.5 million fans in the quarter, up nearly 40% from Q3 of 2019 with premier events, including Rock in Rio, Rock Werchter, Reading and Lollapalooza. Pricing has been a key part of our strategy in 2022 capturing market pricing for the best tickets while maintaining an affordable entry point for all fans. For tickets sold to shows at our amphitheaters, arenas and stadiums globally this year, front-of-house pricing increased for each by double-digits relative to 2019, while starting prices for all shows in the U.S. rose just 6% and remain under $35 on average. And giving you more details on ancillary per fan revenue by venue type in our U.S. amphitheaters, ancillary per fan revenue was $38, an increase of $8 per fan over 2019 levels or close to 30% growth. At our major festivals globally, increased spending on concessions, camping and VIP experiences drove ancillary per fan revenue up by nearly 30%. And that our theaters and clubs in the U.S. and the UK, ancillary per fan revenue increased by over 20%, driven by higher concession sales, fast lane entry, night of show upgrades and the move to cashless payments. On the cost side, as indicated before, increases continue to impact this primarily in the venues we operate, amphitheaters, theaters and clubs and festivals. But in all cases, we are delivering double-digit growth in profitability per fan due to increased ticket sales and ancillary revenue. Next, ticketing had another successful quarter, delivering $163 million in AOI, nearly 30% higher than Q3 of 2019. Q3 was our top quarter ever in terms of reported ticket sales in GTV and it was our second highest quarter ever in terms of transacted ticket sales in GTV behind only Q2 of this year. When we look at the year-to-date performance of our ticketing business, the numbers reflect the incredible demand we have had. Through September 30, we have sold 197 million fee-bearing tickets, up 38 million tickets or 24% compared to 2019. GTV for the first 9 months is $19 billion, up $6.3 billion or 49% compared to 2019. As a result, revenues are close to $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of the year, which is up almost $500 million or 45% compared to 2019. And with all this, we drove AOI to $600 million, up 71% as we deliver strong operating leverage. Across both sporting and concert events, ticket buyers continue to prioritize purchasing the best seats available, driving a 17% average price increase in the primary market year-to-date relative to 2019. Secondary pricing has risen by 10% on average with sales volume up as well. With these increases, the average secondary ticket price in the U.S. remains almost twice that of a primary ticket, demonstrating additional opportunities for market-based pricing as well as a large buffer from any demand shifts. For those of you focused on margins, as we have indicated previously, it’s difficult to evaluate based on a single quarter. Q3 margins were impacted by our mix of clients and shows, along with technology investments. All of this is as expected and in line with our full year margin expectations in the high-30s as we have been indicating over the past few quarters. Finally, growth in our high-margin sponsorship business continued this quarter, with revenue up 59% relative to Q3 2019 and now up 64% year-to-date. We once again had high growth in both onsite and online sponsorship, driving record Q3 AOI of $226 million, 56% higher than our Q3 2019 AOI. Looking back at sponsorship’s growth through the first 9 months, we have seen our festival business nearly double and our platform integrations more than double. Our strategic multiyear multi-asset sponsors now generate $0.75 billion in revenue for us. Back in 2017, we had 56 such clients, representing approximately two-thirds of our total sponsorship revenue. Today, that number has grown to over 100 such partners that account for 80% of our revenue, growth in both the number of partners and the level of their spend, which demonstrates the value we deliver and the importance they place on our unique on-site and online scale platforms. As we look to the remainder of 2022, starting with our leading indicators through late October, all relative to 2019, concert ticket sales are over 115 million tickets for events this year, up 37% and 20% higher than our full year 2019 fan count. Second, Ticketing has sold over 200 million primary fee-bearing tickets for events this year, up 27% relative to 2019 at this point. Of these, 135 million tickets are for concert events, which is 38% higher than 2019. Related to this, we had $1.9 billion in event-related deferred revenue, consistent with our levels in Q3 of 2021, despite the deferred shows in last year’s numbers. Excluding the deferred shows from last year’s numbers, we would be up 35% year-on-year. A few other points on 2022, given our presence in the UK and mainland Europe, we have experienced FX headwinds. And through the end of September, our AOI has been negatively impacted by $47 million. This was almost entirely in the second and third quarters as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the euro and British pound. Based on current forward rates, we expect a 4% impact to AOI in the final quarter of this year. Due to some delays in construction projects as a result of supply chain disruptions, our 2022 capital expenditures forecast is now approximately $300 million, with roughly two-thirds allocated to revenue-generating projects. We expect the key revenue-generating projects, which are delayed, will still be completed early next year. So don’t anticipate any impact next year on the return from these projects. We expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be in the mid to high 50s for the full year. We ended Q3 with $2.6 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate, and our average cost of debt is roughly 4.5% positioning us well in this interest rate environment. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated with only our 2023 convertible debt maturing within the next 2 years. We will continue to optimize our capital structure based on market conditions. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Brandon Ross: Hey, everyone. At this point, most investor focus is on 2023. So I wanted to dig a little more there. And I know it’s hard to determine the demand side for the full year. But can you speak maybe quantitatively and qualitatively about the supply side for next year? I think last year, you gave that kind of top touring apps for the year ahead and what that looked like year-over-year. How is that trending? And then what’s your view on the quality of the supply next year versus this current year?
Michael Rapino: I’ll start on the quality. We’re seeing a really good pipe for next year. I would say there would be no difference in ‘23 to ‘22 in terms of quality. If you were a stadium act, a large selling arena act, you probably debated whether you went out in ‘22 or you went out in ‘23. So, lots of great artists in the pipe from clubs to stadiums to arenas. It will look like a similar year in terms of quality.
Brandon Ross: Second piece. So...
Joe Berchtold: Yes and – just a few other specifics. As Michael said, our sales for next year are up double digits. I mean if you want to take these three so-called quality references, we’re most up in stadiums which, by their definition are going to be the largest artists that can sell the most tickets. So that would indicate we are off to a good quality start. The other is if we look at tickets sold per show that we have on sale for next year from amps, arenas, stadiums, festivals in all cases, our tickets sold at the on sales are up relative to what they were at this point last year for 2022 shows. So I think those are all good indicators of both the breadth and the depth of the supply that’s going out.
Brandon Ross: Great. And then keeping on ‘23, you said your book sponsorship is, I think, up 30% year-over-year. And that’s kind of a different story than we’re hearing across the ad and sponsorship universe. Have you seen any recent slowdown there? And why generally do you think your trends in Sponsorship are different than what we’re seeing?
Joe Berchtold: No. We haven’t seen any slowdown. I think it’s different pools of money from strategy. The Sponsorship relationships with us are not decided week-to-week, month-to-month based on what they are trying to get out of performance marketing. These are long-term commitments by major brands. Michael gave you the stats. It’s really being driven by these big multiyear, multi-asset, multimillion-dollar relationships. So we’re up 30% with over half our book of business for next year already filled and not seeing a slowdown. So we’re feeling very comfortable with it.
Michael Rapino: Brandon, for comparison, the – if the NFL was a public company or NBA, I’m sure that would be reporting record sponsorship also. So we kind of put us off from that league, right? He’s not having any pullback. If you’ve got a scarce commodity like a beyond state tour or an NFL game, those are still very rare pieces of business that you want to be associated with, and they have longevity to them. So we haven’t seen any slowdown talking to the NBA and NFL. We haven’t seen it over there either. So I think those are the comparables for you.
Brandon Ross: Okay. And then just finally, on the regulatory front, there is noise is kind of there always is. What would – I know you went on the offensive on the Ticketing transparency, but what would be the fallout if there are changes to that law for you? And is there any other potential pressure, regulatory pressure that you’re seeing or otherwise contending with right now?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. We don’t believe there will be any impact whatsoever if there was a nationwide mandate for all-in pricing. We think it makes sense. It just has to be done collectively at the same time. And if you look back and you listen to the comments, the comments were all about transparency, which is really all-in pricing. The commentary was not about fee levels or any of the other issues that some people have brought up. That’s been looked at, and we feel comfortable with what our business model is in that regard. So I think that we will work with the FTC. We will work with the DA in the State of New York, and we’re very supportive of that and some other shifts to make ticketing more transparent and a better consumer experience.
Michael Rapino: Just a couple of points to jump on, we tend to do better as regulation comes into play in this space. A lot of our business has been chasing the secondary business for years that’s kind of unregulated. We would love spec selling to be outlawed. We’d love better rules on bot ticketing. We love all-in pricing. We’re adhering to all-in pricing in New York right now. I think we’re probably the only ticketing company actually adhering to those regulations right now. So we like sunlight coming to the business. The most part of the business that’s been unregulated and most of the noise is generated from the secondary business. So we love regulation, puts us on an equal footing ground. Right now, in our secondary business, we don’t do spec selling. That’s probably 30% to 40% of what inventory sits on secondary sites. We don’t price below face value. So we actually operate at a disadvantage right now because we are operating in a higher standard. So we had a lot more transparency. We’d love to have the fees more transparent upfront, all-in pricing. We just have to make sure everybody plays by the same rules, but we’re going to lead those pieces. As far as the fees, just to remind you, it’s the venues that set the fee and take most of the fees. So I think if you bought – if you build a multi-hundred million arena or a stadium, I think your prerogative to decide what is the fee you want to charge on your sports and music tickets. We get a piece of that, but those are set by the venue and monetized by the venue. So just kind of some of the ongoing transparencies of the business, we’ve got to do a better job explaining.
Brandon Ross: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: Thanks. Maybe I’ll flip Brandon’s first question around and push on the demand side. But you’ve been able to maintain AOI growth in a low double-digit range over a long period. And you’ve done that in markets even a time for fan attendance has been down. And I know you just spoke to the supply, but given that uncertain demand environment, how do you think about some of the other factors in your control on revenue or cost that can kind of keep you in that historical range?
Michael Rapino: I’m going to let Joe jump in, but I just want to make sure, don’t discount the supply side, right? That’s like talking to Disney and saying, if you only have Marvel movies, how is your demand going to be? It’s going to be great. Supply and content drives the demand. So if you’ve got a lot of great, great quality supply, the demand is a little easier. So I don’t want you to discount that. We’re very proud that we work with the best artists in the world. We have the best global platform for those artists and attractive to our platform. That’s what you have to make sure you first have. So we have the blockbusters top to bottom. That’s going to drive the demand. Now Joe will take over in terms of explaining the demand strength so far we’ve seen.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. So again, just to – I mean, to repeat the numbers, which are the mix of supply and demand, which is that our tickets sold for the shows that we have on sale for next year are up consistently across all venue types relative to a year ago. So the demand is absolutely coming for the supply that’s showing up. Now on a broader basis, you’re right, we’ve consistently – if you looked at 2010 to 2019, we’ve consistently grown our business double-digit AOI. In 2011, we grew our business double-digit AOI while fan attendance was down. So we do have a number of other levers, and Michael spoke to those as part of his commentary. We’re continuing to grow our venue base. And fans that shows in our venues are much more profitable than others. We continue to have increased on-site spend. We continue to have pricing as a lever, which drives through both our concerts business and our ticketing business continuing to add globally Ticketmaster clients. And then I’ve given you the numbers on Sponsorship, which we think continues to be a double-digit growth business into the future. So all of those levers on top of the supply-demand dynamic is what gives us confidence as we continue to look to our future of the growth potential.
Michael Rapino: And Joe, I just want to jump in on the demand in terms of how the demand is spread. There is certain thesis as they like to get spread. Our demand is – overall concert ticket is still a really affordable ticket. Most majority of the tickets are sold are $50 to $75. So, although we have a great premium business that does attract a high-end customer or someone that’s a rapid fan, our business is split from clubs to theaters to stadiums, we’re seeing demand strong on all levels. Whether it’s a $19 ticket, it’s filling up the clubs or the premium at the stadiums and arenas. So we do think we have something for everyone. It is a very accessible ticket even in a pull back time. And we’re seeing that the demographic of our buyer is very, very wide and split across all sizes.
Joe Berchtold: Yes, Michael, sorry, just to jump back in on you. Again, counter to some of the commentary that I’ve heard out there were also – we’re not dependent on acts that have been around for a long time. If you look at how vibrant the new artists are – I mean, I look at our top artists we’ve had this year, the Harry Styles, Dua Lipas, Billy Eilish, Bad Bunny, Morgan Wallen, The Weeknd, Olivia Rodrigo. These are all artists that are at the early stages of their career. Across, as Michael talked about, all genres, most of those are obviously in arenas and stadiums, but these are tremendous talents that are just showing the breadth of supply that we have in our business.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And then I had a question on online sponsorship, which is really strong in the quarter. How do we think about the driver of growth here in terms of band or traffic increases on your website or apps versus actions which are more in your control, like the platform integration, as you mentioned? And then how much kind of room is there to grow some of these sponsorships?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. Our focus this year has obviously been on the latter of how do we create new assets on this Ticketmaster platform that can continue to drive the economics. And then as you improve your volume of tickets or improve your site visits, the math is just additional growth on top of that. So, we feel like we would view any other platform we own in its own way just a counterpart to the on-site. We have people’s attention through a period of time. We have them going through a purchase process. And all of that is something that we can monetize. We saw a great progress on the platform integrations, particularly around the checkout this year. We think there is earlier upstream. We think there is advertising dollars that can still be significant that we can drive from it. And we are focused much more on how do we use Ticketmaster as a platform to drive its own set of non-service fee revenue streams. And we think that has a long runway.
David Karnovsky: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: Hey. Great. Thank you. Maybe one for Michael on pricing, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the advice you are giving to most artists with respect to pricing their concerts next year. Is your messaging more that maybe there is still some opportunity to take price, given the strong demand that you are seeing this year, or is maybe at ‘23 is a year where artists need to be a little bit more focused on selling out rather than taking price?
Michael Rapino: Yes. I wouldn’t say ‘23 – our conversation is any different than it’s been in any year. We have an incredible – great pricing team, a lot of data scientists that are talking and analyzing the business with our managers and agents. So, as you know, there is no one paint brush, depending on what artists – where you are in your cycle and what your demand is. So, I just saw some counts this morning for Shenoy [ph] went up, up-sell. Today, big, big numbers out of the box. She is an iconic artist. So, you are not worried about pricing if you are talking to Shenoy and how she prices her tour, if you are a little baby going on tour next year. You have a younger demo, you are building your audience, maximizing your growth isn’t your priority. It’s getting to as many markets and fans as you can. So, I wouldn’t say ‘23 is even in my buyers’ minds right now. What is in their head is over the last few years, it’s just better pricing dynamic strategy from day one on the market. Price is different on a Friday than a Tuesday, the aisle seat’s worth more than the middle. The front is always underpriced. We have yet to see anything get close to secondary demand yet. So, most of our shows are still going to be underpriced in the front. So, our job is to do what we can up-sell the front, so we can lower the price in the back, get sell-through all the way through. So, I wouldn’t say that any artist or manager is having any panic of talking to me about demand for next year. They know the Taylor Swift ticket Verified Fan that went up this week that’s probably going to break all records. I mean artists are seeing the demand is there. If you price it smart, you have got the right markets. You have been out of the market maybe 3 years, 4 years. We are not feeling the demand from inflation or ‘23 pressures that are driving strategy. It’s just overall us being better at what we do today than we were last year and the year before on pricing strategy per market by artist for territory.
Stephen Laszczyk: Got it. That’s helpful. And then perhaps somewhat related to that, secondary GTV grew more than twice as fast as primary GTV in the third quarter, could you just comment on some of the key factors driving that outsized growth in secondary? And is this something you think you can continue in light of the pricing strategy you outlined?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I think as Michael will talk to you, first and foremost, our strategy is to help ours get paid market value for their show. And we are spending more and more on having the people and the data to help them do that. That said, for a lot of reasons that he went over around how they want to build their fan base, how they want to build their brands, they are leaving money on the table. And we are continuing to see that just almost insatiable demand in the secondary market. I talked about average price of a secondary ticket is still almost twice that of a primary ticket. So, that continues to grow, and we continue to price a little bit trying to catch up to that. So, we don’t see the secondary market going away anytime soon, and we are going to be active participants. And I talked, I think last quarter about the fact that we believe the shift to secondary tickets has helped us because it’s just eliminated friction to use us as the secondary platform to buy and sell the tickets. As we get better and better with that Ticketmaster app, you can manage your tickets, you can sell them, you can buy them on our secondary. As all of that gets easier and easier, I think that just naturally continues to build the business with us.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Glagola: Hi. Thanks for the question. Michael and Joe, can you maybe just update us on – and I know you spoke earlier around the regulatory risk and concerns around – on FTC regulation and all-in pricing. But I think there is also investor concerns around the DoJ still. And maybe just update us where things stand with your consent decree? And maybe also touching on in relation to that, client wins on ticketing have been very strong over the last 21 months, 36 million in tickets. So, maybe the competitiveness of the primary ticketing market in the United States and how you see that relative to those wins and with regards to regulation? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: As regards to the consent decree, we have an ongoing discussion. We have an external monitor who we have regular dialogue with. We have an internal monitor who oversees everything. We are very happy that we have got an active dialogue now, which is what was lacking in the first 10 years post our merger. We feel good about all of those discussions. I don’t think there is anything structural, substantive that we are finding that’s inconsistent with the message that we send all of our people, which is these are independent decisions on promotion and ticketing and the two shouldn’t be tied together. So, we feel good about that process that we have with them. As we look at Ticketmaster, I think it’s continuing to be successful because it’s a very effective platform. I think if you look at – again, we have talked a lot over the past few quarters about because of our continually improving in high-quality platform, both for the enterprise side as well as the customer side, particularly internationally, that’s differentiated and driving a lot of wins internationally. North America, where it’s more a mature market, you need to be able to compete on price in addition to features. And I think our business has shown that we can continue to scale that, grow it and do so very profitably.
Stephen Glagola: Thanks Joe. And if – I just have one more follow-up here. On industry publications, have reported a trend of tickets for top-tier act seen strong demand and then the lesser known and emerging artists are struggling. I know you had some commentary today where that wasn’t the case. But as you look out over the next 12 months or so, does that – are you seeing that potentially an impact on your business or a trend? And maybe can you just talk about both of those segments of artists in a recessionary environment and how they would hold up the high-end top-tier acts relative to the emerging artists and lesser known ones? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: Yes. Just on a macro level, this is a business that overall we don’t win – most shows don’t sell out. Majority of your shows don’t sell out, always room for a few more tickets to be sold. So, although the press always talks about the expensive tickets or the sold-out ticket, that’s not your real business. Your real business is night and day, theater, clubs, amphitheaters, arenas, selling those tickets night by night. So, most tours ultimately do well in the end, artists make money and we make money. There are some tours a small percentage that just don’t sell enough ticket, the demand isn’t there. And the tour that gets canceled or the promoter and the artist lose money. So, I have seen some of those publications where they want to grab those six tours or some that didn’t make money and then try to extrapolate something larger. So, I just don’t see that trend. We did over 8,000 club shows last year and 95% are going to make money and do well and the artists will deliver those 400 tickets or 1,100 tickets as they are building their business and their costs are associated with it. It was a tougher year for all of the industry as the supply chain challenges, labor, everyone getting back to work, getting the security guards, everyone’s costs were up this year. So, that would have affected all artists on the road relative to their revenue. But those seem to have worked their way through the system. So, I don’t see any trend that the emerging or younger artists are having any harder time than any young emerging artists when they are taking those risks building their businesses on the way up. Generally, majority are going to be okay in terms of selling enough tickets, paying the bills and building their business. So, we don’t see any trends in the bottom end, any new trends that would suggest that the club and the emerging artists space isn’t growing. There is more clubs opening up all the time, lots of demand in every market, lots of options for artists to play 500 seats, 1,000 seats. We just know from our venue portfolio on the demand on opening up and building theaters and clubs is bigger than ever. So, that demand wouldn’t be driven if the supply wasn’t there.
Stephen Glagola: Thank you, Michael. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Supino: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First on Taylor Swift, I just want to say with my 16-year-old daughter and I are signed up for the pre-sale, very much appreciate you support on the 15th of the month. Moving on, in the press release, you highlighted that growth in your concert business in ‘23 will come from adding more venues to your operating portfolio and increasing ancillary per fan revenue. So, we didn’t see any mention of fan growth. And then in the discussion today, we have obviously heard a lot of talk about a robust first half of ‘23. And so if you will forgive me kind of picking up this ‘23 topic, again, I would love to understand how much visibility the company has into the second half of the year. I think booking cycles for the big venues are six months to nine months out. So, that’s one question. And second one was just as strong as your fan growth has been this year, does this change how aggressively you might go out and invest in new venues, possibly larger ones, even ones outside of the country? Thanks so much.
Joe Berchtold: So, just technically, Peter, just to answer your first question, I think the way that we have laid out the story in the release and then Michael talked about it is, first, he talked about the fact that ticket sales are up. He talked about the sponsorship growth. And then he said, in addition to those, there are a number of other levers that we have to continue to grow the business. So, I don’t think he ever said anything that said we weren’t – the fan growth didn’t come into this. At this point, looking at ‘23, yes, we have got some of the stadiums we talked about high growth in arenas. Some of that’s booked. It’s still somewhat early for the second half of the year. But macro in terms of our pipeline for next year, it would account for more fans than we had going into this year. The hard part that we have is just sorting out because of the shows that were rescheduled, trying to figure out how many of those were naturally flown into this year versus not. But we are feeling very good about the attendance levels for next year. Michael will talk about the venues.
Michael Rapino: Yes. I think just on Joe’s point, we are excited to be sitting here. We knew the thesis that you could sell on was that there was an air pocket. We heard that comment a lot ‘23 was an exceptional year. And it was – ‘22, I mean been an exceptional year. The idea that we were able to grow this business for so long on our high-double digits on – high-single digits on our fan base and then to have a year like ‘22, you blow the doors off it, and now to be able to sit here and say, and we think we will still grow on top. We are very proud of our business and our outlook, given the headwinds and the size of the gains we had this year. So, we are looking into now beyond that and how we keep growing the business forward. Venues, I have laid out over the last year or 2 years, we think it’s a great business. We have 300 in our portfolio. It’s a great way to obviously maximize that live event fully when you are vertical. So, we like our global pipeline we have right now. We are seeing a lot of white space where our content can help drive that business case from arenas to amphitheaters to big ballrooms and theaters. So, you will continually see us adding as we have been over the last many years to that portfolio.
Peter Supino: Thanks Michael. Thanks Joe.
Operator: We have time for one final question from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Katz: Thanks for taking my question. In the past, you have talked about the evolution of digital ticketing. And I know there was some commentary, I believe in the spending to that end. An update on sort of how that’s progressed, where it is and what we might expect in the near-term and longer term would be helpful, please.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I think digital ticketing at this point is nearly ubiquitous in North America. It has grown rapidly internationally. It’s still a year or 2 years behind. I would expect this to be pretty much there sometime between next year and maybe the year after, just depending a bit by market. And as it’s gotten established, it’s already helped us in a number of areas. I talked about secondary a few minutes ago. So, we are seeing some direct benefits as we continue to improve the ability in terms of how fans manage their tickets. I think you will continue to see more products get added on to the app. They continue to improve what the fan – how the fans can manage their tickets. And then it sets us up for the advertising and up-sells that we have been talking about. And we now have enough scale. We started doing some things this year at scale, working with sponsors who want to deliver value on site to our fans, working with the concert side of the business to enable direct up-sells. And I think all of those features that come from having a direct connection to the people actually attending the shows will be a key focus for how we continue to drive our sponsorship business over the next few years.
David Katz: And there is a sort of clear quantifiable earnings benefit where the rubber meets the road from that, correct?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. And I think you see part of that as we talked about what is our non-Ticketmaster, what’s our non-service fee revenue that we are driving and the fact that, that’s up double digits from ‘19. This is all a part of that.
David Katz: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mike for closing comments.
End of Q&A:
Michael Rapino: Thank you everyone. We will see you at our Investor Day in Liberty in November. You can check our website for more details. Thank you.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. The second quarter confirmed that live entertainment industry is back globally and bigger than ever. Live Nation led this return and continues to deliver the best global network to support artists as they play shows for the fans around the world. Every key operating metric is at an all-time high as we promoted more concerts, had more fans attend shows, they spent more money, sold more tickets and enable brands to connect with fans at a scale we have never seen before. As a result, relative to 2019, with over a 40% increase in revenue to $4.4 billion and a 50% increase in AOI to $480 million. With most of the world fully reopened, it's clear that concerts remain a high priority for fans. Consumers are seeking out and spending more on experiences. And the growing demand for live music and events is driving our business to record levels, far outpacing any macro issues or cost increases. Momentum across our business has remained strong in recent months and weeks, and demand combined with the substantial concert pipeline gives us confidence in our ongoing growth this year and into 2023. During the second quarter, we promoted over 12,000 concerts for 33.5 million fans, each up over 20% relative to the second quarter of 2019. Of the over 6 million additional fans this quarter, 5 million of that growth came from international markets, driven by the addition of OCESA and the reopening of most global markets with particularly strong focus and demand through Europe and Latin America. Growth was broad-based with double-digit attendance increased at venues of all types, demonstrating strong demand for events at all sizes from large-scale stadiums and festivals, sentiment clubs and theaters. Even as show count and attendance grew, fans demonstrated their willingness to pay more for the best seats with the average price of a ticket for our concerts this year up 10% globally relative to 2019, which remains less in the U.S. inflation level over the period. At the same time, our average entry price for concerts remain affordable at $33, up only 5% from 2019. With market-based pricing being widely adopted by most tours, we expect to shift over 500 million from the secondary market to artists this year, continuing to support those who created the concert and ensuring they are benefiting from it. On the venue side of our concert business, we continue to build our portfolio of operated venues with an active pipeline of almost 30 new venues across the globe. We are seeing the benefit of operating more venues as a number of fans who attended shows in our owned and operated venues during the quarter was up 13% to over 14 million fans, and we expect that figure to reach over 50 million fans for the full year. And fans are spending more on site with average per fan revenue up 20% at each of our amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs relative to 2019, with the average per fan revenue at our amphitheaters this year at $38.50, up 30% relative to 2019. Our ticket business also demonstrated strong growth in the quarter, transacted fee-bearing ticket volume up 48% to 77 million tickets and transacted GTV up 76% to $7.3 billion, both relative to 2019. This is our highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, with April, May and June, accounting for three of our top five all-time fee-bearing months. 75% of this growth came from concerts, another indicator of the high demand for live music. Along with the volume increase, transacted ticket prices globally was up approximately 15% for the first half of the year relative to 2019 as both concerts and sporting events saw similar low double-digit price increases during the period. Even with strong primary ticketing sales and increased pricing, demand for live events on our secondary ticketing marketplace remain high. And as a result, our GTV more than doubled for the quarter relative to 2019. We are continuing to see the benefits of our technology investments at Ticketmaster, including our global leadership in digital ticketing between new capabilities and the sales effectiveness of our ticketing marketplace, we consistently deliver high ticket sales for our event organizers. As a result, we continue to win business from new and existing clients. And to the first half of this year, we had a 12.8 million net new fee-bearing tickets to our marketplace, led again this year by our international markets, which accounted for 60% of this new growth. Sponsorship has also benefited from the concert flywheel this quarter, driving 74% growth in revenue relative to 2019. As we further enabled more brands to connect with an increasing number of fans on a global basis, festival sponsorship has performed particularly well during the first half of the year, more than doubling from 2019, led by nine new festivals in our Mexico and Latin American businesses that accounted for roughly half this increase, along with broad growth in sponsorship levels across most of the North American festivals. And we continue adding more clients in technology, telecom and purchase path integration, including Google, AWS and Hulu, with these categories collectively more than doubling this sponsorship since 2019. As we look forward to the second half of 2022 and into 2023, we have sold over 100 million tickets for our concerts this year, more than we sold for the entire year 2019. Fan demand remained strong and continued growth in ticket buying and on-site spending. And given the long-term nature of most of our sponsorship partnerships, our planned sponsorship for the year is now fully committed. As we prepare for 2023, everywhere globally is open for concerts. And we are actively rooting all of our markets with the largest artist pipeline we have ever seen at this point of the year. And for the 2023 tours we have put on sale so far, all signs continue pointing to strong fan demand. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details of our results.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As with last quarter, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our operations and key performance indicators, so most of our focus will be relative to Q2 of 2019. For the Company, our reported revenue of $4.4 billion for the quarter was $1.3 billion better than Q2 2019 or an increase of 40%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $4.6 billion for the quarter, so there was roughly a 4% impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In our reported AOI of $480 million for the quarter was $160 million better than 2019, up 50% and led by an improvement of over $100 million in ticketing and $80 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our Q2 AOI was $502 million. The FX impact of negative $23 million or 4% was largely driven by the devaluation of the euro and the pound. This was not only our highest Q2 AOI ever but it was also our highest quarterly AOI ever, beating our prior record quarter, which was Q3 of 2019 by 12%. Notable given that Q3 is traditionally our highest AOI quarter each year, and we converted almost 80% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $379 million. Let me give a bit more color on each division, and then I'll give you more on full year leading indicators. First, in concerts, our AOI was $123 million for the quarter, which compares to $133 million in Q2 of 2019. It was one of concert's strongest second quarters ever despite limited activity in our Asia Pacific region and operating cost increases. Additionally, while OCESA had a very strong return to activity, its AOI largely flows through sponsorship and ticketing while their concerts division absorbs most of its costs. In the quarter, we had over 33 million fans attend 12,500 events, growing nearly 25% compared to Q2 of 2019 when we had 27 million fans attend 10,000 shows. And we continue to see growth in our on-site spend with no signs of change. Here's what we're seeing so far this year by venue type across our owned or operated buildings. In our amphitheaters, ancillary per fan revenue has risen to $38.5, an increase of $9 per fan over 2019 levels or 30% growth. At our theaters and clubs in the U.S., ancillary per fan revenue has increased by over 25%, driven by higher concession sales and increased purchases of premium packages, fast lane entry and night of show upsells. In our theaters and clubs in the U.K., ancillary per fan revenue has risen by 20% compared to 2019, largely as a result of increased food and beverage consumption, pricing optimization as well as the shift to cashless payment. Finally, at our major festivals, increased spending on concessions, campaign and VIP experiences has driven ancillary per fan revenue up by over 30%. The consistent theme here is that as we continue elevating our hospitality operations and create more premium options, fans are eager to enhance their experience. At this point, we still have a lot more room to grow these higher-quality experience offerings throughout our owned or operated portfolio, which includes over 400 venues and festivals globally at this point. Next, ticketing had another very successful quarter, delivering $231 million of AOI, making it the most profitable quarter ever for ticketing, beating the record set just last year in the fourth quarter and nearly doubling the Q2 2019 AOI results of $124 million. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing with transacted ticketing GTV up 69% and 141%, respectively. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds, was 77 million tickets, our highest quarter ever, besting our former record of 65 million tickets in Q4 2021 by 18% and 25 million tickets or 48% higher than Q2 of 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV, excluding refunds, was $7.3 billion, our highest quarter ever, besting our former record of $6.6 billion of Q4 of 2021 by 11% and $3.1 billion and 76% higher than Q2 of 2019. International markets are now largely back and contributing to this growth with transacted ticketing GTV up 67% relative to Q2 2019. As Michael mentioned, approximately 75% of our growth came from concerts, which was due to both higher fan attendance at our concerts and also timing with a number of on sales expected to happen in Q3 getting moved up into Q2. Even as more of the ticket value is captured for content organizers, our secondary marketplaces continue to grow rapidly with four of our five best resale days ever in Q2 and 12 of our top 20 resale days in 2022. We continue to believe that the secondary market is a leading indicator for primary pricing opportunities over the next few years as well as a buffer against any demand fluctuations. Finally, sponsorship had its biggest quarter ever with AOI of $178 million, 80% higher than our Q2 2019 AOI of $98 million. With the U.S., the U.K. and now Mainland Europe all fully opened, we had high growth in both on-site and online sponsorship with each delivering record Q2 AOI. The growth in our large multiyear multi-asset sponsor speaks to our value of connecting live music fans with global brands. We are nearing in on 100 such major sponsors that, in total, generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue and represents nearly 75% of our growth relative to 2019. As we look to the remainder of 2022, starting with our leading indicators through late July, all relative to 2019. First, confirmed show bookings are up over 30%, driven by double-digit increases in every market and across all venue types. Our concert ticket sales through the end of July are over 100 million tickets for events this year, up 38% and higher than our full year 2019 fan count. As a result, we expect a very strong Q3 for concerts with more shows and higher attendance, including fan growth at our owned or operated venues where we are continuing to see strong APF increases. Also, similar to last year, we are extending the amphitheater later in the year, adding over 1 million fans in Q4 this year relative to 2019. Michael also gave the numbers around much of our Q2 fan growth being driven by international markets, which is a great indicator of the broadly global health of our fan base. But I don't want anyone to over extrapolate this to the U.S. market as we expect North America will drive much of our fan growth in Q3. Second, ticketing has sold 183 million primary fee-bearing tickets for events this year, up 30%. Of these, 122 million tickets are for concert events, which is 42% higher than 2019. Related to this, we have $3.2 billion in event-related deferred revenue, double our level in Q2 of 2019. These are largely tickets that have been sold by Ticketmaster for Live Nation concerts but the revenue and AOI hasn't flowed through yet, and we'll do so over the course of the next year as the events occur. We remain on course for a strong Q3 in ticketing as our deferred revenue is recognized but also impacted by the shift of some of the on sales that moved into Q2. On the sponsorship side, we expect to see continued growth driven by our strong Q3 festival lineup with some of this activity also involving on-site activation support. On the cost side, increases continue to impact us primarily in the venues we operate, amphitheaters, theaters and clubs and festivals. But in all cases, we are delivering increased profitability per fan due to increased ticket and ancillary revenue. A few other points on 2022, given our presence in the U.K. and mainland Europe, we've experienced FX headwinds. And through the end of June, our AOI has been adversely impacted by $23 million. This was almost entirely in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the euro and the British pound. Based on current rates, we expect our AOI to continue having a 3% to 4% hit in the second half. We provided detailed guidance on line items that impact our EPS calculation last quarter, and there's just one update that I wanted to make here, which is, as noted, we expect the headwinds with FX rates to continue through the remainder of the year, which at current forward rates result in approximately $15 million quarterly below-the-line expense due to currency exchange losses on the revaluation of our foreign balance sheet balances to U.S. dollars. In anticipation of the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we continue to expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with 2/3 allocated to revenue-generating projects. We expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be back in the mid-50s for the full year. And we ended Q2 with $2.5 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate and our average cost of debt of roughly 4.3%, positioning us well in this interest rate environment. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: Michael, I wanted to get your thoughts on pricing in VIP tickets. We've seen artists and VIP inventory even amid some fan pushback and negative press, which looks to me to be a break from prior years. So do you think the industry has collectively gotten to a place where artists are now kind of comfortable reclaiming the secondary market economics? And then, how much more room is there to kind of drive this process?
Michael Rapino: Yes. Thank you. I think we've been saying for a few years that over time, we believe that, that secondary 10 billion, 12 billion, depending on what number you see globally has to start getting captured by the artist at some level. It's just too transparent. The more they see all of the online pricing while they work so hard to put that show on. So I do think that right artists looking at us saying, I'd like to count some of it in the front end. I don't want to be sold out at 10 01 at $200 to have someone else make $2,000. Fans not getting a deal anyway, they're spending $2,000 from somebody else. So I do think they're looking and saying, the front of the house, can we capture some demand? Now, the advantage is the, artist has one objective as we do as the venue to fill every seat. So you're never looking for the gross, you're looking to make sure that every seat is filled for the best experience. We want that. We just want that. So I do think the new dynamic pricing, the better we have become, these tools to the artists, they're looking at the holistic picture. Maybe I can charge a bit more in the front row. I got to charge less in the back row because net I'm going to sell through the back end of the house that maybe is always spot in our business. Now if you can still get the same gross, but you can lower the ticket price in the back part of the house, that's a win for everyone. So, we're right now -- Joe has the exact math. We looked at it yesterday. It's still a small percentage of the total growth is price platinum and/or dynamic, 1%, 2% kind of numbers, and really nonexistent outside of America. We just -- so yes, there's a long runway where the artists will look at the small, again, even as much always, as you heard about the Springsteen sale, than 1% of the tickets were priced a little higher to capture the second business versus 99% of the house. So to the artist, I think they'll look at us -- and then the premium, the dynamic, how do I better price my product, fill the house, lower the price on the back, capture more of the front, and we think that's got many years of runway for us to expand on a global basis.
David Karnovsky: Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to ask on concerts AOI in the quarter. I think it was roughly flat versus '19, and that's with the increase in fans and the per caps. Just wondering if you could speak to the impact of things like cost inflation, mix. I know you said APAC wasn't fully open and then maybe timing as well. I think Q2 '19, if I remember correctly, had some pull forward from Q3 in that year?
Joe Berchtold: This is Joe. Yes, I'll take that. I think we laid out a handful of factors that we think were some combination of timing and one-offs that impacted this quarter. Asia Pacific is not fully open yet we've got the organization up and running to prepare for being open. Just the structure of OCESA's P&L is they really drive their economics through ticketing and sponsorship whereas most of their cost structure is in the concert side. We talked about some operating cost increases for our operated venues, still driving per fan profitability increases, but you have some costs there. And then it's just -- I wouldn't over read one quarter. I gave you in mind, for instance, that a lot of this was in international markets that we had our growth, less growth in this quarter in North America. But then we have a lot of growth in Q3 in North America. As I look at the numbers overall, North America, if you look at our 100 million tickets, North America has 30% growth. So as that flows through and Q3, you'd expect to see some of that flip it around. I just don't want to read too much into it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Brandon Ross: Just wanted to drill down a little more on David's question about platinum ticketing. And I was wondering, Michael, if you could just -- because I think a lot of investors and fans are not really educated on how platinum ticketing works, can you talk about who sets the prices and kind of the cadence of ticket releases? And how you think about the -- when tickets are going to be released kind of this move from fast ticketing where everything was available at the on sale to maybe trickling out tickets more over time? And then how you think about the balance of dollars and maximizing profits for the artists with this idea of fandom and fairness and what your role in that is?
Michael Rapino: All right. That's a lot. I'll try to take some pieces. We work for the artist. We're a B2B business. The artist is that decides when they tour, how they tour. Our job is to provide all the tools, platform and services to help them succeed in that tour from -- a year. Now our decision is -- they're genius brand managers. They have to balance the needs of their fans, supply demand and pricing. And some brands, like the Rolling Stones, have been very good at always saying expensive experience and we're that proud and enable to deliver that brand position. But I think artists are always trying to find a fine line on how do I make the show accessible? How do I make sure all my fans can show? How do I price it fairly versus how much money can I make? So I think they see that. I think today, while the technology is advancing and they're starting to look at more technology and more pricing data, I think they can now -- good shows and realize that some ways they keep price, 1, 2% of the house higher and achieved some of those economics versus the scalper while still pricing 98% of the house at a very stable brand position. So we can achieve both. This is an industry that for 30 years, we would do a tour. They would set three ticket prices 140, 79 and 39, and that will be the three prices in every city for every night for the market, as you know. That's way it's going to operate forward, a different price on a Friday in New York than Indianapolis on a Tuesday. So dynamic smart pricing, now that we're able to provide that sophistication, the bands are much more sophisticated. And they're now able to have tools to figure out how do I price it better and -- some better economics, get some of the leakage of secondary, but still maintain an overall ticket price, leaving dollars on the table, but still finding that balance between the consumer demand, the brand and the slippage of the economics to secondary they've been losing.
Joe Berchtold: Sorry, Brandon. Sorry, Brandon. Sorry, just one comment I have to respond to. Your commentary about trickling out tickets, that's not a practice. That's not something that is the norm or something that we do. I think that the speed of ticketing has to do with just what's the pace at which some of them sell out with the theory being for some artists, if they price a lot of tickets at market price, they may not all sell out in the first hour, so it has nothing to do. Ticketmaster takes all the tickets. It gets -- puts them directly on sale. It does nothing to try to limit supply or anything in that manner. So I just want to make sure we're crystal clear on that.
Brandon Ross: Yes. No, I wasn't agreed on that decision anyway.
Michael Rapino: Yes. But I think we're just addressing because the marketplace. The consumer obviously gets a little -- time when at 10:00, there's lots of secondary tickets, right? So historically, the Bruce fan would have been sold out at 10 and had to go to a secondary to buy that good seat. So today, we're sorting through that process where we can provide information to the fans. But our job at Ticketmasters is put every sale on ticket -- provide none into the secondary market and provide all the data to the artists that they can invest up and down and as the market adjusts.
Brandon Ross: Got it. And then talking about dynamic pricing, if there was to be some kind of downturn in the next year or so that actually affected the live entertainment business, do you see kind of the same tools as flexibility to respond to market conditions in bringing ticket prices down as much as you bring them up in this demand environment?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. Controls can be used -- go ahead, Michael.
Michael Rapino: No. I said it before in our last call, I mean, we looked at the last recession, there was a single-digit back in some ticket sales, but we were -- years ago, not even in the same -- indication on pricing nor did we have the tool. So yes, we look at data pricing now, dynamic pricing, look at all market data algorithms to figure out what is the price point that we'll sell through. And we do believe that because of the upside right now in the premium secondary side of our business, that if we had to pull back ticket sales and dropped prices by 5% or 10% to match supply/demand of inflation, we have so much flexibility in pricing to get that done and still sell through the house and lower price if that was needed for a band to sell-through tickets.
Joe Berchtold: And artist...
Michael Rapino: The number one goal is to set -- their number one goal -- sell every ticket. So there are always going to be in a variable -- of how do I price it -- what do I got to reduce our end of house, front end of the house? What do we need to do a sell-through on a Tuesday night in Indianapolis? Let's adjust pricing.
Joe Berchtold: The other part of the buffer, Brandon, is just the secondary market itself, and how big it is, its continued growth, right? I gave you the numbers. The secondary market for us grew 140% this quarter. So that tells you that even if some pricing is going up on the primary side, the secondary is growing up -- going up even faster, both in terms of volume and price points. So our first line of defense is keeping our eye on secondary and using that buffer if there is any variations in demand.
Brandon Ross: Got it. And then finally, if you could just double-click a little on 30 additional venues that you're talking about adding. Are those -- what venue types are those? And how impactful do you see that to be in the future?
Michael Rapino: Well, I think in our investor conference, we wanted to kind of highlight -- I think it's always been an under -- strong business, but we've put more focus on it from an operational design development. We've got over those 300 venues. We manage -- we've been adding 20 to 30 a year over the last few years. As you know, Boston been an incredible success in which will provide more return. And those 30 that we have in the pipe now, another 75 behind of those on a global basis are everything from clubs to arenas depending on where the hole in the market may exist. And we see great platform there. And as we've said before, when we show in an operated venue that we have the sponsorship and the ticketing and the food and beverage and all the revenue streams, that's our highest return for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: On fan growth for the year, maybe for Joe, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, not extrapolating international growth or contribution on the U.S. market this year. Can you maybe unpack that for us a little bit and maybe touch on what portion of fan growth you expect will come from acquisitions versus organic growth in markets like the U.S. or the U.K. this year?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. I'll use as the basis, the 100-or-so million tickets that we sold through July because I think that just -- that gives the numbers and the facts. And as I indicated, within that, the U.S. is up about just over 30% and international was up 40-odd percent. So you have strong organic growth across both North America and international. Our primary acquisition, of course, would be OCESA, and that would be somewhat less than half of the international growth. So the international growth, even absent acquisitions would be in the mid- to high 20s. So again, this is not an acquisition dependent growth? This is organic plus acquisition.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. That's helpful. And then maybe one for Michael. I was curious if you're seeing any unique trends develop in terms of fan behavior this year. For example, we've seen more first-time concert goers come out this year or fan set to attend events with greater frequency. I'd be curious if you've seen any of those data points or any of these trends that you're seeing, open portions of the market up going forward that maybe you haven't seen come into the industry before?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I'll take this. Michael is having some audio problems here. I think that what we're seeing is a very broad-based, high priority of going to concerts against fans that are interested in going to concerts. So it's a bit of all of the above. We're certainly we have people who haven't gone to concerts in a long time going. We have concerts that will go to one, now going to two. We have concerts -- we have people that are going to many. So it's not -- I don't think you could pull it apart as one factor. I think you're seeing a broad-based high demand return to shows and when they're there, a broad-based pattern on site.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Glagola: Concert ticket prices, I want to go back to that being up 10% year-over-year versus 2019. Joe, can you just break out how much of this increase is being driven by market pricing versus price ticketing increases at the on sale?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. As Michael said, the dynamically priced tickets represent a very small percentage of the overall tickets. So it's not going to be felt by most people. I would -- I don't have the exact numbers. I would guess that it's less than half of the impact is from that. And then there is a general increase. I can probably use the fact that the entry price of $33 is up about 5% from 2019 as a proxy for what's going on with the overall ticket pricing. And then maybe the remainder is driven by the more front-of-house activity. And again, those numbers are -- because there's a lot of attention on how much the overall ticket prices are up. If you look at the U.S. market, the U.S. is up between 12% and 13% in terms of inflation over the past three years as a comparative.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Katz: I wanted to just get a little more color, if we can, about international markets and international landscapes. And if we obviously are seeing a lot of strong demand, is it relatively even if we look at international markets relative to the U.S.? Or are there any that are stronger or weaker, et cetera?
Michael Rapino: Yes, we're seeing no difference right now in demand across the globe. You can look at, I guess, Springsteen just went on sale last week, global stadiums across Europe everywhere, sold out just as fast in Europe as it did here similar to Post Malone, Kendrick. So the tours that are selling here are selling it as fast in our international markets, Latin America, Mexico, continue to see completely record demand in all those markets. We're also still seeing walk up strong at our festivals and on-site as of last weekend, right? So that's kind of current data. There's still spending money. They're still buying tickets at high demand. So we have pullback yet in Europe or any international market.
David Katz: Great. And am I permitted to follow up? Or would you prefer I went back in the queue?
Michael Rapino: Go ahead.
David Katz: Okay. With respect to digital initiatives around ticketing, if you could just talk about kind of -- it's obviously exciting and productive, sort of what inning you'd say we're in and any observation surprising or otherwise so far?
Joe Berchtold: Yes, we're still in early innings. This is the first summer that we're really deploying at scale, the data and the technology so that we can reach out to fans once they bought the ticket, do upsells, first people who are going to shows that our venues, connecting them with sponsors, seeing some very good increases in our upsell levels as we talk about some of our average per fan spending, and the increase on premiums at our amphitheaters, for instance, more premium parking, more premium entry, VIP clubs. It's certainly enhanced by our ability to reach -- have a platform that can reach out and sell to those fans effectively, and you're not depending on them just figuring it out night of. So we're very happy with the early progress we're making.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Sundby: With Asia Pac still limited this quarter, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about, one, how quickly that ramps from here? And then maybe two, a little more on the long-term opportunity there volume, the recent acquisitions in Thailand and the Philippines, I think plans in place to bring Lollapalooza to India next year. Any color on how that kind of comes together and how large not really, that would be great?
Michael Rapino: Yes, most of that, I think it was Asia reference. We're currently in 40 countries, hundred offices in 40 countries, varying degree of market share from the U.S. to Cape Town or South Africa. So we've got a global platform, and that was always our first priority. So we can say that any artists, we can put you on the road in any market sponsorship make it happen. Then when we get kind of our flag in the ground, we start to maybe launch or build festivals, operate venues, build up our ticketing, sponsorship and the model and the flywheel start to work. You can kind of look at our business across the globe, different markets we're in varying degrees of that growth. Latin America, we were very, very undeveloped in all markets. Obviously, now with OCESA, we've got that flywheel in Mexico. We bought festivals in Latin America with Rockland Rio and then bringing Lala, a lot of couple of promoters. We're going to get some venues going. So the flywheel is starting to work in Brazil and Colombia and Argentina, but we're kind of go from zero market share to big opportunity there. So that will continue to be a big focus for us. Western Europe, there's still some markets we're undeveloped in whether be Portugal or Spain, certain markets, we don't have the full flywheel and you'll see us continually add a festival or a promoter or a venue to those markets. Asia, we have a good platform. We have people on the ground. We've got a really strong business in Australia and New Zealand. But as we moved up to Pacific Rim, we've been slowly building the flywheel in all those markets. Japan is probably the one market that's the best and biggest in that market. We've got to do more work on that. But we look at Asia as really undeveloped territory, low market share, huge opportunity over the next while. We like everyone else in the world, we look at Asia, we look at Latin America, and we're looking to the Middle East and Eastern Europe is areas where we have no real market share. But that consumer now on TikTok knows that Drake dropped the video last night, whether they live in Singapore, India, Cape Town. So we've got a global product, and we've got lots of opportunity to keep growing.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Harrigan: Recognizing that you can't alter the weather or nature and there's an amphitheater season and all that, you're really inducing a lot of serial correlation, I think, activity among concertgoers. I mean people are going back and even when people, I think, go to movie theaters, you get people -- there's a hit movie and there tends to be a lot of repeat behavior. Do you think that all the initiatives you're undertaking are going to alter the seasonality in your business somewhat and maybe make Q4 a lot more active even on a relative basis than has historically been because it feels like there are a lot of things pushing in that direction if you take out concerns with weather and all that?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. This is Joe. I gave you some numbers that in our amphitheaters. We do expect to have about 1 million more fans attending shows than we had in 2019. So, we're certainly seeing an extension of the amphitheater outdoor season, particularly through the more southern states. Theaters and clubs have always been very active in Q4. Arenas tend not to be quite as big just because it gets -- the routing gets interrupted by more of the holidays. So, we'll see a bit. I don't think it will dramatically change.
Michael Rapino: But it will be -- why we look at our business as global. In the U.S., the arenas, NBA, NHL and NFL clog up the venues in the fall into the winter. But that's why we take a lot of these artists now and say let's go to Asia Pacific and Pacific Rim and Latin America. Let's get off-site middle of America and go to those markets as those open up. So there is a big 12-month-a-year business on a global basis. This industry is focused too much on the U.S. Western Europe summer business. But you are right, as the business expands in a lot of those markets, you have a 12-month strong market where you can put a sell-out show in other markets while you're waiting for a summer business here.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Golding: Michael and Joe, congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask, given the strong demand that we're seeing across the board here and what I presume is some overflow in terms of demand that is unable to get a seat, where does streaming fit into the medium-term strategy now? I know it was more of a focal point, of course, during the pandemic, but just seeing opportunity for sponsorship or advertising through that. How much incremental focus will there be on that going forward or sort of walking back from that a bit? Just help us think about monetization there or investment if it's still a strategic point for you.
Michael Rapino: I think we were clearing things a bit. We were not moved by the thesis that might have been for a moment that live is duplicated and digital. What we've always said that this magic two hours, you have to physically experience this. But we love the . It's a very unique space. It can't be duplicatable. But we've always said that we have all these shows and the most accessible, especially in dedicated fan, but you can expand that show and there's an audience that wants to watch their favorite artist over the weekend. We had an incredible broadcast on Hulu for today's high-quality filming and broadcasting live  festival, fabulous. So we've always thought the screen is an extension. It's great for our sponsorship business, where we have 900 sponsors looking always to be part of the show, both on and off. So, we love beats, we love the opportunity. We're doing thousands of shows. And we think it's an ancillary business that helps our overall sponsorship business as well as our committed festival business. Our business is so big now. I wouldn't say it's a material piece on its own. We never thought it would be, but it's another service we provide to both the artist, festival and sponsor, and it's something you have to be in.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'd like to turn the call back to Michael Rapino for closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everybody. Have a great summer, and we'll talk in the fall.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.

Michael Rapino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Momentum has picked up for all of our businesses over the course of the first quarter. And as a result, we have delivered financial performance that greatly surpassed our previous expectations with AOI of $209 million. Artists are back on the road and fan demand has never been stronger. The reflection of live events remain a clear priority for consumers as our social lives restart. Ticket buying serves as a leading indicator to our overall business. Ticketmaster's strong first quarter performance drove the company's overall profitability and shows how well our concert and sponsorship businesses are positioned to deliver record results this year. Despite some markets taking longer to reopen, the quarter was our second highest ever we transacted GTV, excluding refunds, trailing only Q4 2021 with March being our highest transacted GTV month ever. In primary ticketing, we're now benefiting from the 17 million new fee-bearing tickets we gained in 2021, which helped us drive transacted GTV for the quarter up 33% relative to 2019. This quarter was also added 7 million new additional tickets through new contracts with Venues as well as content creators, setting us up for ongoing growth this year and into 2023. Our secondary ticketing GTV growth was even higher up 106% relative to 2019 driven largely by average retail ticket price up 20% relative to 2019 and a tremendous fan demand pushed up the market pricing, Ticketmaster, gaining additional market share by effectively leveraging its team and league partnerships across NFL, NBA and other sporting events. And the market continued growing at double-digit pace, demonstrating high demand for live events, as well as how much runway there is for continued pricing, efficiently. Fan demand and signing of new contracts accelerated even faster than expected this quarter, reinforcing the Ticketmaster as the enterprise platform for choice of teams, artists and content creators, and continuing to be the most effective fan marketplace. Our sponsorship activity fully returned in Q1, delivering financial results that well exceeded 2019. We're seeing growth across a number of dimensions, expansion of existing relationships, new categories expanding our breadth to partners and new ad units being created both onsite and online. The number of strategic sponsors that generated over $1 million of revenue per year has risen by almost 30% since 2019. With our committed span up 70% and accounting for 80% of our total sponsorship revenue, about 60% of this growth has come from three categories of particular priority over the past two years; technology, telecom and purchase path integration, which has collectively more than doubled their sponsorships since 2019. Much of our focus with brand partners is how we collectively elevate the fan experience. We've had great success with this in recent years. And so far this year through our partnership with Verizon, we started powering our Venues with cutting edge 5G connectivity and are launching initiative with Snap to give artists augmented reality capabilities at shows and festivals. At this point, sponsorship sales are up double digits relative to 2019, and we have a solid 90% of our planned sponsored for the year, positioning us for continued strong financial performance. The concert division, all leading indicators, point to double-digit growth and fan attendance at our concerts relative to 2019. Approximately 11 million fans attended our shows in the first quarter compared to 15 million fans in 2019. This was expected as we planned for limited concert activity in the early months of the year to allow for markets to open. But more importantly, we continue to build our flywheel with over 70 million tickets now sold for shows in 2022, up to 36 million, compared to 2019 and committed show count is up 44% through the end of April, relative to 19%, setting us up for continued ticket sales over the year. We continue to see the fans are showing up for the concerts they have tickets for, with attendance rates in the US across all venue types at 2019 levels with no shows generally in the low mid-single digits. The industry continues to embrace market-based pricing, particularly on the best tickets, shifting $500 million to artists for shows this year, resulting from a double-digit increase in ticket pricing and reducing the price arbitrage in the secondary market. At the same time in the US, the average entry level price to get in and enjoy the show remains under $35, approachable for almost all fans. Early reads on consumer spending on our shows across the US and UK also indicate fans continue their spending when they get to the show. We had two million fans at 10 shows at our theaters and clubs in the first quarter with average per fan revenue up 30% relative to 2019. And we've had four festivals over the past few months to lean over 300,000 fans with average per fan revenue up 30% also. Looking ahead to the summer and the rest of the year, we remain optimistic that we are just getting going as all leading indicators reinforce record activity levels and financial results. Ticket sales were at record levels in Q1 with momentum building over February and March. We sold almost 20 million more tickets to our concerts this year in this point in time in 2019, with large number of tours still to go on sale and concert fans are showing no sign of slowing down. They're paying for the best tickets, attending the shows and spending more on site as they create lifetime memories. We're continuing to build Venue Nation, our platform of operated Venues with a pipeline of 20 Venues, including the recently open Moody Center in Austin, in addition to adding 38 more festivals this year. Sponsors are looking to spend more this year on live entertainment than ever and Live Nation's scale and global platform is making us the partner of choice. While the US and UK have driven much of our activity over the past year, the rest of the world is now rapidly opening up. Assess this financial performance for the quarter, exceeded its 2019 results and both Latin America and Western Europe are expected to have record attendance for our concerts this year. I continue to expect this just to be the start of our run, the global addressable markets for concerts, ticketing and sponsorship, all provide a long runway for continued growth. We have over 60 tours already under discussion for 2023, our earliest indicators of next year in great positioning for ongoing growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Given the unique situation in 2020 and 2021, Q1 of 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our operations and key performance indicators. So while I will provide some commentary around our results relative to Q1 of 2021, most of our focus will be relative to 2019. Overall, our AOI of $209 million for the quarter was $361 million better than 2021, led by an improvement of $269 million in ticketing, $66 million in sponsorship and $26 million in concerts. This was our highest Q1 AOI ever exceeding Q1 of 2019 by $94 million, which had been our previous record first quarter. Let me give a bit more color on each division. Then I will give you more on 2022 leading indicators. First ticketing was again the star of the quarter delivering $206 million in AOI, making it the second best quarter ever for ticketing and more than doubling the Q1 2019 AOI results of a $100 million. The first quarter of 2021 was heavily impacted by the pandemic resulting in an AOI loss of $63 million. Ticketing was successful across the board. Let me give a few key statistics for the quarter. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing with transacted GTV, excluding refunds up 33% and 106% respectively. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds were 63 million tickets, our fourth highest quarter ever, and 7 million tickets higher than Q1 of 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV excluding refunds was $6.3 billion, our second highest quarter ever after Q4 of 2021 and 39% higher than Q1 2019. This was driven by concerts and sporting events whose GTV were up 49% and 73% respectively relative to Q1 2019. A continued shift toward more market-based pricing help grow our GTV levels with average primary ticket prices up double-digits for the first quarter, relative to Q1 2019. And in resale, our average price increased 18% while our overall resale GTV doubled compared to the first quarter of 2019, indicating that demand for the top seats across all live events continues to outpace efforts by sports teams, artists, and others, to capture more of the full value from their events. As the first effectively normal Q1 since 2019, we are seeing that digital tickets have now become the norm across live events with the NFL and NBA leading the way with 96% of fans using digital tickets to enter games up from 53% in Q1 of 2019. More broadly, 72% of our tickets globally were digital in Q1 of 2022, relative to 33% in Q1 2019. With this level of digital adoption, we can now accelerate our efforts to foster our direct fan relationships this year and into 2023. Next, sponsorship continued to ramp up with the reopening of Venues and expanded online opportunities. As a result, 2022 Q1 sponsorship and advertising AOI of $70 million grew by 75% relative to 2019 Q1 AOI of $40 million. This strength comes across both onsite and online each delivering record Q1 AOI. The growth versus 2019 was driven by expansion of our online business, new festivals that launched in the quarter and the addition of O's brand partners. Finally, in concerts, our AOI was a loss of $49 million, which compares to a loss of $74 million in Q1 of 2021 and positive AOI of $5 million in Q1 of 2019. As we indicated on the last call, we planned for fewer arena tours in Q1 this year, which typically drives our first quarter performance, resulting in concert seasonality that will be even more Q2 and Q3 driven this year than has historically been the case. In the quarter, we had nearly 11 million fans attend 6,600 events continuing to be led by the US and the UK, which accounted for almost 80% of these fans. In comparison, Q1 of 2019 had 15 million fans and 8,200 shows when all of our markets and all venue types were fully open. For ticket sales through late April for shows playing off this year, our average ticket price was up double digits relative to the first quarter of 2019, again mainly driven by demand for the best seats. At the same time, our average entry price remains less than $35 overall and less than $30 for amphitheatre and club shows. Michael mentioned that no-how rates were back to pre-COVID levels. So I wanted to give a few more specifics to hopefully set the record straight. Looking at the full year through mid-April for the US, our no-show rates were the same or better than the same period for 2019. For arenas, they were 1% better for amphitheatres, they were 4% better, for theaters and clubs, they were on par and all up, we are 2% better. We haven't had enough volume on other outdoor events to have meaningful metrics yet, but generally those Venues had strong re-openings last summer and so we don't expect any issues there and used there. In general, the US was ahead of the rest of the world, but the UK is now fully backed to pre-pandemic, no-show rates as well and we have not seen any evidence in any markets of any long-term impact on our shows. Michael gave you the top line on our first quarter average revenue per fan growth up 30% for both theaters and clubs and festivals. For theaters and clubs, key drivers include onsite concessions and upsells and for festivals, the growth was heavily driven by onsite concessions and increased VIP purchases. All indicators have continued strong fans spending as they look to make the most of going to the show. Finally, COVID continues to have less and less impact on our concert schedule and by March in the US, we cancelled only around 1% of our planned concerts. As we look to the remainder of 2022, looking at our leading indicators through the end of April 1, confirmed show bookings are up over 40% overall and up double-digits for each amphitheatres, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Second, ticketing has sold 130 million fee bearing tickets for events this year up 26% from this point in 2019, of these, 88 million tickets over concert events, which is 40% higher than 2019. Related to this, we have $3.5 billion in event-related deferred revenue, almost twice the level of Q1 2019. These are largely tickets that have been sold by Ticketmaster for Live Nation concerts, but the revenue in AOI hasn't flowed through yet and will do so over the course of this year, as events happen. On the sponsorship side, commitments are up double-digits from this point in 2019 and overall we have more than 90% of our plan sponsorship net revenue for 2022 set. On the cost side, we're obviously tracking closely cost increases associated both with labor and in general, with supply chain challenges and inflation. These costs tend to hit us primarily in the Venues we operate; amphitheatres, theaters and clubs and festivals. For amphitheatres and theaters and clubs, labor is the largest factor given we have our Venues in place. Across this entire fan base, we expect our variable cost per fan, excluding talent to increase by $2 to $2.50 relative to 2019. This remains well below our average revenue per fan growth and so we still expect to grow average per fan profitability across our operated Venues this year. Festivals have a broader range of costs given the wider set of equipment and services involved in building these events. Current projections are that variable costs per fan excluding talent will be up 7% this year, which is well below our expected increase in ticket revenue per fan. Helping offset all these costs is the $200 million cost reduction exercise that we executed last year, which remains well in place. A few other points on 2022, we now expect OCESA will deliver full year results in line with 2019 levels as Mexico is fully active with most of their AOI flowing through our sponsorship and ticketing divisions. In light of the OCESA acquisition, we wanna provide more guidance on a few mine items below AOI, which impact our earnings per share calculation. First on depreciation and amortization, we expect the combination of these accounts to be roughly in line with 2019. The addition of OCESA is offset by the impacts of our reduced investment in CapEx and M&A over the past two years. With the acquisition of OCESA and anticipated strong performance of our festivals, many of which are joined ventures, we expect non-controlling interest expense will be roughly double 2019 levels. We are projecting increasing to be about $150 million this year. Again, the increase compared to 2019 is largely attributable to the OCESA acquisition. As a result of the additional financing opportunities over the past two years, our interest expense is now roughly $70 million per quarter. Finally, in comparison to 2019, we expect income tax expense will grow in line with our AOI growth. In anticipation and the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we continue to expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million with two thirds of this spent on revenue generating projects. We generated $89 million of adjusted free cash flow this quarter and expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be back in the fifties for the full year. We ended Q1 with $1.9 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to invest in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate and our average cost of debt is roughly 4.3% positioning as well in this interest rate environment. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator:  Your first question comes from line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: All right. Thank you. Michael, you've given a lot of great leading indicators for '22. So I apologize to jump ahead, but you did mention in the release 60 tours and discussion for '23 and was hoping you could put some context around that. How elevated would that number be, kind of relative to what you might normally be looking at this early on and is there a way to kind of think through how much of that is sort of backlog continue to work through from the pandemic versus sort of just you organically increasing your footprint?
Michael Rapino: Yeah, thank you. The '23 is really no backlog. '22 is the year where we would've flushed out any reschedule tours from 2019 '21, wherever. So 2023 is kind of if you want to call almost back to business and yes, it's a very vibrant pipe. I think we said at the Investor Date, if you want to kind of scale back and look at the next five years, you can kind of look at what we did going into '19, where we looked at the industry growing at almost 10% a year on a compounded basis. We think the industry is going to be doing that again. It's back to full growth, high quality growth sector industry and we think we tend to outperform the industry. So we look at '23 will be a, if you want to call it a record year coming off of '22, and we think we're in for multiple record years of growth.
David Karnovsky: Okay. Grant, and then just on Ticketmaster, I was wondering if you could just walk through some of the drivers of the strong secondary growth you're seeing in particular, you mentioned share gains, whereas in the past, I think we tended to think of market shares for you and your competitors as generally stable. Maybe you could just speak to some of the initiatives, you taking it to league or team level to kind of drive that higher. And then just as a follow on, is there any update you can provide on the NFL relationship just given that's now extended to 2026. Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Hey David, this is Joe I'll take it. And I think the questions are related. Start with the NFL. We entered the partnership with the NFL four years ago, I guess, and that relationship was really technology driven and it was a mutual strategy of figuring out how do we shift the industry to digital ticketing? How do we understand identity-enabled relationships with the fans, for the leagues, for the teams as well as for Ticketmaster and that's proven to be very successful and obviously coming out of COVID not surprisingly, the NFL said, what's the next technology agenda. We worked with them on deploying NFTs and they said, this is all great, better to talk now about linking back up for the next five years. So we know we can work together and figure out what's the next technology unlocked. How do we continue to use technology is really it's the core of the relationship or the starting point of the relationship with the fans. So that's what led to the renewal. We're excited about it. We think the NFL's been a great partner and we'll continue to be. So naturally as you do that, we continue at Ticketmaster to get smarter and smarter about the fan as well. That lets us continue to use our alignment and our mutual interest with the teams and the league in terms of driving Ticketmaster share in the secondary. So we're taking all the data we have, all the information we're working with them on all of their assets to help acquire customers, to use all the season ticket holder inventory, to continue to drive our share and provide a great marketplace, a great experience for fans to be buying those tickets. So combination of all of those has led to increasing share which is as Michael talked about part of how we've doubled secondary in the first quarter relative to 2019.
David Karnovsky: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk - Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to start, I think there's been a fair amount of concern on the macro front. You touched on a little bit at the end of your prepared remarks, but I was curious if you're seeing any signs of consumers changing their spending habits, whether that's on the initial ticket purchase or once they get to the venue against what's turning out to be a pretty difficult inflationary environment. Any data points from the last few weeks I think would be helpful there.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, I think this is Joe. I think all of the data points that we're seeing continue to be very strong. Look at our concert ticket sales as we look in March and April, each of those months the ticket sales were up 20% plus relative to 2019. So through March and April, I think we've seen some of these pressures, the gas and so on for a few months now. So not just a few weeks, so we've seen no impact at all on the concert ticket sales. We talked about the pricing, seeing no impact on the take rate of those tickets and the onsite spending the EFs again seeing those up substantially relative to 2019. So no impact there. So from all the different angles that we've looked at it, we have not seen any pullback in consumer behavior. I think that this continues to be part of people want to get out, have a social life, to spend on experiences taking money away from spending on goods. And a lot of what we do is we spoke to the $35 overall average entry price for a ticket or $30 for clubs and amphitheatre. It continues to be a very affordable night out for those that need to be most conscious of that.
Stephen Laszczyk: Thanks. That's helpful. And then I think in the pressure release, you mentioned some opportunity to create new ad units on the sponsorship side, both on site and online. I was wondering if you talk a little bit more about this opportunity and the new inventory, how much of it you expect to create over time and whether that might help bring in new ad categories?
Joe Berchtold: Well, it is creating new ad categories, right? We talked about that in the technology space, in the FinTech space, throughout the whole purchase path integration, all of that is creating new categories and that's, what's driving even this year a lot of the growth in the sponsorship business. Michael talked very explicitly about what you're seeing on site. Two great examples of how technology's being used to enhance the live experience with Verizon, putting in the infrastructure with the 5G connectivity and with snap as a great product development, product design organization, coming up with some ways to use their products and augmented reality to enhance the onsite experience. So really on the onsite piece, this is all about how do you make a better and better fan experience? And we've got great brands, partners that we work with that are looking to do more and more to make that possible and then as we continue to work on the Ticketmaster marketplace, tie that in with the increased data that we have from the digital ticketing that we were just talking about, how do we create more tailored ad units and make more opportunities for more sponsors to connect with those fans as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Brandon Ross: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to build the macro concerns that the last analyst kind of laid out and insofar as inflation and gas prices are concerned, I think the results speak for themselves, but investor pushback has now moved to the possibility of recession and how that would affect you given how deeply consumer discretionary you are. How do you think about your positioning at this point, if a recession scenario played out? Your company and the industry looks very different than it did in 2010 when we lost less of that kind of macro pressure, can you kind of compare and contrast and I know you were booking those acts for next year, kind of far in advance, how much flexibility is there in those contracts?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. Brandon, This is Joe. Oh, go ahead.
Michael Rapino: I was -- I'll start and then Joe and jump in. What we always think is one of the great advantages of our business is the pricing is variable, right? So there is no set cost of good. The cost of good is determined by the artist if they go on the road and they're variable. So that makes our product something that can move around on pricing, whether it's taking advantage of the front row pricing, that's under-priced or moving the total ticket price down in the back end of the house or reducing the overall price of the ticket to meet the market and the demand. So historically this is an industry that's been fairly recession proof. It's still, as we've seen, this is still one of the top three entertainment choices for consumer, but the most affordable. So you may not in a recession take that trip. You may not have a large out a purchase of a dishwasher, but you will still go down to amphitheatre or the club or the theater and have a great adventure and a night out for the value. So we have always seen historically over time, the consumer still looks at the concert as a high value item that even during the recession, if there was a pullback, this is something they still can afford to do. And it's actually a great alternative to a higher priced, maybe travel package. So one, we think it is a -- still a much a very affordable option for consumers and pricing will continue to be something that we can adjust. If we see any pullback, artists will always have one motive the same as ours, fill the house, get everyone in the house. So right up until the hour of the show, we always look at variable and dynamic pricing options to say, how do we get the house full. Joe?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. And just to build on that first is we now have a level of information that is very -- we didn't have even 10 years ago and almost no industry has called the secondary market. So to Michael's point on pricing flexibility, we have the benefit of knowing real time, what is market pricing and so on one level, you can think that billion dollars plus of price arbitrage that exists on our tickets, that's the first wall of defense in any recessionary environment that pricing comes out first before our pricing's even impacted. And we have a great read on what is the supply that dynamic to be adjusting as we go along. And then along with that, again, you have, again, the macros of the shift of spend from experience -- from goods to experiences, which is continuing. You have the wealth built up and the biggest gains in terms of the income with a lower quartile. So you've got good revenue there. Still, you've got affordable entry prices that we've talked about on the tickets. So we continue to think that as long as we stay focused on what is the value perceived by the fan, stay aligned with that. We'll be able to bring the acts out and sell the tickets.
Brandon Ross: Great. And then for the first time that I can remember, at least you called out the per caps at theatres, clubs and festivals, it's not something you usually talk about. That's usually the amphitheatre opportunity. Can you kind of help us understand where you stand relative to the amphitheatre opportunity on per caps at those other owned and operated venue types and how much upside there could be for investors in that area?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, we called out the theatres and clubs in the festivals this quarter because we knew that all you guys were going to want some data on what's going on with the fans on site. It being the first quarter, we don't really have amphitheatre data yet. So we were trying to use what data we could have on our other buildings, the theatres and clubs and festivals and then also to tie that back to any questions on costs. So that was the purpose of doing that was to give everybody comfort that we had still a very strong onsite consumer behavior. We don't have the date on amputates yet for the summer, but again, taking that as the leading indicator, we feel good about it. And we think there's a long runway. We talked in February about how we still think that there's 30%, 40%, 50% increase in our onsite spend, as we do a better job on some of the VIP and premium offers and do a better job of how it is we're marketing and selling upsell opportunities on site.
Brandon Ross: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Glagola: Yes. Thanks for the question. Joe, on Latin America expansion, can we just unpack sort of the assessor guidance of delivering full year results in line with 2019 a bit more? I have, for my calculation, it's about like $500 million in revenue and $85 million in EBITDA. Is that correct? Is that sort of the baseline, and then typically you guys have been able to organically grow on your M&A 70%, 80% plus in the first couple years after consolidating that asset. Is that a similar type of growth that we should expect as analysts in our model?
Joe Berchtold: So I guess, let me break into a couple of pieces there. So this year we expect both Mexico and Latin America broadly to do well. I think that it would be a very strong Latin America year relative to '19, even without OCESA, having OCESA only makes it all that much stronger. Your numbers aren't terribly far off. You have to kind of triangulate. They're within the general ballpark of what our numbers would be for '19 and therefore for '22. I don't think we're ready to start declaring the specifics of what OCESA is going to be in '23 or '24 yet. Give us a little time to get there with them and we'll keep you updated on it. But we do see Mexico and Latin America more broadly, certainly as one of our great growth drivers over the next few years.
Stephen Glagola: Okay. And then thanks for that.
Michael Rapino: Both concerts -- both concerts and Ticketmaster, just to remind you, it's a huge upside in Mexico and ticketing and that we, we're only a 30% owner to Mexico. And now that we own it, we've already had the team down there. We're upgrading, they're still living on a green screen with not much feature functionality. So big upside secondary, etcetera, to add in Mexico and throughout Europe. So big growth opportunity, both in concerts and sponsorship and ticketing.
Stephen Glagola: Okay. Thanks Michael. And just one more on modeling questions for the rest of this year and guidance, you have these two, obviously the big Rock and Rio festival scheduled this year that had a outsize impact. I believe on the sponsorship segment in 2019. Just, how should we be thinking about that impact on the P&L this year? And then also, this is the fourth consecutive quarter now with ticketing AOI margins above 40%. Is this -- I believe this is probably just driven because most of the business in the US and UK right now, but is that something, we can expect throughout the remainder of the year, or do you expect that to moderate closer to the mid-thirties as the year progresses?
Joe Berchtold: In terms of Rock and Rio, I think we've got that again this year. So I think it would be consistent with '19 in that regard and in terms of Ticketmaster you're right. It's continuing to do great. The margins are flowing through it is benefiting from the US waiting if you will right now, but with the cost taken out, we think it, this year probably be a high thirties margin when all is said and done, and you get some rebalancing with some of the international, which is a lower margin business.
Stephen Glagola: All right, appreciate it. Thank you, Joe. Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Katz: Hi afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. There was some earlier discussion around broad-based consumer trends, but I recall your investor event, there was a fair amount of talk about utilizing the premium end of pricing and platinum and other kinds of high end. Can you maybe unpack the price ranges on things and Joe, I know some of your comments were addressed more toward the average or even the value customer. Are you seeing any change at all, positive or negative at the high end?
Joe Berchtold: No, absolutely. The over the overall double-digit increase is driven by the high end across our major stadiums arenas. Amphitheatres, I think we've probably about doubled the number of tickets to go into what we call the platinum or market based pricing. So more than anything else is probably more of the tickets are getting market priced or closer to market priced, and then depending on the artist than the show, yes, it's also flexing upward from where it would've been historically, as we try to get closer to the true market price. Even as doing this, you can tell by our commentary about the size, growth of the secondary we've helped move $500 million to the artist this year, but I think the secondary has grown more on our tickets. So it's not that we're out there capturing every penny even while getting these increases this year, but we're continuing to try to move in that direction.
David Katz: Understood. And if I may follow up in a different direction it's the first time probably in 2.5 years that we would even raise it. But how are you thinking about leverage and cap structure and how much cash versus how much debt. Is that, I see a pattern going back a number of years, but any change in how you might think about that going forward?
Joe Berchtold: Well, I think one of the things that gives us a lot of comfort is that over 85% of our debt is fixed rate. So we're sitting at 4.3% in a pretty fixed debt structure with short-term increases having a fairly limited impact on us. So I think we're feeling fine about our about our total debt level. Our total coverage based on our AOI, I think continues to be very robust and we don't have any concerns about being able to grow in from an AOI standpoint and into our debt.
David Katz: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Benjamin Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. I have two questions. First, just on -- back on Ticketmaster, I think you guys talked about or had in the release 7 million new tickets one in the quarter, 14 last year. It's really strong in terms of adding new business. Can you talk a little bit about, any context to what kind of business you're adding, US versus international, venue type and what's driving that and whether you're seeing any increased competitive behaviour. We sort of hear about competition on the primary side, including on price, but it doesn't seem like it's affecting Ticketmaster share gains at all. So just be interested in some more color around the success there and whether this taste can keep up.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. I think the 7 million story is the same as the 17 million story. When you're at this scale, it's everything. International has been very strong, which has been driven by the dramatic improvements in the international product that we've had as we move to a single integrated platform. And that has further differentiated us, particularly internationally, relative to where we've been. At the same time, we've had continued success in the US and many of the discussions are product driven. The confidence that working with Ticketmaster, you're only going to have the best enterprise products in the best marketplace today, but the level of investment that we're making and the scale of the dollars being spent to build new product is unparalleled in its commitment to continuing to enhance for the teams and the artists and the fans, what their experience is gonna be. You always have price pressure, you have price competition and everything. There's no new news there. That's what you always have. It's always your job as a company to figure out how do I continue to create my product so that it's differentiated so that it reduces the price. And then how do I continue to get more efficient and make money in other ways off my flywheel so that overall my aggregate economics continue to improve, nothing new there.
Benjamin Swinburne: Got it. And then just on back on the macro, I know everyone's concern given some of the other earnings results we've seen in this quarter. Your sponsorship business, Joe, I think it's largely sort of longer term contracts. I think you might have some, kind of display advertising in there. We've heard some of the big digital ad players that businesses have softened here in the second quarter. Can you just remind us how long duration that business is for you guys and if you're seeing any signs of softening in any part of your sponsorship business has given what we've heard from other companies. Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: We're not seeing any signs of softening. Michael gave you some of the numbers on these -- on the large relationships that we have, the million dollar plus relationships that have been our focus on growing the number of those relationships, the breadth of assets that we provide to them, and just how much of our sponsorship base they represent. So they're coming at it from multiyear, multi-asset saying we want to be present at the festival at the amphitheatre. We also are going to have an online presence. It's a much higher level of integration than just a simple ad by with some of the other players out there. So we're not seeing that impact at all.
Michael Rapino: And, Ben, just to jump in also on, I know you had brought it up also, our no-show rates I know that's always been some rumour go out there, but as we stated in our release, we're seeing no challenges at all. People are showing up to the shows. We are showing similar to 2018, '19, your regular low digit no-show rate of people that don't make it to the show. But back to normal, people come and drum to those shows no issues at all in terms of showing up.
Benjamin Swinburne: Yep. I saw that you, Michael.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Sundby: Hey guys. Thanks for the question. You mentioned 20 new Venues in the pipeline and 38 new festivals, I guess, starting on the, the festival side is something coming from OCESA. How many of these are, or maybe first time and were you able to pick up a, a large number here of festivals that struggle during COVID and then on the venue side, how should we think about the, the timing of those opening up and maybe the size in terms of overall staying capacity that could add.
Michael Rapino: On the festival side, we, we have a, a few great festival companies in Europe and America. And part of the success of live nation has been about organic growth, continuing to grow the business finding you know, new market shares, new global entry points and festivals being a big part of regenerating our business. So we're always looking to add every year and let our festival companies launch new ideas. And this year we've had some great success. One of our young companies, C3, it's been in business with a strong festival promoter, Jeff Shoeman. We launched a, when we were, when we were young festival out of Vegas, we hoped to sell 40,000 tickets. We sold over 160,000 tickets in Vegas; so huge success in a brand new festival. So we love those stories. We encourage all of our festival entrepreneurs to take swings every year. We usually have a 50% success rate. Some of those go on to be great brands. Some you fail fast to move on. So 38 was a indicator. I'll let you know, we have a large, a hundred plus portfolio of festivals around the world, like amphitheater and Venues. There are high margin business because of sponsorship, food, and beverage. And not only do we look to acquire and bolt on when we can, but we are a big machine of organically creating new festivals that the majority of our growth and this year we're back to full speed on letting our entrepreneurs go swing and create some new revenue for us.
Ryan Sundby: Great. How about here Venues?
Michael Rapino: Joe? Joe can jump in. It's a similar story. We're just starting, continuing, I mean, Venues would be one that we didn't really slow-down during COVID because they have a longer lead time. So if you, you look at our venue nation division that we highlighted in the investor day and kind of our continued focus around our 300 plus Venues that we operate around the world. I think we said we have probably 75 in the pipe and we annually open up probably about 20 new festivals around the world. So we're on plan, continuing to move on that aggressive front to continue expand on a global basis club theatre and a theatre. We just opened a beautiful arena in Austin last week to record sales, record results proud of that one and more to come. So continued opening and phasing throughout the years we've been doing historically.
Ryan Sundby: Great. And then it sounded like 72% of tickets were, were digital and Q1 versus 33% in, '19. I know most of the attendance this quarter though came from the U.S. and the UK, which I assume led the, the digital rollout. So I guess how should we think about digital penetration moving forward? And I maybe, can you talk a little bigger picture if you, if you're starting to act on, on that data that you're collecting?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, I you're right. It's helped a little bit. I still think we end the year probably around 80% globally. A lot of this has to do with not just the infrastructure on our end, but rolling out the access control new systems that have to get deployed for each of these Venues and doing that on a global basis, just with some of the supply chain in terms of getting those pieces in place. It'll take a little bit of time, but we're making great progress and we're already acting on the data. Just saw some of the information yesterday, looking at how we're using it for more effectively targeting the marketing. So when you, your email from live nation on what concerts, it's much more tailored to you than it was in 2019 as a result, the click through rates and the buy rates are up substantially. And then as we get into the summer, and we have people going to our operated amphitheater as our operated festivals, we expect that we'll be able to use that digital connection to more effectively market upsell connect sponsors with fans. So we'll see all of that activity beginning in much more earnest in the in this year.
Joe Berchtold: Great. Hear, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Hargan with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Hargan: Thank you. Two conceptual questions, firstly the end  it feels like it's a nice digital memorabilia compliment in experience versus something that someone buys it at Sotheby's and it's right in your wheelhouse. You know, what innovation are you seeing with the NBA this season in the NFL? And there's a way to really personalize it even more and have more variety? And then secondly, at your investor today, you talked a lot about hyper slicing nomenclature sounds very Elon Musk, does that also have some affectability to Mexico with ESSA and even some of the European markets? I know you talked about that really keeping the U.S. around 40% of the TA, but some of those other larger markets, it seemed like you could apply that concept of local act acts over a period of time? Thank you.
Michael Rapino: Yeah. On the NFT, I think I think we're deep into discussions and product development and testing. Like all of the leagues are doing, we have a, a dual a lens. If you want to call it on Ticketmaster side, we are working in hand in tandem with the NFL and NBA on minting, all of the tickets. We did all the super bowl tickets through Ticketmaster that were NFT souvenirs. We're doing it for the teams. We've been working with mark Cuban and others. So on the Ticketmaster side, we're getting to see all of the best versions of what some sports teams and brands are doing with NFTs. On the concert side, we've worked on our artist management division with our artists and seen some of the versions that they're looking at, whether it's in the metaverse, whether it's a fortnight or whether it's a song on an NFT. So we're looking and learning on that side and on the live nation side the NFC is really just an extension of what someone mentioned earlier, the digital ticket. I mean, the, the most important thing for us overall is to have identity tied to the ticket. So, so moving from a PDF ticket where we knew nobody, it had no contract, it had no rights, it had no carry on value, moving to a block-chain, digital NFT ticket in general that just opens up the doors to first having identity tied to the ticket. So we can have a better conversation with you. And we think NFT to that ticket, we can create a community of value and look at and ways to add value to you on an ongoing basis if you've opened up and been part of the live ticket stub NFT today. So we're we think it's great opportunity to add more value to the relationship with that purchaser. And we're going to, we're going to keep experiment ideas on that front. The second question, I, I didn't quite even I didn't hear it well enough. Yeah. Joe and jump in on you.
Joe Berchtold: I'm Sorry. On the hyperly thing. No, I got it. I got it. Yeah. So on the hyper local strategy that we've been talking about absolutely applies in throughout Europe, throughout Mexico, Latin America, all of the markets in we're going into each country, we're establishing a beachhead, getting to some scale, leveraging that scale to then say, what are each of the specific markets that we can go to and expand the operation. So that's a core part. Somebody was talking earlier how we, when we make the acquisition, we grow it substantially. Well, our, our, with Germany, when we grew in, they were operating in two cities and then selling off the con the concert in all the other cities that there are 10, 12 cities in Germany where you could easily have the population to route your chore through. So that became the focus and that's how we grew that business. So we'll be following that playbook globally. It is a large part of when you look at the Tam and why the Tam is so large, it's because all of that demand exists through so many different markets, not just the ones where we're historically bringing shows to. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Barton Crockett: Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. You know, I wanted to ask a little bit about this 60 tour marker booked already for 2023, which is you know, sounds compelling, but, but it'd be great to have a little bit more context. And I was wondering if this might kind of get at it. Can you give us a sense of at this time of 2019, how many tours, if any, did you have already booked for 2021? That might be one way to look at it. And secondarily if you've got 60 tours already booked for 2023, how many do you have booked right now for 2022?
Michael Rapino: I, I think I can give you generalities to make you feel good that '23 going to look good. I mean, that's obviously what you're, you're trying to get at. So I think in, if you look at '20 to your point of how many did we have booked, or how many would we be reviewing for, for, for a historic year at this time period, we would, we would be about double where, where a historic marker would be if you want to use that as a, as a basic line. So, 60 would be a, a fabulous number to be talking about this time of year for a, for a next year activity. So that's, that kind of gives you a kind of a robust feeling of what's what '23 will look to be.
Barton Crockett: Okay. And switch gears a little bit on the recession question. You know, back in the, the last kind of the great recession. Oh, 8 or 9 or 10 were concerts in your experience at live nation, more, a lagging indicator or a leading indicator, I would guess lagging. And so if there is a recession impact, you might be the last to feel it, but I was wondering if you had any thoughts about that?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, it was a lagging indicator. It didn't hit till 2010. We had it for one summer. And I think we had a lot less data on the market then, than we have now, I talked about the secondary market and how that provides such great transparency today into the specific supply demand dynamics, the pricing, not just in the front of the house, but through the whole building. We didn't have that back then. So we were making a lot of decisions, a lot more blindly. So we have better information. We're set up to be much more nimble in terms of how we respond to that information. And again, that was the one year out of not just the last recession, but if you look over the past 30 years at a handful of different recessions, it was the one year when there was any
Operator: Decline in our business.
Barton Crockett: Okay. That's great. Thank you,
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session, and I'd like to turn a call back to Mr. Joe behold and Michael Rapino for closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: All right, everybody. Thank you. Have a great summer. We'll talk soon.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. The past two years have only reinforced the power of live music, and it’s been great to see artists and fans reconnecting at scale around the world. Over the course of 2021, we saw the strength of live events. The year started in the midst of the pandemic, but by summer fans were returning to shows, and by the end of the year, we had a record pipeline of concerts, ticket sales and advertising commitments for 2022. Restarting our concerts business in the second half of the year, we put over 17,000 concerts for 35 million fans in 2021, mainly in the U.S. and UK markets. In the final five months of the year, in the U.S. and UK, we had over 15 million fans attend our outdoor events: festivals, stadiums, and amphitheaters, nearly 25% higher than during the same period in 2019. Through the ramp up, we saw demand driven price increases, particularly with platinum and other front of the house ticket pricing. Fans continue to seek the best tickets, and the ongoing rapid growth of the secondary market indicates there’s more room to grow. Fans on-site also continued spending more, with average per fan revenue up double digits for the year relative to 2019 levels, across each of amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. And as shows came back, so did the desire of brands to connect to our fans. As a result, sponsorship and advertising AOI was roughly the same for the second half of 2021 as it was in 2019, which was a record level. This interest came from a mix of expanding long-term relationships with brands such as Bacardi, Heineken and O2, as well as adding new partners, including Coinbase, Hulu and Cinch. Our ticketing business had the dual benefit of strong ticket sales for events in 2021, while also being the first of our businesses to benefit from our 2022 pipeline. Ticket sales were at a record pace across every metric with October, November and December being our top three months ever for ticketing GTV, excluding refunds. And the fourth quarter and second half of the year also set records for a quarter and six-month period. At the same time, we continued to reorganize our business globally and improve our operations, establishing a more nimble and lower cost company. Looking to 2022 and beyond, with the strength in ticket sales, not surprisingly, we are seeing every leading indicator for 2022 up relative to 2019, reinforcing our confidence that we will have a record year in 2022 that sets us up for growth over the next several years. Helping accelerate our growth this year is the acquisition of OCESA, which gives us immediate scale in Mexico and establishes another path into a broader Latin American market. Looking at the leading indicators, starting with show count through February, we are up 30% relative to 2019 across our large venue shows, for stadium, amphitheater, arena and festivals. Ticket sales through mid-February, we have sold 45 million tickets for shows this year, up 45% from 2019. We already have eight artists selling over 500,000 tickets for tours this year, including Bad Bunny, Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish. And fans are coming to the shows, our most recent data over the past month indicates no-show rates at our concerts in the U.S. are back to 2019 levels, eliminating any lingering questions on the resilience of fan demand. Along with our fan growth, we continue building the portfolio of venues we operate, now at 320 globally, as we net added 31 additional venues in 2021, approximately half of which came through the OCESA acquisition. Building our venue portfolio enables us to more rapidly grow our show count and fan base in 2022, and over the next few years, and positions us to drive on-site spending more widely while also providing additional assets to brand partners. Our sponsorship and advertising pipeline is similarly set for a strong 2022, up double digits through mid-February relative to 2019, with 80% of our planned revenue for the year committed. Taking this strong activity pipeline and combining it with our more efficient cost structure, I expect 2022 to deliver record financial performance overall for each division. The two-year wait for artists and fans is over. Never have the tailwinds to our business been so strong, and I believe this is just the start of what will be the strongest multi-year period for the concert industry. With that I will let Joe take you through more details on our results.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the unique seasonality we experienced last year, I’ll provide an overview of our annual results, but also give some specifics on the fourth quarter as we believe that is a better indicator of what lies ahead for 2022 and beyond. Overall, our AOI of $324 million for the year was $1.3 billion better than 2020, led by an improvement of $800 million in ticketing, over $400 million in concerts and $150 million in sponsorship. For the fourth quarter, we delivered AOI of $160 million, led by a record quarterly AOI results in ticketing and strong performance in sponsorship. On the balance sheet, we ended the year with $1.5 billion in free cash and $2.3 billion in event-related deferred revenue. This deferred revenue is almost twice the level of Q4 2019, giving us one of several leading indicators for how strong 2022 is lucky. Let me give a bit more color on each division and then I will give you more on the 2022 leading indicators. First, in concerts, we had 16 million fans attend 9,300 events in the quarter, continuing to be led by the U.S. and the UK, which accounted for almost 90% of these fans. The strength of fan spending we discussed in Q3 continued through Q4, with consistent increases in ticket pricing and average per fan spending. Concert ticket pricing was up 11% overall for the year relative to 2019 14% in North America. As demand in many major venue types: amphitheaters, stadiums and festivals showed strong increases as we put more tickets in market-based platinum and VIP pricing offers. Similarly, average fan spending at our amphitheaters ended up in line with last quarter’s commentary at $37 for the year, up 25% from 2019. While this was helped by fewer promotions, it was largely driven by higher purchases. His average fan spending increased across the Board from food and beverage, ticket add-ons, VIP and parking. For our major festivals, average spending per fan also rose double digits, largely as a result of higher food and beverage in VIP sale. Finally, as we also noted last quarter, operating costs per fan were up due to lower operating scale from fewer shows per venue, along with labor cost increases. But overall, our contribution margin per fan was up double digits as pricing on-site spending another revenue more than covered any incremental costs. Next sponsorship, largely followed concerts returned to activity over the course of the year and into the fourth quarter. As a result, 2021 sponsorship and advertising AOI of $242 million was about two-thirds of 2019 levels, while Q4 AOI of $115 million was 39% higher in 2019 Q4. This strength comes across on-site and online, as both parts of the business delivered record Q4 AOI. Again, our large festivals were a standout performer, increasing sponsorship revenue per fan by over 10% versus the same festivals in 2019. Finally, ticketing was clearly the star of the quarter, delivering $212 million of AOI, which surpassed its previous best quarter Q3 of this year by over 20% and was 60% higher than Q4 2019, which was our previous best Q4. Ticketing success was across the Board. Let me give you a few key statistics for the quarter. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds, were 65 million tickets, coming in even higher than Q4 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV, excluding refunds, was $6.6 billion, 20% higher than Q4 2019. This was driven by concerts and sporting events, whose GTV were up 22% and 55%, respectively. Price increases help drive the GTV levels, with average ticket prices up 17% for the fourth quarter relative to Q4 2019, in concerts and sporting event, ticketing, pricing, each app approximately 20%. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing, with transacted GTV, excluding refunds, up 16% and 49%, respectively. And we added 17 million net new fee-bearing tickets from new clients to the marketplace in 2021, with most of that inventory coming online this year. And finally, our ongoing cost management help drive ticketing into Q4 results operating at substantially lower fixed costs in Q4 2019, as we both structurally reduced costs and also held the line on other costs being added back until we saw ticket sales fully return. As we look to 2022, first OCESA will benefit full year results as Mexico seen live events starting to return. Most notably their contribution will flow through our sponsorship and ticketing division. Looking at our leading indicators through mid-February 1, confirmed large venue show bookings were up 30% overall and double digits for each amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Second, we have sold 45 million tickets for concerts this year, up 45% from this point in 2019. While it’s too early to have much data on ticket pricing, early indicators continue to show the inelasticity of demand for the best tickets. Looking at our top 10 concert tours this year versus this point in 2019, average pricing is up over 20% as our average platinum allocation has increased substantially. And looking at secondary ticketing demand in Ticketmaster, five of their top 10 highest demand events ever have taken place in 2022, signaling that secondary markets continue to grow even faster than primary tickets. On the sponsorship side, commitments are up double digits from this point in 2019 prior to including OCESA. And overall, we have more than 80% of our planned sponsorship net revenue for 2022 already committed. A few other 2022 points, we continue to maintain a lower cost structure, and this takes into account labor cost increases within our perimeter as at the start of 2020. But obviously, adding new businesses, including OCESA, will come with additional fixed costs. And from a seasonality standpoint, we’re going to be even more Q2 and Q3-driven this year than usual. Q1 activities historically very arena-driven with limited outdoor activity. And as we plan the arena tours for this year, we had most of them starting Q2 instead of Q1 to give the international markets time to fully open. It appears we plan that correctly, we continue to be on track with those plans, and certainly the leading indicators suggests the full year will be at record fan levels, but with somewhat lower concert activity this Q1 versus 2019. In anticipation of the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with two-thirds of this spent on revenue-generating projects. In addition, we ended 2021 with $2.1 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to invest in growth. We are comfortable with our current leverage, and we’ll continue to reevaluate our balance sheet on an ongoing basis. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
David Karnovsky: Hey, thank you. Some of forward commentary wrote 45% increase in ticket sold versus 30% increase in large venue supply. I’m wondering to understand more of what you’re seeing on the demand side, given your own customer data, the average concert goers buying more shows than they were buying earlier. Are you seeing more first-time concert goers, any additional you could provide would be great?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, this is Joe. We’re certainly seeing them buy earlier. We’re seeing these numbers benefit from the pent-up supply and the pent-up demand that exists out in the marketplace. I think given that we’re just getting going, it’s probably too early to call whether they’re going to multiple concerts more likely, I think, we’re going to have to play through the year and see more data before we can really make that determination.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And then you told the assessment for a few months now, would just be interested to hear any update on how you view the asset in terms of revenue synergies or how maybe their cost structure looks relative to when you first executed the deal in 2019? And then could you provide an update on how we should think about the Mexico market ramp-up?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, I think we continue to be very excited by assessment. We’ve spent a lot of time with their team. We do think the top line opportunities are exactly as we’ve been laying out. First, we have the opportunity to bring more of our terrain through Mexico was a natural part of our terrain activities. And then second, because of their great strength with LatinX, which are red hot right now, more opportunities to build our market share in the Latin business and bring those into not just Mexico, but in the U.S. So we’re excited about that top line opportunity. They’re getting going as we get into Q2, they’ll get going first with festivals, and then ramp-up the touring business. We expect them to have a very good year, this year. Again, the way they’re structured, their economics really flow through – their – if you look at them, their sponsorship and their ticketing divisions, but we expect them to have a very solid year.
David Karnovsky: And anything on the cost side, I mean, you see on their commentary sort of indicated taking out a lot of expenses during the pandemic as well. I wasn’t sure if we should be thinking of the kind of AOI structure that business is different than maybe it exists to pre-pandemic?
Joe Berchtold: I think it’s probably premature to change your cost structure assumptions with them. As we further integrate Ticketmaster, I would expect that and as we get the concert machine more finely tuned that expected, but it’s – the first focus is driving the top line. if we get the top line right, that business will do great, and then we’ll follow with costs. We’re not going to start with cost because you can’t pick it – you can’t catch up this year.
Michael Rapino: And it’s Michael stepping in. And also, we know this company very well. Alex , the CEO is a professional. You don’t get to be the third largest promoter in the world without being kind of an all round good businessman and operator. So he runs an incredible good business. But yes, like myself and our team through COVID, he was able to dig in and decide what’s – where’s some rust and some bureaucracy? And how can we streamline some of the business? So like us, I would expect him to hold on to some cost savings and run more efficient, regardless of the merger. And we think now together, we’ve already started the process of how do we elevate the ticket business? How do we upgrade the software? How do we introduce secondary? How do we excel the hospitality and sponsorship business? So I’m sure there’s some cost savings, but we’re more excited about, as Joe said, we think we can bring another gear to his already well-run machine.
David Karnovsky: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great, thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit more about international and maybe from Michael, could you give us an update on when you expect concerts to resume at scale across your global footprint? I know you laid out a timeline late last year. But I was curious if that changed at all, given the latest COVID wave? And then if all that goes according to plan, how do you expect your international business in 2022 will compare to 2020 – 2019?
Michael Rapino: You know, and I will preface here. We have our Investor Day tomorrow. So we’re going to dig into all of these topics probably in much more detail. So if we’re a little shorter tonight, just expect us tomorrow, you’ll have a much more opportunity to dig into all of these levers. International, it looks like everything is opening up fast and we see a full summer/spring business across the globe. Australia and New Zealand have only been – has been the only real I would say slower some of the Pacific Rim a little slower in some of the markets, China, Japan. But for our business, we think most of the business across Europe, international, South America, we start Coldplay March 18 in Costa Rica going down to Latin America. We believe most of our big Lollapalooza is in South America in March and April will happen. And all of our summer festivals in Europe are scheduled to happen. So it looks like 70% to 80% of the business around the world will be open, little bit of Pacific Rim might have some delays.
Stephen Laszczyk: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just one on sponsorship and advertising. Could you maybe give us an idea on what the remaining inventory in 2022 looks like? Is it inventory from earlier in the year, later in the year? What types of tours are formats? And then I know some of your sponsorship and advertising relationships can be multi-year in nature. Is there anything you can tell us about how the funnel shaping up for 2023 and beyond?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, in terms of remaining inventory, as you know, a lot of our inventory is what we create and what our sponsorship team has the ability to come up with ideas for how we expand into new categories, and how we take existing categories and break them down in pieces. So we don’t feel generally speaking inventory constrained. The team is often working on a variety of areas, fintech and others that we think can steer still deliver a lot this year and into next year. As Michael said, we’ll get more into that tomorrow. But we still think there’s a great runway in that business. And as you also noted, a lot of these deals are multi-year. So as we establish a new baseline this year, we just have the opportunity to keep growing from that next year and beyond.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please go ahead.
Brandon Ross: Yeah. Thank you, guys. So ticket pricing for the top 10 tours you said was up, I think, 20% over 2019, and we definitely took notice when you use the word inelasticity in your prepared remarks. Platinum is obviously a big part of what you’re doing there. Can you frame where you are in unlocking tailwinds from Platinum tickets specifically? What percentage of major artists are you using it? And how much further impact do you see platinum having over time?
Joe Berchtold: Well, I think, again, Brandon, you’ll be there tomorrow. Well I think you just have to look at the size of the prize right now. I mean, if you look at it, just from a secondary perspective, how much unrealized underpriced are the tickets, unrealized pricing opportunity, if you want to call it. So I would say right now, Platinum is adopting a great tool to get a higher ticket price, but we still have very low penetration across a global business, huge upside still.
Brandon Ross: Okay. And then there have been a lot of reports about insurance rates going up, especially because of COVID and the Travis Scott incident, et cetera. Can you comment on how impactful you expect that to be to your cost structure this year and going forward?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, this is Joe. We see what everybody else sees, which is yes, insurance costs going up. We don’t think it’s material to the business overall. I think we’re in a good position as it relates to inflation more broadly. If you look at inflation of inputs versus your ability to price on the outputs, I think, we’re in a very good position that while you have some price pressures on your inputs, whether it’s insurance or labor. We have, for your first question, a much greater level of pricing ability on the outside, which led us as we talked about, use the same logic as we had last summer at the amps, still drove CM per fan up double digits. So we’re watching every cost is everybody else’s, we understand which ones are movie where, and we’re just figuring out how we make sure we’re pricing overall to to keep our AOI.
Brandon Ross: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just two interesting things I wanted to go back to and hope you could elaborate on. One is, you talked about the lower cost structure and you said that, I think, Joe, that it includes some labor cost increases. Can you just elaborate a bit more on what kinds of labor costs those is – and those are and where they are from in magnitude, et cetera?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. We like every business. I’ve seen employees are demanding some higher wages as you’ve come back from COVID. And as we built our cost – structural cost savings, we knew that was going to be the case. And we built that in and we talked in the past about the levels of those cost savings. So I just rather than get into every quarter trying to reconcile for you guys, well, how does your cost of living adjustment this year impact your structural savings? I want to make it clear we’re delivering those savings, having expected that there was going to be some labor cost increases as we were going through, no different for us than anybody else.
David Katz: Understood. And the second issue I wanted to touch on is I think you mentioned that the secondary ticket market is going faster than primary. I’m curious, what’s driving that and what order of magnitude there as well?
Joe Berchtold: Well, yeah, it’s the same point as what Brandon asked about. It’s the inelasticity of demand for the best tickets, plus the general overall desire for fans to get back to live events. So if they didn’t buy a ticket for the sporting event, or for the concert, they missed out, they’re buying it on secondary, and they’re paying whatever it takes on those best tickets to get in. So as we strive on the primary to be pricing it such that to bring the dollars back the content to the artists, so we think deserve every dollar for their performance. We’re doing that through platinum and through other tools. As we do that, secondary continues to grow rapidly. We’re not shrinking secondary yet. So we have the opportunity to continue to move pricing and primary as I was talking about earlier, while looking at secondary and figuring out how far do we go.
David Katz: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please state your question.
Stephen Glagola: Hi, thanks for the question. There’s been some reports that the industry has been recently seen 20% no-show rates at concerts. And you noted in your prepared remarks and no-show rates that Live Nation promoted concerts in the U.S. are back to 2019 levels. Just want to ask like what are those levels if you can pinpoint it? And can you reconcile maybe if there is a divergence between what you’re seeing and what the industry is seeing, and how no-show rates are trending internationally? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: So let me give you some facts on that. Thanks for that question. Because I think there’s been a lot of reporting by anecdote out there, as opposed to reporting by collective facts. And I don’t think our experience is any different than the industry is, as a total. I think that on occasion, you have aberrations for a variety of reasons. But just to give you a macro feel, I’ll give you the – for first of all, arenas in 2019, if you look at the number of people that showed up for a concert versus the number of people that bought tickets, it ran at 93% in 2019. That number thus far, in 2022, over the past six weeks is running at 91%. So not materially different from the 93% for the total of 2019. For our theaters and clubs, the smaller shows, you tend to have a slightly higher no-show rate. And that number was 87% in 2019. It’s running at 83% in 2022. So I think if you first of all recognize that there were a number of shows that have taken place over the past few months that were rescheduled, and when shows get rescheduled, people will naturally forget about the show or have a conflict different than what they originally had. It’s probable that accounts for all or almost all of that difference in the attendance level. So we don’t think that reporting is at all accurate.
Stephen Glagola: Appreciate the color, Joe. And can you just provide…
Michael Rapino: Just had that color that I remember reading those articles, they dramatize, I think they were saying as 15%, 20% weren’t showing, but again, they weren’t taking into account that on a normal year, 7%, 8% of people don’t show up to shows. So you’re already starting at that level. So if you look at what our current data says, we’re basically back to 2019 levels and people are showing up at the same rates are not showing up in that 7% to 8%. The history has always kind of shown.
Stephen Glagola: Thanks, Michael. And can you guys just provide on Q4 concerts, the AOI margin was a little bit, the loss I think was a little wider and some expectations. I know you have – I think you have advertising dollars that flowed through there. But can you maybe just any comments on that, which drove that? And then how should we think about Q4 and I know it’s far away, but 2022 as well as that could be just similar cadence of losses in that quarter for concerts?
Joe Berchtold: I mean, I think if you look at Q4 versus 2019, you – Q4 is generally a loss. It’s a lower activity quarter. You have, as you noted, prepaid advertising running through. If you look at our fan base in 2021 versus 2019, Q4 back that off. It’s not surprising, you’re still carrying your fixed cost plus you have your end advertising all against the lower volume.
Stephen Glagola: All right, Thanks, Joe, and looking forward to the Investor Day Tomorrow.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ben Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions. First, Michael, I also noticed you mentioned the secondary market growing faster than primary a couple of times in your prepared remarks. And I was thinking of Ticketmaster as the clear market leader in primary and I know you’re in secondary, but I – maybe I just don’t think about Ticketmaster as the leading, is particularly focused on the secondary market. I’m wondering if you could just talk about whether you see that accurately as I described it, or if you think you – there’s anything you would change in the strategy for that business going forward, given what we’re seeing in secondary, I noticed Joe also mentioned, we haven’t seen the secondary shrink yet. So maybe that’s tells me the answer. But I’m just wondering if you guys are pivoting at all, as you think about the growth of those two parts of the ticketing business, because it does seem like secondary is quite robust?
Michael Rapino: Yeah, I would – we’ll get into this tomorrow, again, in our slides, but we have the two sides of the equation here, right? Ultimately, long-term. I don’t think secondary is a great business, because I believe content will figure out how to price it better. So on the concert side, we’re waking up every day, our goal isn’t to increase secondary sales, it’s to increase the gross for the artists in the show. That’s why we talked about platinum and VIP and better analysis for the artist to capture more of the dollars. So – and we’ve seen that over the last 5, 10 years, every year, the artist is capturing more of it. Now that doesn’t mean that it’s an efficient market yet. It’s going to take some more time for the artist to be more comfortable charging those prices where the market is affected, but it’s happening you see it over time. And then 5, 10 years from now, if you are an artist manager, you wouldn’t want to be waking up seeing lots of secondary tickets for your artists captured outside of your bundle. So our job mostly is to figure out how to get all of that secondary into the primary bucket for the artist. So they make the dollars and then we, obviously, that fires our flywheel. But the reality is, it’s not an efficient market yet. And most of secondary is really in the sports business. So when we talk about the ticket side growing, we were never in secondary, as you said, when we took this business over. We integrated it, we built it, and we – and then we ramped it up fast for all of our sports clients. So we’re the official secondary of the NFL, the NBA of the NHL, and others. And we have been able to grow that business over the last few years, fairly well in the sports business where most of the dollars are. So that business though, again, continues to be a business where the sports teams are getting more and more dollars directly. The NBA, the NFL are all looking at ways to capture the secondary for the team and/or for the league. So we think it’s a business right now that is in transition, lots of dollars outside of the content. We think long-term content captures more of it. But we’re also going to be part of that marketplace that if a fan or somebody wants to trade and sell their tickets, then we want to make sure we’re part of that vertical solution at our marketplace.
Ben Swinburne: Got it. That makes sense. And then just wanted to go back to the forward bookings, numbers and leading indicators you guys talked about the 45% and the 30%. We heard some stats at least directionally similar on NSGs call, and I’m wondering if there’s a timing element to this. Just should we be extrapolating those into full year growth rates? Or are we seeing some activity happening sooner because we’re still sort of dealing with the pandemic hangover or the pandemic? And so concerts are filling up the calendar sooner and going on sale sooner. I’m just wondering if there’s any sort of caveat you’d want to give us to think about translating those into a forecast? That makes sense?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, I certainly don’t think of it as a caveat. But unquestionably, you’ve got a timing advantage this year, you’ve got a benefit from some shows that moved and you have a timing in general of a wide open market that we put shows on sale earlier. But that said, we look at all of that and we continue to see every indicator well up. So we think it’ll plateau or normalize some, but it’s still looking to be a very strong high growth relative to 2019.
Ben Swinburne: Yep, makes sense. Thanks, guys.
Joe Berchtold: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.
Ryan Sundby: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to follow-up on the 25% growth in the U.S. and UK fan base over the last five months. Are there any comparison issues there we should think through in terms of maybe show count or, or mix of festivals that got moved around? We set a pretty apples-to-apples comparison.
Ryan Sundby: Yeah, so just to be fair, that was the outdoor activity over the last five months of last year. So stadiums, amphitheaters and festivals, there was definitely some benefits. You got a few festivals like Electric Daisy that moved into the fourth quarter from May and we pushed the amphitheater season later in the year. So I wouldn’t try to take anything arithmetically from that as much as a very – 2021 was a year of very strong fan return to outdoor events. 2022 setting up to be a very strong fan return to every site, every sort of venue, every sort of event.
Ryan Sundby: Got it. That’s helpful. And then, in terms of the average fan revenue up double digits this year, I guess, I know, it’s kind of early to make a call last quarter, but now that you’ve had some more time to kind of look at the data there. Is that something you think you can hold on to permanently, or do you think this is some kind of indulgent spinning that we’re seeing here just that number?
Joe Berchtold: We think overall that number is real. We think that there is higher fan spending and there is greater fan acceptance of some higher pricing and there’s greater fan demand for real hospitality some higher end luxuries. We gave some specific math last time that wouldn’t have changed much in terms of what was the incremental span versus what was some mix issues, but it is largely what fans spending more money at out the shows and we think that continues.
Ryan Sundby: Okay. That’s good to hear. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
Jason Bazinet: If there was one mistake that I think investors make during COVID, it was sort of taking strength that we saw during the COVID period and sort of extrapolating it into future periods. And I’m just wondering, when you guys look at the very robust numbers that you’re putting up and all those leading indicators, how you guys sort of parsing out the sort of we’ve all been locked up for two years, or we’re going to go out and go crazy and spend a lot of money on food and beverage and merch and pay a higher price to get a premium seat versus everything sort of settling down to the sort of long run averages. Like do you think there’s that dynamic going on? Or do you think this is really like something a permanent shift in sort of consumers behavior?
Joe Berchtold: Well, I think the first thing you got to start with, Jason, is we don’t have a hockey stick. We’re not a COVID business that was floating along with near zero, and all of a sudden took off like a hockey stick. And everybody thought the hockey stick was going to continue forever. When you look at the long-term growth of the business, start with the most macro of GDP spending on goods shifting to experience, on increased demand for luxuries, on desire to go to concerts, on increased ticket pricing to concerts, everything on a global basis, s Michael said, all of this has been we’ve been drawing the same chart since 2010. And most of our investors today, I think, have been looking at that chart and saying the best predictor of the future is the past. And we had a very bumpy couple of years from macro over time. This is a company and this is an industry that is able between their tailwinds, their ability to drive increase market share, their ability to drive global, to bring the supply to the latent demand that exists in the marketplace to continue to grow the business.
Jason Bazinet: I don’t disagree with anything you said. If I can just sort of give you observations, we’re seeing like a record per caps in inside movie theaters and regional theme parks and things that don’t have that same sort of tailwinds.
Joe Berchtold: But Jason, had those businesses that they tell you for the past five years, they went from $18 to $22 to $24 to $26 to $29. I mean, do they tell you – do they give you for the past six years, every year how they were consistently delivering growth? So we could debate is that growth rate continued? Is there some normalization? Is there a reversion to a mean over a number of years? You can have all of those debates, but don’t frame it as a hockey stick, or somehow as the bumps in the road, the world is going to collapse back down to $18. I think you got to give us the credit that we’ve set a strategy and we’ve executed very consistently for a considerable period, and delivered on sustained growth. So yes, there’s some catch up of a couple of years, because 2020 and 2021 didn’t exist as much. Sure. But that doesn’t mean that they’re aberrations.
Jason Bazinet: I don’t mean aberrations, but I just I mean, maybe we’ll learn more about this tomorrow. But it just seems like to comp, if we have these really robust numbers this year, I’d just be curious what counsel you have, as we think about 2023 and 2024 to build off those elevated numbers not taking away from…
Joe Berchtold: So right now, I have in front of me a list of 40 some tours for 2023 that are either confirmed or in our pipeline. Normally, at this point, a year from earlier, we’d have a list of five to 10. So yes, we have a lot of confidence that 2023 and beyond look very good because there is a lot of pent-up supply, there is a lot of pent-up demand, and we expect it’s a multi-year run.
Jason Bazinet: Awesome. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question for today. And that also concludes today’s conference. All parties may now disconnect. Have a great evening. Thank you.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone. My name is Hector, and I will be your conference Operator on today's call. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino : Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. Live music roared back over the past quarter, driving all our business stipends to positive AOI for the first time in two years with companywide AOI of $306 million. The 2021 summer concert season rebounded quickly, with 17 million fans attending our shows in the quarter has returned to live, reflected tremendous pent-up demand. Festivals were large part of our return to live this summer with many of our festivals selling out in record time, and then overall ticket sales for major festivals was up 10% versus 2019.  Then we had a number of our tours are already sell over 500, 000 tickets for tours this year, including sellout tours by Harry Styles, Chris Stapleton, and others. In addition to increasing attendance, strong demand also enabled improving pricing with average amphitheater and major festival pricing up double-digits relative to 2019, and at our shows, fans spend at record levels with onsite spending per fan up over 20% in both amphitheaters and festivals compared to 2019.  We delivered these results with an operating environment that required us to wrap up quickly it's new health and safety protocols, and staff our frontline in a tight labor market. On the health and safety front, we set the industry standard by requiring proof of vaccine or testing for our shows, with no change in fan purchase behavior. More importantly, our protocols proved effective at mitigating major COVID disruptions to our business in the U.S. and UK, and allowed us to work in conjunction with local health officials to mitigate transmission risks from our events. On the labor front, we were able to set staffing requirements for our peak outdoor season without any show disruptions.  We also saw strong fan demand in our Ticketmaster results. We delivered its highest AOI quarter ever. Q3 was Ticketmaster's fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, led by sports legs restarting and concert on-sales for 2022 ramping up. In addition, Ticketmaster's secondary business delivered its highest GTV month in September, showing continued growth in the segment, even as artists and content owners continue shifting more of the value to primary sales. And as the fans came back, so did our brand partners who continue to seek to connect to the live music fan.  As a result, our sponsorship and advertising business delivered over $100 million in AOI for the quarter, the first time at this level since Q3 of 2019. Return of sponsorship and advertising has been largely driven by historic major partners, along with the addition of new brands, including Truly Hard Seltzer, as well as Coinbase and Solana in the Fintech segment. As we look forward to 2022, we are encouraged by all our leading indicators across each business. Through October our confirmed show count across amphitheaters, arenas, stadium shows are up double-digits, relative to the point in 2019 to 2020 shows.  And through mid-October, we have already sold 22 million tickets for our shows in 2022 and demand has been stronger than ever for many of these on sales, with a million tickets sold for each of the Coldplay and Red-Hot Chili Peppers tours, and several other tours already selling over 500,000 tickets. Ticketmaster is on sale for 2022 also reinforcing this demand, as we expect  transacted fee-bearing GTV to be at record level, even after already selling 65 million fee-bearing tickets for events next year. Ticketmaster also added clients represented in over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, further accelerating its growth on a global basis.  And our Sponsorship and Advertising business had similar success, with confirmed pipeline for 2022 up double-digits relative to this time in 2019 to 2020. At the same time, we are continuing our cost focused deliver $200 million in structural savings from our pre -pandemic 2020 plan, making us nimbler and better positioned to invest for future growth. As we get close to turning the page in 2021, I remain more convinced than ever in the power and potential of live entertainment, and the strength of our position.  No industry was more impacted by the pandemic over the last two years, and no industry has so proven the durability of its demand in the face of such disruption. I fully expect we will continue to have bumps in the road in the coming months. And it will take some time for international artists maturing on a truly global basis. But the fundamental strength of live entertainment and Live Nation has proven out and expect we will only continue to grow from here. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details on our results.
Joe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the detail on each business, a few points of context for the quarter, first, this is primarily a U.S. and UK driven quarter. These markets accounted for 95% of our fans in Q3 versus 75% in Q3 of 2019. And they represented 90% of fee-bearing GTV in Q3 versus 80% in Q3 of 2019. Second, our concerts activity primarily ramped up in August with 90% of our attendance for shows occurring in August and September.  Let me now go into more detail on the divisions. First concerts, as Michael noted, pricing and onsite spending was up for both our amphitheaters and our major festivals in the U.S. and UK. With almost 1200 amphitheater shows played off, these shows give us the best data set for comparing to 2019. So, give you more detail on trends for these shows, and in general, the same trends also hold for our festivals.  On pricing, average ticket pricing at our amphitheaters was up 17% to $63. There are 2 primary drivers to this. First, ticket pricing, including more platinum and VIP tickets for shows this year, increased average ticket pricing by $7. Secondly, our concert week promotion and other promotions were smaller-scale this year, which had an impact of $2 per ticket. Then for onsite spending, average fan spending was up 25% to $36. This growth came from a combination of more orders per fan, more items per order, and higher average spend per order. Many of our fans shifted to buying higher-priced products, which was part of our higher spend per order. And the shift to cashless also helped as card transactions have historically been larger than cash transactions, and this has held up as we shifted to 100% cashless. Finally, operating costs, including labor costs were up. These higher labor costs are driven by several factors, fewer shows per building, our accelerated ramp up to open the buildings this summer, new health and safety protocols and a generally tightened labor market.  At the same time as noted with increased average ticket price and higher onsite spending, we increased the contribution margin per fan and did so to such a level that our profitability per fan, net of operating expenses rose double digits. Turning now to Ticketmaster, as Michael said, Ticketmaster had a record AOI of a $172 million for the quarter, driven by its fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, and lower cost structure from its reorganization. Along with lower ramp-up labor costs as we accelerated activity faster than the return of staff.  Primary ticketing was driven substantially by concerts, which accounted for over 70% of fee-bearing GTV, while sports was the second largest category, and together they represented approximately 90% of all fee-bearing GTV. Geographically, North America accounted for 80% of fee-bearing GTV as activity remained limited internationally outside the UK. In secondary ticketing, we similarly saw concerts and sports account for over 90% of fee-bearing GTV, though in this case, sports were the primary driver with the launch of new football and basketball seasons.  Another contributor to our growth in ticketing is the continued signing of new clients with over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets added this year through the third quarter. These new client additions have been particularly strong internationally, accounting for 2/3 of our new client tickets. Finally, sponsorship AOI surpassed a $100 million in the quarter for the first time in 2 years as it again had available ad units at scale, both on-site and online. Like our other businesses, it was largely U.S. and UK driven together accounting for approximately 90% of total activity. And as activity resumed, we were also able to engage new sponsors, adding 8 new strategic sponsors in the quarter.  As we look to Q4, we see a continuation of the same trends we had in Q3. With concerts, we expect North America and the UK to continue ramping toward historical activity levels. While the rest of Europe and other international markets have limited activity given the lead time to plan concerts. With ticketing we expect a broader recovery as most European markets put stadium and arena tours on sale in Q4, enabling GTV levels that could approach Q4 2019 levels, despite 65 million fee-bearing tickets already being sold for 2022 events.  And while Q4 is typically a seasonally slower period for sponsorship, it too should benefit from concerts and ticketing sales ramping up. Let us now turn to our cash and cost management. We have free cash at $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes $450 million earmarked for the OCESA acquisition. This was our first quarter since 2019 where our cash contribution margin was higher than our cash burn, contributing a net $166 million in free cash. We also added $850 million in cash in the quarter through our $400 million drawdown of our Term A loan and $450 million equity raise for ASESA, mentioned previously.  We then had free cash reduced by $370 million, largely resulting from long-term deferred revenue shifting into short-term for show's next summer as we previously indicated would be happening. This improved cash position was also helped by our ongoing cost and cash management program as this year, we expect to reduce costs by $900 million and cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre -pandemic plans and on the cash, side excluding ASESA. As we prepare for 2022 plans, we remain confident that we have structurally reduced our operating costs by $200 million relative to our pre -pandemic 2020 plans.  A few other balance sheet items. Our deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. This is compared to $950 million at the end of Q3 of 2019, which gives us the best like for like view of the demand pipeline already in place. And then a reminder on our debt, that we continue with our liquidity covenants until we report Q4 this year, at which point we switch to a more traditional leverage test. Given our current liquidity and expected Q4 and 2022 activity levels, we do not anticipate any covenant issues through next year, and expect to continue investing in growth. With that, let me open the call for questions, Operator.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: Thank you. AC rob returned to target scale. What have you found about operating with a reduced cost structure, and how do you think about expense growth from here relative to pre -pandemic where I think you've noted you were just less focus as an organization on driving cost efficiencies? And then just a second question, how are you thinking about labor constraints as you ramp toward this huge wave supply coming in 2022, are there any concerns about finding out road as new crews and then to the extent costs you move up, who bears that  promoter or is that kind of goes to the artist. Thanks.
Joe Berchtold : Sure. Just on operating with a reduced cost structure, we had the benefit if you will, of really 0 base in our cost structure over the past year and a half, so -- and we've talked through at various points, a lot of it around Ticketmaster's globalization and how we revised our approach on the concert side. So, we're not seeing any issues in terms of operating with this renewed cost structure because it's been a pretty methodical laid out approach to how we want to run the business.  And then I think as we move forward and we continue to grow the business, our expectations are that the incremental profitability of our business is as good or better than it's ever been, and that there continues to be a long runway to do so. In terms of the labor constraint as we talked, we were able to put on all of our shows this year without any issues. Looking forward to next year at the end of probably -- we don't think that there's any issue in terms of getting back to the level of activity that we've had, or the level of activity that we're talking about, in terms of our pipeline of shows.  Ultimately, that is what the short-term constraining is in terms of why we won't be doing 45 mega tours, where you can't have 80% growth in a given year. It does have to do with some of the short-term ability to get your buses or to get your staff, but there's no long-term constraints for the growth. And we're still able to grow it in next year. In terms of the costs incurred, it's different pieces for different folks that the artist is generally responsible for their crew and their operations that they're being out on the road and we're responsible for the venues that we operate.
Michael Rapino : Just to add a little -- just to add texture to that, we would have absolutely in July or August with the idea that we had to instantly hire 20,000 people for summer amphitheaters usually would happen way back in April, we would've had concern but we surprisingly we're able to fully staff all of those jobs, as Joe said. Marginal cost increased a few million dollars.  So, we did see that the part-time seasonal workforce that needed to come back to help make the machine work were eager to get back. So, we didn't have that challenge. I think we're going to keep looking at how we do a better job of attracting and retaining them in today's environment, but we don't see that as a cost challenge, we think it's an exciting category so a lot of people like coming to work at the amphitheater, the club, the theatre, the lifestyle type job, and then as Joe said, we had no supply chain issues. The artist gets on stage, there's plenty of trucks, lights, staging, etc. to make the machine work on a global basis.
David Karnovsky: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Q - Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Brandon Ross: Hello. Thanks for taking the questions. Just -- you talked about your quarter and how the return to lives has been predominantly in the U.S. and UK. Wondering if you could give an update on when I know it's a big world out there, but when we can expect the rest of the world to get back to those 2019 levels and beyond that we've seen in the US and the UK. And then I have a follow-up.
Michael Rapino : Yeah, I'll jump in and Joe can jump. We've -- we had a global call yesterday this week with all of our different presidents. We're feeling very confident, obviously Canada, U.S., UK are fully open. Europe will be fully open by the end of the year. So, we'll have most of the main markets open into January. Pacific Rim, Latin America, all looks positive in terms of being open fully for international artists by April.  We think internationally, on a global basis by April the world will be moving around again. It doesn't overly affect our business short-term because most of the outdoor stadium festival business is summer time, so that will be all fully up and rolling. We have Lollapalooza starting in April in Latin America and Australia festivals. So, we think we'll be open for prime season, and we'll be rolling around indoors in the main markets of U.S., Europe, Canada, and the UK between now and April.
Brandon Ross: Right, and I wanted to focus a little on your O&O business. You talked about that prime season starting into April, and you extended your AMP season and festival season this year as the summer got off to a late start, do you plan on keeping that summer season extended going forward? Is that a way for you to own more of the fans?
Joe Berchtold : Yeah. It's a great point, right. You just forced yourself in this last 2 years to think differently and extract more value from your base, and we absolutely look at it now and see specially in most of Southern America we can stay open much longer than we historically have. So yes, we will look to extend the seasons in those markets for sure.
Brandon Ross: Great. And then Michael, I saw on your social that you invested in some new international venues. Can you maybe explain to us what your new venue strategy is going forward, what you're trying to accomplish in other parts of the world?
Michael Rapino : I always think we underestimate bragging about our venue portfolio. We are ready well over 200 venues that we operate somewhere in the world, amphitheaters, theaters, clubs, arenas in Dublin, Holland, etc. So, we know that the venue when we go vertical is a high-margin business for us. And I consider festivals almost venues, because you get to own the real estate for the weekend, you're owning all the revenue streams. So anytime that we can put a show in our festival or our venue on ticketed by Ticketmaster's, have our sponsorship able to use the asset and count all the revenue streams, it's our highest margin business.  What we've seen over time now is, in the last 5 years, is there has been a new real estate boom around the world where every major city in the world looks at live entertainment much like they used to look at movie theatres as being this incredible tenant in their development. So, we are talking ongoing to multiple developers around the world who are building something and they wanted 2,000-seat, a 5,000-seat, a 7,000-seat, maybe an arena than anchor into one of their developments.  So, we've really ramped up that division over the last 2 years and we see great opportunity around the world of continuing to expand our venue portfolio in these prime markets. I mean, Austin's an example where there's no arena. We're going to open that arena in the next couple of years. It's going to be a monster of a return for us as a great single venue in the Austin market right now, for live shows to complement our club, our theater, our amphitheater portfolio. So, we'll continue to be very opportunistic in the markets around the world where there's an opening for a live venue of any size.
Brandon Ross: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great, thank you. I appreciate all the detail you provided on the pricing and spending trends in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about how durable you think those trends will be into next year, especially now that you have the vantage point of seeing these trends play out across an entire summer conversely. And then, now that we're getting closer to 2022, and the slate's taking more shape, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cadence of shows that you expect in 2022 and how that might compare to a normal year? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold : Sure. This is Joe. I'll start on the pricing and the per-caps. I think we believe this is structurally a level of spend that we're seeing from the consumer now on the pricing, heavily driven by the front of the house, the best seats where we've long known there's this arbitrage because of the size and continued growth of the secondary market  even as we've been pricing and moving more money to the artists over the past several years. So, this year that trend continued. More VIP, more platinum tickets, getting that money to the artist. And we're seeing a relatively strong inelasticity on the demand for those best tickets.  And then on the onsite, I think because we're seeing it come from a number of fronts, we are confident that it's staying. So, we talked about it in the comments, right. Moving from cash to cashless just opens up increase spend. It's been a long existing difference between those 2 moving to a 100% cashless, just raises the average because instead of being half of each. And then we're seeing again structural trends people are going to a bit higher quality in terms of some of the alcohol, some of our product offerings are making more of a deal for people to take higher price point products.  All of those we think are a continuation of the trends that we've seen over the past several years and have no reason to expect that that would be any different going forward. In terms of the cadence for shows next year in general, and Michael talked about this a bit. You'll see similar where Q2 and Q3 will continue to be our strongest quarters. That's when we'll have a great stadium next year. It looks to be far and away the largest stadium we've ever -- we've had. That will be primarily in those Q2, Q3 outdoor months. Obviously, our amphitheaters and festivals, largely those months. And even the arena certainly here in the U.S. you just have more avails in those months because of the timing of the sport season. So, there's no reason not to expect similar seasonality in general as we've had historically.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen, please proceed with your question.
Stephen Glagola: Yes. Thank you. Joe on the ticketing segment that you had another great quarter, margins were at 46% on AOI. I know you said prior the Q2 is 40% margin shouldn't be extrapolated. And I know you love talking about margins, but I just wanted to see if you had an update on that mid-single-digit margin expansion that you talked about prior on annualized basis. Is that still how we should be thinking about the ticketing business coming out of the pandemic or are we talking about something higher than that now?
Joe Berchtold : Well, I think we absolutely believe you'll continue to expect to see higher than historical margins because of the cost reductions. This year you've -- this quarter you've got the particular benefit of a few things, one being that we ramped up our activity faster than we ramped up our staff. As we said, we were doing from our cost management so we pushed our people and extracted more from that side.  And secondly, as we also talked, this is much more of a U.S. driven, and then secondly UK driven, and we've talked historically about the fact that the U.S. market is a higher service fee and therefore generally a higher margin market than internationally. So, some of that mix shift will convert back next year. I don't think we're ready to give exact numbers, but we certainly do think that the ticketing margin will improve relative to historical.
Stephen Glagola: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Katz: Hi, evening everyone, and thanks for taking my question. With everything going as well as it has, and the numbers starting to materialize, I wanted to ask a little bit longer term, like 2023, And if there's any evidence to support the trajectory continuing to move up. In 2023, I think Joe, you may have used the phrase at one point, there's no air pocket out there. Any help there would be welcome.
Michael Rapino : Yes. I think to Joe's point, I think we've said it before. The good news is '22 is going to probably be a record year, but there's only so many Fridays and Saturdays and artists are pretty smart about how they route their tours and how they look at the world and find their right positioning. So, it’s kind of self-regulates itself. You're never going to have a bunch of tours on the same weekend piled on.  So that just meant we have a more inventory to spread into '22, '23, and we're talking '24 now. So, I would say we have a backlog that needs to still work through the system in '22, '23. which will be incredibly strong years. And then we continue to get back to regular -- we've had over the year, double-digit growth in the live entertainment space ongoing. We project that to continue both on pricing and global volume as demand and supply continues to grow around the world.
David Katz: Thank you for that. And if -- Michael, if I may just follow-up on the prospective deal front. I think when we last spoke, activity in terms of potential acquisitions were starting to ramp up again and become more active. Any update there that's worth sharing?
Michael Rapino : If you follow my Twitter, or what we're up to, we've been pretty active. We're back with our backlog of 30 to 40 things around the world. We're looking at that can keep propelling our business and growing our scale. So good pipe -- good pipeline will continue to be very aggressive at growing our global market share and then monetizing products on top of it.
David Katz: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Sundby with William Blair, please proceed with your question.
Ryan Sundby: Hey, Michael. Hi, Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. If you look at the 14 million net new fee-bearing customers that Ticketmaster’s added this year so far, what's been the primary drivers for growing that business? Are they looking for digital ticketing? Was there a change and particularly during COVID and then with 2/3 of them being international and finally, are these exclusive taking partners any color there would be great.
Joe Berchtold : Sure. as you said, 2/3 of them international, I think is indicative of particularly in the international markets. Just what a strong leadership position Ticketmaster has with a lot of the investments we've been making over the past 5 years. So digital ticketing, as you said, is -- overnight goes from being a nice feature to a critical part of it because you're moving away from contactless of any sort, you need a digital ticket, and our leadership there is a big differentiator, we've been investing for a long time, we're not trying to play catch-up. And these tickets are a mix of where we have the full allocation in some markets and other markets, we have a partial allocation. But in aggregate it's adding 14 million tickets to the portfolio.
Michael Rapino : William, I would just add I don't want to ever forget that Ticketmaster is incredibly great at what they do on a global basis. If you're -- if you own a stadium, an arena, high-volume ticket business with complex season owners and regular tickets -- it's a complex business to do at scale. So, a lot of our customers, sometimes we may lose a customer, they end up coming back.  So, one, I just want to remind you, we've been investing in this platform for the last few years. Our enterprise platform is a world-class platform. The U.S. ticket market is the most complicated market in the world. Reserved seats equal season seats are a complex model to manage the 10 AM on on-sale with box and all the things that pressure your system so when at the core enterprise platform is really good. So, we're more out competing for that offering. We end up just being ultimately winning the business because we are the best at it.  And we see that because we see the clients that may leave. But end up coming back because the functionality that we provide is superior to others. We're seeing this in a Brooklyn arena last week where the competitor was trying to do a presale that broke and that's a pretty basic stuff. So, I just remind people we are in a global basis, the best of what we do. That's why clients pick us. And then we happen to be global and opening up all of our technology to a global base is going to be our great runway for the next while.
Ryan Sundby: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And then just sequencing at this past quarter, it didn't sound like you called out a big impact from Delta here. Did you feel?  And did you see a rebound then I guess as you move, pass it further out?
Joe Berchtold : I think every month for us, we continue to see ongoing growth in the reopening, so it'd be hard to separate out Delta specifically versus reopening in general. But everything that we saw was more fans going to more shows consistently, contrary to some of the press I've seen very low no show rates, low to low single-digit increases in terms of no-shows as a result of the pandemic. So, it seems that the people that want to go to the shows are going to the shows. And that's just continue to grow as a portion of the fan base out there.
Ryan Sundby: That's good to hear. Thanks for the questions.
Michael Rapino : And to Joe's point, I would just add what you also noticed is the -- it's all different genres in ages. So, this isn't just young kids are going to shows because they're not scared but the Eagles just had a wildly successful on arena tour that's going to finish up this week in Seattle. The Grateful Dead route doing full stadiums. Harry Styles obviously doing indoors to just record business as well as our amphitheater business.  So, we did -- we weren't sure going into the market what segment or what age demo would react differently, or if there would be a difference, and we saw huge demand across the board at all ages, all demos, all markets. So strong rebound back as we've seen with the early on sales going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. My name is Hector, and I will be your conference operator on today's call. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Following management's prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. Instructions will be given at that time.

The release reconciliation and website supplement can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As communities reopened, we're seeing the pent-up demand for live events play out as artists and fans are eager to reconnect in-person. In the U.S. and U.K., we're seeing strong ticket sales and the restart of our concerts and festivals highlighted over the past weekend by Lollapalooza and Rolling Loud in the U.S. and Latitude in the U.K. hosting three-quarters of a million fans combined. With the vaccine rollouts increasing throughout Canada and Europe, we expect additional markets to open up broadly in the coming months. And momentum for the return of live has been building every month, with ticket sales and concert attendance pacing faster than expected, underscoring the strength and resilience, the Concert business, live events in general. This progress combined with our cost discipline has enabled us to deliver positive AOI for the second quarter, well ahead of where we thought we would be for this quarter. We expect to see for the ramp up accelerate to the rest of the year with all segments returning to AOI profitability for the second half of the year, then it's up for a full-scale 2022. As we put more shows on sale for this year and next, ticket sales are the best early indicator for concerts and our overall business. To that end, June was Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month in history for transacted ticket volume. This was driven in part by our U.S. Concert division, putting the highest number of shows on sale ever during a single month, 50% more than the next highest mark back in 2019. In Concerts, our or recovery this summer continue to be led by our outdoor events at our festivals and amphitheaters. We expect to have over 6 million fans attend our festivals during the second half of the year, with about two-thirds of our festivals increasing their attendance compared to 2019. Most of our major festivals sold out in record time, while average ticket prices have been 10% higher than 2019. And while still early at our amphitheater shows over the past few weeks, we have delivered strong double-digit increase in average per fan revenue and onsite spending versus 2019. Looking forward to 2022 and that 2023, all our leading indicators continue to point to a roaring era for concerts and other live events. Starting with our Concerts division, every major venue type arenas, amphitheaters, and stadiums, our pipeline indicating double-digit growth in our show count and ticket sales relative to 2019 levels. In some cases, our pipeline is so strong, we are extending our planning into 2023 and even beginning to discuss tours that extended to 2024.  The same time, Ticketmaster's leading edge technology continues to attract new clients, adding 11 million net new feed bearing tickets so far this year, already surpassing any previous full year growth. As a result, Ticketmaster is set to benefit in 2022 from both increased Live Nation concert ticket sales, as well as additional sales from new clients. In our Sponsorship business, our brand partners have maintained and grown their interest in live events, with contracts and sponsorship up double-digits for 2022, where we were at this point in 2019 for 2020. As our revenue is rebounding, we continue to evolve our business to maximize opportunities and the global recovery and strengthen our flywheel. We have structurally reduced our cost basis by $200 million, making us more nimble and converting more of our revenue AOI. We have integrated our Ticketmaster team globally, enabling us to work toward a global product roadmap that will both reduce our costs and increase our flexibility and speed to deploy new client tools and approve our marketplace experience. And we continue to build our direct to consumer business initiatives ranging from streaming concerts NFTs to artists merchandise, bringing more value to artists and deepening fan relationships. These enhancements combined with our strongest supply and demand dynamics our industry has ever seen are fueling our core flywheel strategy and setting us up for multiple years of growth, attendance revenue, and AOI. And with that, I'll let Joe take you through more details of our results.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've done over the past year, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. In the second quarter, our AOI was positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic, as the U.S. by far our largest market, accelerated its reopening also driving our revenue to the highest level since the first quarter of last year. As a result, our contribution margin ramped up faster than expected, particularly in ticketing. Even with the increased activity, our monthly gross burn for the first half of the year was lower than the monthly burn during the last three quarters of 2020 due to our structural cost savings and continued cost discipline. As a result, we remain confident that actions taken to reduce cash burn and increased liquidity will provide us with the runway we need as shows return. And as we move toward reopening in more markets, we continue to balance the strong cost and cash management with making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect to generate positive AOI overall, and for each segment for the second half of the year, we will also reduce costs this year by over $800 million and reduce cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans. Looking at our Q2 results. Revenue for the quarter was $576 million compared to $74 million in the second quarter of 2020 for growth of over $0.5 billion. All three of our business segments more than doubled their revenues from last year. Our AOI for the quarter was $10 million compared to a loss of $432 million for the second quarter of 2020. Our Q2, 2021 AOI consisted of $351 million of contribution margin, which included $364 million from operations, along with various one-time items, including gains from insurance recoveries and government support and losses from ticketing service fee refunds paid out. This was then offset by $341 million in operational fixed costs. Getting into our business segments a bit deeper, starting with ticketing, which was the primary driver of our results this quarter, contribution margin for the quarter was $204 million or nearly 60% of our total contribution margin delivering $99 million in AOI. Ticketing revenue for the quarter was $244 million or just over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter. Each month of a quarter, Ticketmaster had progressively stronger results, culminating with June being Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month ever for transacted ticket volume. In general, North America drove much of this resurgence, accounting for over 75% of total transacted tickets in the quarter as compared to approximately two-thirds of transacted tickets for 2019. Contract tickets drove much of this activity, and as a result, the top 10 artists sold over $513 million in GTV during second quarter this year compared to $329 million in the second quarter of 2019. Secondary ticketing has similarly rebounded. Our June GTV was only 8% below June of 2019. That trend has continued into the third quarter, with July 12th marking the highest resale GTV day in our history, driven by the U.S. Open along with strong NBA, NFL, and concert presale volumes. These results in ticketing are a leading indicator to our concerts business. For the second quarter, our concerts AOI loss of $84 million was an improvement of $127 million relative to Q2 last year, and our revenue was up $145 million relative to Q2 last year, as we promoted nearly 1,700 shows for 1.3 million fans during the quarter. More importantly, these tickets sales drove our event-related deferred revenue up to $2.1 billion, representing a pipeline of future activity, even higher than the $1.6 billion we had at the end of the second quarter in 2019. In part, this event-related deferred revenue is associated with over 25 million tickets we have sold for our concerts in the second half of this year, along with also being part of the 14 million tickets that we have already sold for concerts in 2022, which reflects strong double-digit growth in our 2022 pipeline for show count and fans relative to 2019. Sponsorship and advertising then naturally flow from our ticketing and concert platforms. Our sponsorship and advertising AOI for the quarter was $13 million and revenue was $45 million, with the bulk of our activity tied to our ticketing platform and concert presales. We continue to find brands are committed to maintaining or increasing their span with Live Nation to reach our music fans and other live event audiences. And during the quarter we added several long-term strategic partners, including Allegiant Air, Adobe and Cinch in the airline technology and auto sectors, respectively. And more broadly, we expect our sponsorship and advertising full-scale activity to return somewhere between ticketing and concerts timing. Most importantly, as we look out at our 2022 pipeline, confirmed activity is pacing well ahead of where we were in 2019 at this point. And with many multiyear contracts on the books, we are lining up to be growing this business in 2022 and beyond. Looking at free cash and liquidity. As of June 30th, we had total cash of $4 billion, including $1.1 billion in ticketing client cash and $1.8 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving free cash of $1.1 billion. This was flat relative to our first quarter reported number. Our free cash, along with $971 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020, and steady with our Q1 ending liquidity. Benefiting our free cash position, the second quarter was $161 million in favorable timing, largely the result of classification of our event-related deferred revenue between short-term and long-term. Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $163 million or $54 million per month, which included $115 million per month of operational burn up from $100 million per month in the first quarter, as furloughed employees returned to prepare for our reopening and we reinstated full pay for most employees, plus another $58 million per month of non-operational costs, including investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions and artists and ticket client advances to give us $173 million average per month in gross burn. In Q2, we had $119 million average per month cash contribution margin, double our Q1 average. Turning to other balance sheet items, more on deferred revenue. At the end of the second quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that we'll play in the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Ticket sales in the second quarter were nearly $900 million, while refunds totaled $100 million and shifted deferred revenue from short-term to long-term for shows that were rescheduled into the back half of 2022, totaled $150 million. This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to short-term during Q3 and Q4 reversing the timing benefit and free cash this quarter. Our total capital expenditures were $52 million for the first six months, with $38 million spent on revenue generating items. The markets have reopened faster than expected. We will similarly be accelerating some of our investments to take advantage of additional opportunities this year and into 2020. As a result, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $170 million, with over 60% of this spend going into revenue generating CapEx projects. Our total debt as of June 30th was $5.3 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%, with about 90% of that debt at a fixed rate. Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale further in the second half of this year in key markets, notably outdoor, and led by the U.S. and U.K. With this activity, we will continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its on sale, the concerts division to book end market 2022 tours and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands onsite and online. Given the COVID issues in our key markets appear to be short-term at this point, we continue to expect 2022 activity and results to exceed 2019 levels with continued growth opportunities from there. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. Just with COVID kind of being what it is at the moment, the Delta variant, can you just maybe talk through how you're thinking about navigating some of the challenges that might come up in the next a month or two, like changing health mandates, shifts in demand, any hesitation or concerns on the part of the artist?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. David, this is Joe. I think what we're seeing is a shift to increasing requirements for entry of either vaccinated or tested or fully vaccinated. We had Lollapalooza over the last weekend, very successfully done, over 90% of the people were fully vaccinated, which I think was a great signal in terms of people's commitment and support of being vaccinated in order to go to these shows. So, my expectation is that we will see that continue, whether at the artist's level, at the city level, like New York just announced or large crowds, frankly Lollapalooza certainly went above and beyond what was happening at baseball games in Chicago. And similarly, I think, in other markets we're going above what others are doing. So, we'll continue to focus on that. I think the great news is that at this point, the discussion is around what are the requirements to hold the events? What do we need to see in terms of vaccinations and testing? Not hearing discussions, certainly in the U.S. or the U.K. about impacting those shows to any scale.
David Karnovsky: Got it. And I know you just restarted the amp and the festivals, but any early insights in the fan behavior so far. You mentioned per caps are up at the amp, is there any additional color you can provide what's driving that. And then, maybe with digital ticketing, any learnings from having that tech kind of rolled out at scale across your own music venue footprint? Thanks. 
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. At this point, we've probably done about 50 amp shows that we've gotten the data on in time for today's call. And as we said, all of that looks to be continuing to trend up. People are buying more food and beverage. We're selling more VIP packages, more upsells. So, in general, the pocket books are open. I think it's pretty mature to get any real specific inferences. And I think it's also just -- it's a little bit early to get the specific impact of digital ticketing. We believe that eliminating friction always helps commerce, but we probably won't have the data on that till our next call.
David Karnovsky: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Laszczyk: Hey, great. Thank you. On the 2022 concert pipeline being up double-digits versus 2019, I was wondering if you could give us a sentence on how much of the pipeline is for sale today or sold today versus how much is still to come. And then, as you maybe look out over the next few quarters, how much headroom do you think is left to grow the concert slate in 2022, given some of the scheduling and health constraints you're working with, any commentary, there would be helpful.
Joe Berchtold: Sure. We are -- go ahead.
Michael Rapino: So, I'll start Joe, and then you jump. Most of our 2022 new tours wouldn't be on sale yet. Most of -- what you see on sale is what would have been rescheduled from 2021 are already on sale. So, we have a large on-sell slate plan between now and end of the year for most of the big global tours that will go out in 2022. And we're not -- we're very content with our 2022 lineup right now. We're talking mostly about what to add now into 2023 and 2024. So that idea that -- it's just one year of -- our bigness isn't really true. We've got three, four years here of strong demand that we're going to smooth out over the time, so everyone can get the right markets and the right Friday nights and the right dates. So, we see a good few year run with all this pent-up inventory.
Stephen Laszczyk: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, on the Ticketmaster side, and you mentioned you had an 11 million net new fee bearing tickets year-to-date. I think I was up from around 5 million last quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about who you're winning this ticket business from. Is this a certain types of venues, league teams, maybe some of the things that's resonating with your pitch with these potential ticketing partners. Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. It's really happening on a global basis. We're seeing it in the U.S. We're seeing in Europe. We're seeing it in Asia. We put out various releases in terms of -- as we've been picking up some clients, but I wouldn't say that there's one market or one type of client in particular. It's pretty broad. I do think what's resonating is we've been very loud in terms of artist clearing the extent to which we're continuing to invest in ticketing, in the shift to digital ticketing and the benefit that that's going to be giving to the teams, the venues and the customers. And that seems to be working with the clients we're talking to.
Stephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
John Janedis: Thanks. I just had two questions. One was, with the expectations for the touring supercycle over the next, call it, two to three years. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the demand side in terms of fans and do you assume sale ups for the cycle are at pre-pandemic levels or maybe higher or lower? And then, on the ticketing margin side, there was -- a lift there. Is that a chunk of the $200 million in cost savings is kicking in and there's something close to that level of new normal, or are there any items to call out?
Michael Rapino: I'll do demand side. I think we -- from the data we're seeing so far, everything we seem to be putting on sale is doing better than pre-pandemic. So, demand seems to be pent-up most of what we see going up for 2022 is great quality, tourists and artists. So, we would expect, as we've seen over the last 10 years, demand, overall for live on a global basis, has continually been growing.  We like to always point out, we think that the product is still under priced, given all of the secondary business. So, this is still an attractive night out for a fan. And now that artists traveling more around the world, the fan base has grown for live as a functional -- entertainment item. So, we think global demand will continue, have double-digit growth as an industry for many years to come as the global landscape continues to grow.
Joe Berchtold: And then, John, on the TM margin, I mean, clearly, I spoke in my comments that we're looking this year, that we're going to be reducing our total cost structure by about $800 million relative to where we were pre-pandemic. And the $200 million structural savings is a subset of that. So, what we're navigating this year is the pace at which we bring back some of the costs versus the pace at which we ramp up activity. And it's not going to be totally linear. We had a great month of June in TM, and we're finally getting back to scale there and we expect to have nice scale with Ticketmaster in the second half, but the first part of the year was lower scale. So, overall, yeah, we expect margins to improve, because a large chunk of that $200 million is going to come out of Ticketmaster and that would just naturally flow into a margin. I wouldn't try to overly analyze the single quarter and let's get you a few more quarters at more traditional scale, with more traditional costs and staffing over the next six months.
John Janedis: That’s helpful. Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Brandon Ross: Thanks. A couple of questions ago, the conversation centered around ticketing wins and press releases for you guys. And I thought one of the more interesting developments in the quarter was the extension and expansion of your relationship with ASM. For two reasons, one is that ASM's, obviously half AEG and it didn't go to access. But more so that Ticketmaster could sell tickets for Live Nation promoted shows in the other ASM venues. And the North American ticket model's been exclusive for -- as long as I can remember, at least. Is this a sign of change in the future? Do you think that exclusivity model is here to stay, or do you think depending on event type, the promoter will ultimately control the ticket?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. I think the exclusive approach has worked well for the venues and the ecosystem is a large part of how the venues get funded and how the venues then make the rental costs approachable for promoters and artists. So, it's an ecosystem that's worked well in the U.S. and the Ticketmaster, as you know, has been a very large source of funding and the profit stream for the venues. I wouldn't read too much into this. If you look at ASM scale, that's not a common, typical scale in terms of the number of buildings they have. It's also a fairly unique situation where you have somebody who owns buildings. Who's saying, we're going to let you bring in Ticketmaster regardless of the situation. And they control both sides of that decision-making. It's not something that we are looking to do or that we see as any real mark of the industry going forward.
Michael Rapino: What I would add, Brandon, I think the most -- Brandon, I wouldn't say the most important thing you said is what you lead with is the fact that ASM owned by AEG and a private equity fund, the largest venue management company, obviously did their homework and debated their own ticket options and renewed with Ticketmaster, because we ultimately provide the best global solution in ticketing for them. I assume they would have liked to have used their own in-house ticketing system. But I think our relationship and what we've done for all those venues for so long, won us that business, the met renewal. So that was a very important renewal, a very good testament to Ticketmaster. I give the ASM management team credit, they put their bias aside and what was the best option in the marketplace after looking at all options. So, we are very proud that that's a very good testament to the Ticketmaster core competency. You hit that part for sure.
Brandon Ross: Cool. Thanks.
Michael Rapino: And you can update your Twitter now that we've talked about COVID and Delta. We assumed it would -- what happened on this call.
Brandon Ross: Great.
Operator: Your next question comes from …
Joe Berchtold: Sorry. We missed that. Is there a question? Operator? Operator?
Operator: I apologize. Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ben Swinburne: Hi. Can you hear me?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. Ben, big build up.
Ben Swinburne: Yeah. Better not follow it. A couple of questions. So, you ended your prepared remarks, I think by saying you continue to expect 2022 activity levels to exceed 2019. And I apologize if that's a reiteration of prior guidance that I might've missed. But just wanted to ask you what you meant by that. Is that a comment about revenue and AOI? I know where -- the street expectations are, but I thought I'd give you a chance to maybe expand on that. And then, the second question is just, you made a helpful comment around sponsorship saying that I think contracted business is up double-digits for 2022 relative to where you were in 2019 for 2020. I guess similar question, the ticketing question, how much of the forward year is sort of already in the books typically to understand what that tells us about next year and make sure we don't over extrapolate that comment about growth for a sponsorship. Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. Just in terms of overall 2022 expectations. First, it starts for us with what are the concert bookings. What are the show count look like? And from that, our expectations on the ticket counts, both of which we think, again, are up relative to 2019 based on what we said. And I think as we've gone through the past three months, whatever we said three months ago, we're more confident in that at this point. And as a result, we expect then revenue and AOI growth relative to 2019 as well to be and sponsorship, then we'll be a part of that expectation, up double-digits and committed sponsorship. Usually you'd have -- I mean, we've talked about how much of our sponsorship is in the form of multiyear, multi-million dollar, multi-asset strategic sponsors. That's a large portion of our sponsorship base. So, last -- we probably wouldn't be talking about expectations of growth for next year already at this point, unless we had a pretty good feel that a lot of it was committed. 
Ben Swinburne: Sure. Makes sense. Great. Thank you very much.
Joe Berchtold: Operator? Operator, do we have any other questions? David Katz, if you're on the line, can you go ahead and ask your question? I think you're next to the queue. Can you hear us?
Operator: Yes. I apologize. Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Katz: Okay. If you can all hear me okay.
Joe Berchtold: Yep. No problem.
David Katz: Appreciate you taking my question. Appreciate all the detail. What I wanted to ask about since it is prevalent in a lot of other areas of our coverage is, the issue of human resources and labor, where we have seen a lot of constraints around, frankly getting people to come back to work. You made a comment about it in your prepared remarks, bringing people back at full salaries and so forth. Is that a matter that you have had to deal with work around, strategize around and how do you see it?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. Start with, as you know, unfortunately we had to furlough a reasonable number of people over the course of the last year. At this point, we've brought back over 90% of our furloughed staff, of those we've called back over 90% have returned furlough. We had a fairly low turnover rate and we think turnover rate at, or below the overall entertainment industry. So, we feel very good about how we've been able to retain staff. I think it's a testimony to people's commitment to our industry and the culture that we've built here. So, in terms of the core people that are the ones that we've talked about, bringing back the shows, bringing back the ticketing and the sponsorship, those people are in place. As we've put on our shows in various amphitheaters and festivals sites around the country and around the world, we've been able to get the volume of people we needed. It hasn't been a material cost impact, taking in total. And we've had to work a bit harder at times to find the people, but it has not impacted our ability to put on the shows.
David Katz: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Michael Rapino: And I would add to that. I think the only piece that we're working through right now is the -- all the part-time employees that are on the front of the line at the amphitheater, at the festival, we're going to be rolling out soon our kind of mandated vaccine for our employees. We're going to move forward and be very progressive on ensuring all our employees are vaccinated. And we're going to move lower with artists and managers, where we're seeing there -- the likes of these artists that are going to want fully vaccinated and tested shows as ways to continue to keep the show moving forward. So, I think that the biggest challenge we've had is just scrambling on a day-to-day basis with part-time employees back, and abiding by different local COVID laws, mask, no mask, now test no test. I think that's been our only real challenge from an HR and communication. So, hats off to my frontline. They're doing an incredible job, running, hard, trying to adjust, and we're going to move to more central protocols now on mandating the backseat and helping them out, make sure they're all safe, too.
David Katz: Super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve …
Joe Berchtold: We are back here, operator. We missed the name.
Michael Rapino: Well, we can put a concert on, but on a conference call.
Operator: Steve Glagola, your line is now live.
Michael Rapino: Steve?
Joe Berchtold: Hey, Steve. Go ahead.
Stephen Glagola: Hi, guys. Thank you. Well, you still have the best earnings call music. So, if that means anything. I'd say -- I just had a question on, can you discuss how much the ticketing GTV was tied to sports versus concerts in the quarter, and how you see that mix over the second half of the year?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. Those were certainly the two largest components, concerts and sports. And we'll again in the second half as we relaunch -- second half relaunch, NBA, NHL, NFL, all of those at scale. So you'll have a big full season of the three major sports. And at the same time, you're going to have a massive on sale for 2022. I wouldn't try to parse exactly which one's bigger than the other in a given month, but those two will be the two key drivers as they were in the past few months.
Stephen Glagola: Okay. Thanks, Joe. And I don't know if you've already said this, so I apologize. But on the guidance for AOI profitability across every segment in the second half, is that for each quarter or is that just the sum of Q3 and Q4?
Joe Berchtold: We just -- our comment was for the sum of Q3 and Q4 that each segment, we expect to be AOI positive.
Stephen Glagola: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to close the call out. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. My name is Hector, and I will be your conference operator on today's call. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Following management's prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. Instructions will be given at that time. Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the Company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the Company's most recent filings on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. When we spoke last in February, I was optimistic that we will soon be returning to live events, and since then, our confidence has increased for our key markets. In the US, over 40% of the population received at least one vaccine dose, and most states are now fully or partially reopening with more restrictions being lifted daily. In the UK, over 50% of the population has received at least one vaccine dose and their reopening roadmap is tracking to plan. And although Europe remains a few months behind on vaccinations, they are progressing and recent discussions about reopening to international visitors this summer are encouraging. Around the world, people are showing the need to get out and socialize once again, which reinforces our expectation that a return to concerts will be the logical progression as vaccines are readily available to everyone who wants one. This is generally already in the case in the US, where we are confidently planning our reopenings, particularly front door shows, and we expect other major markets will follow this summer. Alongside these trends, we are seeing the effects of significant pent-up demand as fans are buying tickets and events are selling out faster than ever. In the US, Bonnaroo, Electric Daisy and Rolling Loud festivals all sold out in record times at full capacity. In the UK, we have 11 festivals planned this summer, including our largest ones Reading, Leeds and Parklife where tickets are already sold out. New Zealand, the country's largest festival, Rhythm and Vines quickly sold out. And as we get further clarity on reopening timelines, we are announcing more tours for late this summer, including Dave Matthews, Luke Bryan, Maroon 5 and others to come, showing artists' increasing confidence in performing this summer.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we have done over the past few quarters, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release, to reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. For the first quarter, all the key cost and cash numbers improved relative to Q4 2020 and are at or better than what we expected at the start of the quarter. We remain confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increased liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until we bring shows back, which will begin to scale in key markets outdoor this summer. As we move toward reopening, we continue to balance strong cost and cash management. We are now making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect the second quarter to be our first year-on-year improvement since Q4 of 2019, and to also be generating positive AOI through the second half of the year, we still plan on reducing costs this year by $750 million and reducing cash spend by $1.5 billion, relative to pre-pandemic plans.
Michael Rapino: Before taking questions, I wanted to cover one other thing. Kathy Willard, our CFO for the past 15 years will be retiring as of June 30. She will be than staying on as an advisor throughout the end of the year. As of July 1, the plan is for Joe Berchtold to become CFO. Kathy as you know has been an invaluable part of our executive team for the past 15 years and been with Live Nation for over 20. We are a much stronger company because of her, not just from her role as CFO, but as a champion for women at the company and the industry, an important adviser to me on a range of issues. Because she built such an effective finance organization, I'm confident we will remain in good shape as Joe steps in. He and Kathy have been working together closely for over a decade now and he has gotten more deeply involved over the past year, as we have been planning this transition. In addition, late last year we elevated Jackie Beato, EVP of Operations to take on greater responsibility and give Joe the bandwidth he will need for the job. More than anything, I want to thank Kathy for her impact on the Company, her commitment and her friendship. Operator, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Karnovsky: I'm going to a question.  And Kathy, if you're on the call, good luck and you'll will be missed. And I guess with regards to the summer, early fall, Michael or Joe, can you provide a sense for how much is booked at this point relative to a normal year in the US or UK? And just given the lead time, how much room do you have still kind of ramp that higher shoot conditions improve further from here?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. This is Joe. David, I'd say that the summer and early fall, next three to four months is largely booked. We obviously have a lot that is shifted from last year into this year. We've added some tours so we've also added a number of festivals, all of which have been selling well. So the typical ramp show is probably a couple of months' lead time, so I think we'll still have room to be adding more as we get into August and September, but the majority has been booked at this point.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And then, can you maybe just expand a bit on the reviews following landscape over the next 12 to 18 months given all the supply that's built on? How do you expect to kind of efficiently allocated out all the tours? Are there any capacity constraints, not necessarily in terms of venues, but just in terms of maybe like the weekend nights that are available?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. We're currently in that good position. We have lots of great conversations with probably every artist you can imagine, talking about when they're going to be back on the road. And artist typically tours once every three years on a cycle, so we're kind of condensing 2021 and '22. So the good news is we've got incredible supply and now we're just sorting through what makes sense to go out in '20 -- at the end of '21 still -- into '22, and some artists were talking about moving into '23. So I would say, the artists are patient and they're smart in terms of what their cycle is predicting, maybe they have a record coming out in the fall, maybe it's in Q1. So right now, we have a great supply. We don't have any issues in terms of availability. But we're also not looking to cram everything in three years into one year. We're looking to stage a good '22 into '23 year. So when you spread it over those two years, you find enough Fridays and enough weekends and enough routing challenges come to be solved that way.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in. I guess this Concerts activity is now ramping up, can you maybe just discuss a little bit about what the process has been for Live Nation? What are you finding you can do it differently versus prior to the pandemic? And maybe just what your overall confidence level is in hitting your prior target for structural cost savings? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. We're very confident we're going to hit the structural $200 million cost savings we given you. As we've talked about, we've done it the opposite way, which is we took $950 million of cost out, and so now it's a matter of how we let $750 million of costs back in over a period of time. So that gives us -- that makes it more real if you will. We've done a number of things. On the Ticketing side, we've talked about, we've shifted that to a truly global organization as part of moving into a true single approach on the marketplace, on the enterprise and on all the technology. On the Concert side, we have a longstanding local network, which is very important to continue to understand the markets. So the 80% of your shows now booked to be tours, you don't need to have an entire infrastructure in every local market. So we've been seeing that there are ways of streamlining it and when we were growing double-digits every year through most of the last decade, it wasn't worth the potential disruption. But as we've stopped, we've asked ourselves, what's the best way to do this rebuilding from the ground up. And we're very confident, it's going to deliver those savings and be an even more effective organization for driving future growth.
David Karnovsky: Thank you.
Michael Rapino: And just to add to Joe, I think there's two ways to look at the business. We got -- we had a great workout, testing a new muscle for the last 12 months in terms of our balance sheet, our fixed costs and how we can become more efficient. And I think that you're going to see come to life through our $200 million-plus. But I think the real win of the downtime was what is the new products of the kind of Live Nation 3.0? What else are we going to do with this incredible scale we have across our consumer base? So I would say whether it's Sponsorship, Concerts or Ticketmaster, we would have a new level of new products in the pipe that we had not historically had the time, nor the skill set to kind of unlock. So I'm very confident over the next couple of years, we're going to see some exciting new things coming out of the Concert division. Our consumer side of the business -- our Subscription business, our Ticketmaster business, our new Ad business models we're looking at. So a bunch of exciting ideas now finally had months and months to put some people around and skill set that we've acquired to advance that part of our business. So, we look at the future is not only can we run the largest concert company in the world more efficiently and the best at it, but also what other new products will drive our business to think differently about the customer and the artist.
David Karnovsky: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Brandon Ross: Hello. Just -- I guess you just mentioned Live Nation 3.0, so figured I take it web 3.0. And you earlier mentioned the digital ticket and the ability to now integrates blockchain. I was wondering if you could help us understand what the extra advantages are to utilizing the blockchain versus your current version of the digital ticket? And maybe how heavy of a lift that is for you and what tactic plan to use?
Michael Rapino: Thanks, Brandon. It's a great question. We got asked it every day and I read a new article every day on all the great things it's going to solve. So let's step back in blockchain, we think it's a very exciting technology. We're currently using blockchain technology in our products. We've invested in this business for a few years now and we think it's a great technology that will help our business. I would step back from what are the problems that we're trying to solve or what are the opportunities that blockchain specifically brings to the Ticketing business. One of the great advantages in the industry is when we went from a TDF to a digital ticket, we unlocked a lot of what you keep reading about the blockchain is going to do in the future. So the digital ticket or your mobile ticket that you are now buying has solved the biggest problem that unlocked we've been talking about this for two years Identity. Identity for us, the fan, the artist, the team and the venue knowing who sits on that seat, who is actually coming to the venue, having a communication directly with them, having a verified ticket, being able to trade that ticket, putting rules on that ticket. We currently do that now. If you want to, can you transfer it with a certain cap, all of those things that content could decide to do if they wanted to with the digital ticket. And the service fee, I read about being reduced. I mean the service fee could be reduced tomorrow. It's just a function of the venue, not the ticket company. So digital ticket and moving from the old TDF model that historically around the industry has been achieved to date, we've been talking the last couple of years about the progression of adoption. COVID obviously has really sped that up. Most tickets access now does not want to be in the contact business, so having a ticket on your mobile phone, walking into that venue and then being able to buy a drink, communicate with each other, upsell, you name the ideas when you have a direct communication with your fan, those are all being unlocked right now by sports teams, by venues and artists. So we think the blockchain technology is a great part of a technology solution to keep providing a better communication and identity platform for the fan. But that's already in place. There is nothing blockchain would bring to that that we can't or others currently achieved. So we'll continue to lose blockchain to supplement and augment our platform, and continue to look to be better at it. And we think it's a great opportunity in ticketing, just getting this full access. I would step back and Brandon, you and I've talked about this before in terms of what does the ticket company do? I mean, quite honestly, selling the ticket is the easiest part of being a ticketing company. When we talk to clients, they don't pick us because we can sell a ticket. They pick us because we have market -- marketing and distribution reach. They pick us because we have one of the largest marketplaces in the world to help them sell tickets. They pick us because we have a secured great technology platform they can plug-and-play with their APIs and their databases and their consumer needs. And they also pick us because it's a financing mechanism. A ticketing business is about financing the venues and exchanging that for ticketing rights. So it's a full bundle to be a ticketing company, and that's what Ticketmaster has delivered so successfully for so many years. And we'll continue to think lead with blockchain and bringing identity and all of the transparency and benefit but now having that ticket with an ownership to market.
Brandon Ross: And can you maybe talk a little bit about -- hello?
Michael Rapino: Yes.
Brandon Ross: Can you maybe talk a little bit about the collectibles' angle to it?
Michael Rapino: Right.
Brandon Ross: Obviously, NFTs are very popular right now. How does that integrate into your ticketing system? Or is that something that would be separate from Ticketmaster?
Michael Rapino: Right. No. That's -- and we think that's the great opportunity. NFTs are just another way of saying, can I add value to the customer relationship? Can I put a contract or privileges on that ticket for the customer? And that's a great mechanism and it's a great vehicle. I mean, whether we sell a T-shirt to that customer coming into a concert or we sell them a PDF with a unique piece of artwork or concert moment, it's another mechanism to engage your customer, find unique products that will let those magic memories of that event live on. So, macro level, we're always in the business of figuring out what else can we add to that experience that the customer would engage in to cement that magic moment called the concert. So NFTs specifically, on the Ticketmaster side, they're working already with sports teams and festivals and everyone else about how they would -- how they can layer an NFT on a ticket. You can mint a ticket and mint an NFT right on top of a Ticketmaster platform and deliver it how you want. So that's -- Ticketmaster will be in the delivery business using their ticket -- digital ticket, blockchain. And then as the customer creates its own NFT, we can sell those and bridge those together on whatever minting system and/or marketplace they use. On the Live Nation side, we're deep in exploration. We have a great team that's been working on this and working with the Mark Cubans of the world and others who are smart in this space. And I think you'll see us come out with an interesting Live Nation concert NFT angle. We think it's a great way for us to engage with our fans using that NFT and that direct relationship now to add rewards, add perks, add souvenir moments. We've all learned from top shops at the NBA, so we envision Live Nation with the marketplace and looking at some of its concert moments as magic moments that we could mint and attach to our ongoing ticket festivals and special moments. So we think it's -- if you have IP, we think it's an exciting time to use that IP to create some exciting moments with fans that can trade it ongoing and live that moment and kind of cement that relationship they have with that. July 16, the first concert back at Jones Beach, and I got an NFT and a special souvenir ticket that's mine forever. I can trade it. I can put it in my wallet and own that moment forever. So we think it's a fabulous moment to take a boring PDF and turn it into a magic souvenir with unlimited ideas on how you can bring that to life for the fan. So we think it's an exciting time. We think we'll be able to use our scalable IP to launch our own ways to engage with the fan in this space, as well as empowering our artists through our management company that we've been doing to date.
Brandon Ross: Makes sense. And then, I guess while we're on ticketing, just one last one. With the Vivid back, thought maybe it would be a good time to get some updated -- your updated thoughts on the secondary ticketing market. Do you see that as a growth market, I guess, as an industry, first of all, and then for Ticketmaster, secondly? And kind of maybe how you see the competitive landscape in that arena now?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. We absolutely believe in the secondary market. It's another set of distribution platforms of getting tickets in the hands of fans. For all the reasons Michael talked about in terms of digital ticketing and identity, we think that more and more of the control over secondary will go to content. The sports teams and the artists, as they have a wide set of agendas in terms of what they'd like to accomplish and how they'd like to have their relationship with their fans. So we think it -- we think there's some evolution as it goes to digital ticketing, and we absolutely support the content having more control over how that happens. We support there being more transparency in secondary. But we think it's here to stay, and it will continue to be an important distribution platform. We'll continue to focus on pricing to get as much of the value of those tickets in the hands of fans as we can. And I think as we look at Vivid, they've all got a similar business model, right, so all a service fee business model. They've got customer acquisition costs associated with a lot of search in digital, and we have more customer acquisition costs associated with alignment with content. But it's similar at the end of the day business model. We think we've got a great proposition by aligning with content and by also leveraging the scale of our Ticketmaster platform. So we like the position we're in, whether it grows or shrinks exactly as artists price their content to market value is less of a concern and making sure we're delivering on that content agenda.
Brandon Ross: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Ben Swinburne: Thank you. Michael, you kind of freaked me out with that July 2021 because I have a ticket to the Black Rose at Jones Beach on that day. So maybe you're going to be there as well, probably in better seats. I guess just picking up quickly on the secondary conversation with Brandon. Any comments or reaction to the noise out of DC on safe tickets and what's going on? I thought it was -- first I thought it was sort of unusual to be bringing up and defending sort of the secondary market in that context. But I didn't know -- you know, we sort of put the consent decree behind us, I thought. I don't know if you had any comment on that stuff since it came out over the last month or so?
Michael Rapino: Yes. It would surprise us, too, that right now where we are. But (inaudible) has been on this mission for quite a while, so we would love to sit with his team and educate him on the business so we can get all of the idiosyncrasies nailed because it's never as simple as it seems. So I really -- we look at that as a bit of a nuance.  They seem to be obviously, scalpers are doing a good job of convincing his staff that we are going to do a digital ticket in a closed platform. So that's their great fear that we're going to have a digital ticket, and we're going to tell you when you buy that ticket, you can only resell it at Ticketmaster. That's never been our intent. So their -- kind of their main claim (inaudible) if they would sit down with us, we'd explain it's never been our intent to have a closed platform. We've actually -- the biggest thing I've done at Ticketmaster since taken over is rebuild this Company so we can have an open platform. Our goal is to sell that first ticket. But as we did with the NFL last year, we have an open platform with the NFL. We power the NFL. And if those secondary companies are approved by the NFL, then that ticket you buy for the NFL can be freely sold on any other platform and used to get in the show. So that's -- we think it's the best model. We think we have the largest kind of footprint from a primary platform. We believe that if the ticket is to be resold, we have a great marketplace for that, for the Ticketmaster fan. But we're also working and have been working towards an open platform that it can be sold in other places if the content like the NFL or venues want that path forward. So not sure there's much meat to the claim. We're not looking to limit distribution. We're looking to increase distribution for the teams, venues and artists. And the best platforms will win in the end that offer the best value to the content and the fan. So that's our plan. We think we have an incredible opportunity in ticketing in that. The amount of people that buy at Ticketmaster and actually resell their ticket is very, very low, so we think we have a natural huge audience that we should do a better job of allowing you, the fan, if you just bought to think about how you can resell on our platform, and maybe there's better incentives we can do for you as a fan to make that even more seamless. But if you want to sell on other platforms as we do on the NFL, then we'll be happy to validate that ticket and let the content decide where it's sold.
Ben Swinburne: That's very helpful. Second, just on Veeps, I think you guys announced 60 venues have been equipped with their technology. Just any updated thoughts on how substantial that opportunity is as you guys look into reopening later this year and into next year from a business point of view -- a business model point of view?
Michael Rapino: Well, I think it's, you know, no different than we just talked about NFTs, right? Our job is to keep looking at our core business and making sure we can add more exciting products around that core business. We're just thrilled with the acquisition partnership with the Madden Brothers, who run this on a daily basis. It's their -- soul and sweat they put in, it's really all them. We've just added a bit of a firehose by helping them with our distribution. I think they're up to over 1,000 shows in the last year, probably grow somewhere over 10 million, so a good start to that business. But now you're going to see with our new clubs, we do 10,000 club shows. So you start digging into that a little bit, adding some amphitheaters, and the part we think is really exciting is our festivals. Opening up that model that in Lollapalooza instead of just rebroadcasting that for free. What if for $49, you could watch the Lollapalooza weekend, or you could buy the Lollapalooza day at home and continue your party at home if you couldn't make it to the venue. So we've seen great success in our EDM business. (inaudible) blown the numbers up on his business when he does that. So we think extending the festival, which is a bit of a party at home model, it's got a great opportunity. And I would much rather use my festivals to add another revenue ticket to the equation than treat it as promotion value. So we're going to test that this summer, and we think we'll get some learning, and that'll help us move forward in that place. If you just launch festival TV, you have a proposition itself there with our 150-plus festivals. So we think that's exciting plus our club business for young artists. So new space for us. We think it's an exciting place to add value. We think there is subscription ideas forward with that and we think we can bundle it with other things. We think there is a great foundation to our core business here that we can keep exploring and innovating on.
Ben Swinburne: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Glagola: Hi. Thanks for the question. The July through November period for the festivals in the US and the UK appears pretty crowded. Outside the major festivals that you guys highlighted on the press release, is there -- is that having any -- is there any impact adversely on consumer demand in some of those other festivals given the crowded slate? And then also with the 2021 Rock in Rio rescheduled for 2022, does that mean you will have that festival two years in a row now '23 also?
Michael Rapino: Well, I'll answer it backward. We'll -- we're debating the Rock in Rio decision, so we'll get to that -- Rock in Rio decision, we'll get to that later after we get '22 done. No, we don't have any fear of a crowded slate. I think as you saw maybe some of our releases, we just went up with Travis Scott yesterday or the day before and sold 100,000 tickets or Club (inaudible) went up because long -- it's biggest on sale ever. And Rolling Loud just was amazing. We sold 100,000 tickets in about an hour and had 200,000 people in the waiting line. So we're just seeing demand beyond any other historic moment. So Garth Brooks, this morning, I'm so proud, he broke every Ticketmaster record in history for the fastest stadium sale out. So I'm thrilled for the crowd, but I'm more thrilled that our ongoing investment in Ticketmaster and the amount of strain that causes to be the fastest-selling stadium in history or do 100,000 tickets in an hour is a testament to the Ticketmaster platform because the demand, the bots,  the load that hits you in that hour is amazing. So I'm proud that the Ticketmaster team is delivering, but also the demand right now is far exceeding any of our scheduling festivals right now.
Stephen Glagola: Thanks, Michael. And one more, if I can. Just you spoke about the NFT impact and blockchain impact on your Ticketmaster operations. From the standpoint of artists potentially making more money, monetizing their back catalog or whatnot, does that make them become less reliant on touring as an earnings driver going forward in your view?
Michael Rapino: Not sure if that was a statement or a question. But no, I would say that I think you've got to look at the macro pie always, right? There is always going to be a few artists that are able to sell their business at the top end. But if you look at the macro numbers, the percentage that comes from the road, the amount of artists that are dying to get back on the road, we're seeing right now a greater demand than ever from artists calling us saying, when could we get back out? And these are some very successful and wealthy artists. So we always look at that two hours on stage at a stadium is a drug that, that artist tends to want to run for his entire career. So we don't see any decline in that desire for that artist to get on stage. I think the reason you see Mick Jagger and The Stones on stage isn't financial at this point. I think it delivers something much bigger than a paycheck. So I think that magic moment on stage is non-duplicatable for the fan and something that artist doesn't get at home.
Stephen Glagola: Yes. Looking forward to going back to shows in the second half. Thanks, Michael.
Michael Rapino: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Katz: Hi. Good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. There's been an awful lot of discussion about the near-term demand. I wonder what data points or information or perspectives you might have about demand beyond, say, the next 12 or 18 months, and how you think about sort of the demand curve longer term?
Michael Rapino: Yes. (Multiple Speakers) I guess if you're going to model that out, you'd probably -- you'd be thrilled that your first data point is the biggest demand in history. So I think however you model that out for the next, you know, I don't think you're going to see any cliff on that demand. I don't think these consumers are saying, I can't wait to get through '22, and then it's over. So I think this is showing. I mean, look, we always look at the -- I think the most important demand curve is the 17, 16 and 14 year-old of today excited about going to the show as the last kind of generation, right. We always get that question on who is the next Rolling Stones. And our data will continually show that, that young artist is capable of selling out stadiums and arenas very fast. I mean, Bad Bunny just went on sale and sold out arenas very fast, huge Latino star. So we're just seeing pockets of strengths coming from young artists every day. Billie Eilish is selling out instantly. So we see young artists regenerating the supply side. We see new 14-year olds going crazy for BTS all around the globe. That's a part to me is what I look at is, is it still as important to a 14 year old to see from the Beatles to go to NSYNC to Backstreet to Britney Spears to BTSs of today, right? So they seem to be -- my 10 year old is excited about concerts as I was when I was 10 or even more, I guess, so where he is based. But we see a great young vibrant supply demand in the business, to me, that's what you want to model in. And over time, it's still as important to a 15 year old of today and a 20 year old of today as it was 10 and 20 years ago.
David Katz: Thank you. Sorry. Go ahead.
Joe Berchtold: And David, just one other thing to add. I wouldn't just use what are the on sales of the past month as part of your indicator. This is a supply-constrained business with a lot of latent demand out there. And if you look at the past decade, and you look at how Live Nation went from 40 million fans a year to 100 million fans a year, it was by bringing more artists to more markets to more people, and unlock that latent demand because of the desire that Michael talked about. So there is a long track record that would say, concern about is the demand going to be there when you've got these great artists out on the road.
David Katz: Agreed. And if I may follow up quickly. With respect to M&A, how are you thinking about sort of the timing and the boundaries and the catalysts for maybe getting out and putting some deals back on the board to grow that way?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. We -- go ahead.
Michael Rapino: Yes. No, I was just saying, I think we're -- we've been looking at our current pipe. We have a good pipe that was already in process when COVID started. We probably have 15 to 20 different venues around the world that are in some level of construction or development or opening, those are on plan, and we'll be opening up from theaters to amphitheaters. We've got an ongoing list of promoters and festivals around the world that we've been in conversations with. We've been closed a couple of those recently, and we'll keep doing that. So we will continue on our bolt-on strategy as we have been for many years to keep bolstering our global foundation and opportunity markets.
Joe Berchtold: We're a growth business, and whether it's growth CapEx or M&A, we're going to be continuing to invest in the business. We're obviously, at a higher leverage level, but we are confident that as we continue to grow our AOI and that returns in 2022 and beyond, that we'll have plenty of flexibility to continue to drive that growth.
David Katz: I appreciate it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Jessye McVane: Hi. It's actually, Jessye McVane on for Ryan. Thanks for taking our question. Last call, you guys talked about ticket sales in the UK benefiting once guidelines and timelines for reopenings. But put in place, when we see states like New York announced this week that they will start to remove capacity restrictions later this month, or other states like Texas have already acted on. Are you seeing a similar step-change in demand here in the US? Or does it need to be done at a national level to have a similar effect?
Joe Berchtold: We're absolutely seeing massive demand. I mean today is a great example, we added the first half dozen shows -- broadway shows have their presales wildly outperformed all expectations. So just whatever it was two or three days ago, they relaxed in New York on sales today, going great. Governors Ball, as Michael referred to, went on sale, far and away, the best first day for Governors Ball. So as every market is getting unlocked, that's telling the fans to be comfortable going out and buying the tickets, and it's consistent as we go market-to-market.
Jessye McVane: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator on today's call. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release, reconciliation and other financial and statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As we look back on 2020, it is clearly not the year anyone predicted, but I'm very proud of how Live Nation has dug in and focused on turning this challenge into an opportunity to improve our business. I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their resilience and creativity and acknowledge all of those affected by COVID and the shutdown of live events. Over the last year, leaders across all of our business lines, Concerts, Ticketing and Sponsorship, have been analyzing ways to improve their business. Some of the key initiatives include reorganizing to become more nimble while also reducing our cost structure by $200 million; building concert streaming and direct-to-consumer businesses to expand our revenue streams; advancing our technology initiatives globally while accelerating the shift to digital tickets to meet changing needs of fans, venues and artists; and reinforcing our balance sheet to endure this period while maintaining a strong position to build our business for the future and act on opportunities as we identify them such as our recent acquisition of the streaming platform, Veeps; and continued pipeline bolt-on acquisitions throughout the globe. So, while this past year has been challenging for the company, our employees, fans, artists, and so many others globally impacted by COVID, I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We continue to have a substantial tailwind in the live event industry as consumers, more than ever, are looking to spend on experiences. The supply-demand fundamentals of the concert business remained strong with artists ready to get back on the road and fans eager to reconnect at events. All our data continues to show that there is substantial pent-up demand for concerts on the consumer demand side. The $2.4 trillion projected surplus in savings in the U.S. alone by June is a key indicator of consumer spending potential. At the same time, surveys demonstrate the high demand for concerts globally with 95% of fans likely to attend a show when restrictions are lifted. This is proving out in fan behavior as well with 83% of fans continuing to hold on to their tickets with rescheduled shows. On the artist side, there's a broad desire to get back on stage to connect with their fans and provide economic support to their bands, crew, and hundreds of others employed each night putting on the show. Given the limited touring activity in 2020 and '21, the pipeline for 2022 is much stronger than usual with almost twice as many major touring artists on cycle in 2022 in a typical year, about 45 artists versus the usual 25, and there remains plenty of scheduling availability at arenas, amphitheaters, and stadiums to accommodate these additional tours with over 2/3 of these venue nights unused by sporting events or major concerts in a typical year. It appears that the timing to release the pent-up supply and demand is now approaching. Vaccine distribution is accelerating and declines in COVID cases throughout most of the world gives us even more confidence that a safe and meaningful return to shows will soon be possible. For both the U.S. and U.K., projections indicate that everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by May or June in Europe and most other markets following a few months later. Given the mass social and economic toll the lockdown has put on the public, we believe there will be strong momentum to reopen society swiftly as soon as vaccines are readily available, and we believe outdoor activity will be the first to happen. So, while the timing of return to live will continue to vary across global markets, every sign points to beginning safely in many countries sometime this summer and scaling further from there. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our financial results. 
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we did for Q3, we've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to on the call. For the fourth quarter, all the key costs and cash numbers are in line with or better than what we forecasted last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. As part of this, we further reduced discretionary spending by another $50 million and closed 2020 with over $950 million in lower costs. We also reduced our cash usage by $1.65 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans, $150 million more than we were projecting last quarter. Looking at our Q4 AOI results, our AOI loss for the quarter was $244 million, which consisted of $290 million in operational fixed costs and $46 million of contribution margin, which included $96 million contribution from operations along with various one-time items. As we pointed out last quarter, this contribution margin from operations includes our sponsorship business where we've been able to maintain close to 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February last year. Half of this sponsorship moved into 2021 while the portion we retained in 2020 was repurposed into other assets, including streaming concerts. Our artist management and merchandise businesses also generated positive contribution margin in the quarter. Looking at free cash and liquidity, we ended the fourth quarter with $643 million in free cash, which increased to $1.1 billion in early January with our debt raise. This, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity gives us $2 billion in readily available liquidity. Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $308 million or $103 million per month. We had $97 million per month average in operational burn plus another $44 million per month of nonoperational cash costs to get us to $142 million average per month in gross burn. And then we had $39 million per month in cash contribution margin and ended up with a total effective cash burn of $103 million per month. Now ticket refunds. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the prior quarter at 17% through the end of Q4. For the tours that have gone through a second refund window, the refund levels were generally much lower for the second window as the casual fans requested their refunds during the first window. Festivals  generally canceled their 2020 events. But for festivals where fans could retain their tickets for next year's show, 63% of fans are doing so. On deferred revenue, at the end of the fourth quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.5 billion versus the $1.4 billion we projected at the end of Q3, higher due to $100 million in ticket sales during the quarter. Finally, our 2021 outlook. We won't be giving a multi-quarter outlook given the uncertainty on specific timing and likely varied timing for different markets around the world. For Q1, we will remain focused on our cash burn rate and particularly managing our total effective burn rate to ensure cash contribution margin growth outstrips any increases in our cost structure as we start to ramp back up. With that, let's open up the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy or me. Operator?
Operator:  Your first question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky: Michael, for the U.S. and U.K. markets, can you expand a bit on what you think we'll see this summer in terms of concerts? Can you get back the whole tours and some major festivals or do you sort of envision operating in a more kind of smaller regional basis? And then as a follow-up, I'd be interested to understand how artists are approaching the decision on when the right time to get back on the road is.
Michael Rapino: Yes. I think this summer, we're going to see a bit of a regional model -- a module model. Every day, we seem to have a new state or country talking about when they'll open up. So we're feeling more optimistic than we were a month ago. Lots of artists are calling and looking at how we start up in July, August, September, maybe move things a month. So for right now, we still believe that we'll have enough open throughout the U.K., Australia, Canada, U.S., to keep what we have on the books and the amphitheater booked for now. We might have some certain states that might not be ready, but we have enough states, we think, and enough artists willing to play the open slots if we get to that level in the right markets. So right now, we think we have enough artists. And as long as these states open up to the right capacities, we can start mid-summer into Southern U.S. We could go all the way to November.
Joe Berchtold: And then -- this is Joe. The only thing I would add is, if you look at the U.K. as a model, I think what they've laid out is a series of thresholds and timelines to reopen and really get almost fully  June has been very helpful and has really created a big burst of consumer demand over this week. And as a result, if you look at our U.K. festivals in August, Creamfields has already sold out. Reading & Leeds saw a huge jump in consumer demand, and those are both likely to be sold out this weekend. So, we do see that in the U.K. with the help of  we're going to be able to get those festivals to happen certainly in August.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on that point, assuming kind of conditions start to normalize faster than expected. Can you maybe just say how much lead time you need to ramp-up activities at your various venue types? And are there kind of acts that you can lean on to fill supply in short notice? 
Michael Rapino: Yes. We're running about a 3-month lead time. So, we've been talking to our global employees about that kind of timeline, when we kind of have the first show at scale that we think is going to happen beyond 50%. three months back from that is when we can start bringing back marketing production, all of the key venue functions. So, everyone is eager, employees to get back out, and we can wrap up in between the on sale or the announcement and the actual show with no challenges.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Glagola with Cowen.
Stephen Glagola: Earlier this month, Ticketmaster rolled out its new live stream product and you purchased the Veeps platform as well a month ago. The online live market appears to be a more nascent market. Could you discuss how you expect this business to impact the P&L in '21? Maybe high level, just the economics of ticketing virtual events, how that compares to sort of ticketing a regular live show? And how Ticketmaster is positioned in this market relative to the competition?
Michael Rapino: Right. We look at it -- obviously, we have to solve two different problems. Live Nation looks to be in this space because we think, as I've said before, it's a great complement to our core physical product. We're still not sure if this is a business or a feature, but we think we've been streaming our live shows from Yahoo! Live to Twitter. We stream most of our festivals for many years on YouTube and other platforms. So, streaming a festival or streaming a live show for a sponsor or for other platforms, we've been doing that a long time. This is just now an opportunity with Veeps to do some of that direct-to-consumer on the club shows, amphitheater, festival shows that we think will have that added capacity and demand that will help increase some of the revenue for the artist. So, we think it's kind of like a T-shirt and merchandise in a VIP platform. It's another incremental revenue stream to the current physical show. We think we have a unique advantage because we have the sort of 30,000 physical shows. So, when we're putting those on sale, just like today, we try to sell you an upgrade, VIP package or a T-shirt, for those that can't come to the show -- but possibly even if you come to the show and you want some -- to look at some other camera angles on your phone, we think it's a good complement or an add-on to our physical show. Ticketmaster just wanted to make sure this is a new product. Whether it's like festivals or clubs, we wanted to make sure that they had the capability to service events and clients coming to them saying, "Hey, I have a virtual show going on sale. Can you ticket it for me since you have such a large database and the -- then the scale and competency?" So we're proud that, that team in COVID was able to take some existing software and quickly ramp up and has been able to service many shows around the globe because that's kind of instantly a global product when you're putting a virtual show on sale. So, we think Ticketmaster will probably be one of the leaders in that space. Most of the platforms or most of the live shows you've seen have come to Ticketmaster and said, "We'd love you to ticket it. You have the capability, and you have the marketing reach that we don't." So that's been successful to date. Same business model, it's a service fee model. Most of the platforms you see out there are charging a service fee on the ticket, and that's what Ticketmaster is also doing, and that seems to be the accepted model to date. So, we think it's another product in the channel or their portfolio that Ticketmaster can effectively deliver for the customer. How big of this segment, this ultimately is in the end. I think it continues or will be -- -- once like it's been on YouTube, it's always been an interesting way for a customer to see some of the live show. History says that live show though, thanks to Tiktok and Instagram, is not consumed in mass. Most people don't want to watch two hours of their favorite band. They want to find that one great shot on Tiktok. So, we're still not sure how big of a business a live show is, but it's something that is incremental to our course. So, we'll be on it, same with Ticketmaster.
Stephen Glagola: Michael, that was really helpful. And maybe one more for just Joe and Kathy. On your -- you guided total CapEx to $150 million in '21. It's down 30% or so from '20 levels. Down, I think, over 40% from 2017 to '19 levels. The '17 and '19 was a really significant CapEx ramp period for the business. Is the '21 CapEx moderation or deceleration is something we should expect going forward as we look out to some of the outer years, '22 and beyond?
Joe Berchtold: This is Joe. I'll start. I think 2021 CapEx is more a reflection of the fact that we're continuing to be prudent in our cash management this year. I think as we get back to '22, we spend CapEx based on the opportunities we see. We continue to see great opportunities on the concert side in terms of going into new markets, adding new venues, continuing to build out that business. So you'll see that accelerate, ramp back up in '22 along with continuing to find ways to invest in the venues that we have to get a fan throughout that portfolio.
Operator:  Your next question is from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.
Brandon Ross: A couple of questions. First, I wanted to ask a follow-up on David's question, leading off about reopening. And Michael, you tweeted out earlier an article about the Reading & Leeds Festivals being set to take place this summer. They're large-scale events. Can you describe some of the safety plans that are being contemplated for those? And whether they're meaningful in terms of cost? And kind of how you see the fan experience looking when we open festivals like that?
Michael Rapino: I'm going to let Joe handle the safety part. I'm going to come back to the sales on that one, though.
Joe Berchtold: Just in terms of the -- in terms of the protocols, number one, obviously, we have some additional cleaning protocols that are in place. Those are not a -- those are not a huge cost. And then one of the big changes is the shift to much more contactless. So as we get the digital ticket really fully implemented and out there, the ability to have contactless interest -- entry, contactless purchase of food and beverage, contactless purchase of merch, all of that is going to improve the fan experience, provide some safety and comfort to the fans, and I think only be a better overall experience.
Michael Rapino: And Brandon, just because you brought it up, just to show you when we keep talking about pent-up demand. Reading & Leeds went on sale, thanks to the government-outlined new plan for the summer, and sold 100,000 tickets in 72 hours. Creamfields went on sale and sold out in 48 hours, over 70,000. So we are seeing the fan and what we've been talking about, they are excited to get back to the show as soon as we get the green lights in these markets to open up.
Brandon Ross: Great. And you gave some details around the Ticketmaster globalization initiative a few months back at the Liberty Day. I wanted to unpack that a little further. Can you maybe describe the overall margin opportunity for ticketing? Is it a business that as this globalization effort is implemented, can make Ticketmaster have a more typical marketplace margin structure? And then maybe describe how long the process will take and whether we're going to see continuous benefits as it plays out.
Joe Berchtold: This is Joe, Brandon. I'll start that by getting into some of the numbers. I think part of this is in that -- the $200 million cost reduction that we told you was going to take place. Ticketmaster is a large portion of that. Ticketmaster's cost or, I guess, their revenue was about $1.5 billion in 2019. So if you apply a good chunk of the cost savings to that, you get mid-single-digit margin expansion from that cost savings off the bat. We expect that, over time, as we get even more efficient, more globalized than the Ticketmaster platform, there will be some additional savings. But as importantly, it will let us go into new markets faster. And also, when we add new capabilities in the U.S., those can be instantly rolled out worldwide. So we'll be able to drive revenue along with the reduced cost.
Brandon Ross: Cool. And then just finally, as things reopen and you come out of the pandemic fairly levered, I wanted to ask your early thinking on capital allocation. If there are international assets at attractive prices out there, would that take precedent over delevering? And how do you balance the opportunities that may present themselves abroad as you continue that international roll-up versus sort of a leverage target?
Joe Berchtold: This is Joe. I'll start. I think that we're very comfortable with the leverage that we're at now. We are not in a rush to delever. We think it will naturally happen over time given the performance levels that we think are going to be happening starting in 2022. So we remain, as we said, in a very liquid state, around $2 billion of total liquidity, including untapped debt right now. We don't think the vast majority of that will be necessary this year. So it gives us a lot of dry powder as we look at our global set of opportunities and bolt-on acquisitions.
Michael Rapino: And Brandon, to pick up on that. As you've seen us over the last 10 years, this space, on a global basis, tends to be a lot of small bolt-ons. So we've been ramping up our 100-plus million customers, doubled it over the last few years, and we'll continue to grow those numbers. But we don't have to make $1 billion acquisitions to make any of that come to life. We were talking the $20 million range is a lot of where we pick up a festival, a venue, a promoter that's accretive and in a key market for us. So we'll continue to be acquisitive on our theater, club, global business, any markets we think there's opportunities that arise given where the world sits today. So we will be aggressive on a bolt-on, continued consolidation path while we are able to. We think '22 is a peak year, which lets us start taking a lot of free cash flow and start working towards delevering also. So we think we can accomplish both as we have over the years.
Operator:  We do have a question from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital.
Paul Golding: So Michael, you talked about the 3-month lead time on possibly a 50% capacity show. I guess when we think about the recent news in New York around the 10% arena capacity limit now being allowed, how should we think about how artists are sort of phasing back in? You've had peers say that, that just isn't enough for financial reasons to justify an event. How should we think about sort of that breakeven where artists may decide to get out there early if states start opening up even earlier?
Michael Rapino: Well, I think you look at the U.K. and Australia as kind of the key markets, right, where they went from -- once COVID and they had the right game plan. They have now set a clear date when 100% capacity can happen outdoor, then it's kind of business as usual. So we have not, as to date, done a lot of work in the 0 to 50% capacity business. We don't see that as a viable model to ramp back up fixed cost. So we think we're close enough though where we are with COVID and with all the governors in the states we're talking to, that there will be a clear outline to a 75% to 100% outdoor green light in '21. So we think we're better off waiting for a high bar capacity moment in most of the states to ramp up and talk to the artists about getting paid properly. So we think that's within sight and is better -- is closer than having to dabble in the 10% and 20s, but those are great steps forward.
Paul Golding: Great. And then with the downtime, have you seen maybe a broader set of venues more aggressively roll out components of the SafeTix or Presence platform in venue?
Joe Berchtold: This is Joe. Obviously, during the shutdown, most of the venues have been shut down as well. So there hasn't been a lot of specific rollout during the time as much as there is a massive sign-up of venues that are looking to shift to a paperless digital ticketing going forward. And for those that have already adopted digital ticketing to some extent, looking to expand it and really having it be the way that entry takes place.
Paul Golding: So maybe some pent-up rollout demand when things reopen so that you can roll out quickly?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. Yes.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. Management, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing or additional remarks.
Michael Rapino: All right. Thank you, everyone. Stay safe, and we'll talk to you on our next earnings call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator on todayâs call. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainmentâs Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Todayâs conference is being recorded. Following managementâs prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. Instructions will be given at that time. Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoonâs call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ including statements related to the companyâs anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nationâs SEC filings including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the companyâs most recent filings on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risk and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release reconciliation and other financial or statistical information could be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nationâs website at investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. There're been no major changes in our business conditions or outlook since the last time we spoke. And while we see signs of promise around the world with some live events return. Most regions we operate in continue to have various restrictions unlike this. For now we continue to maintain a strong cash management discipline while planning for the ramp up to resume live shows as soon as possible. Joe will have a further update on costs and cash management efforts later in the call. We also continue to see strong fan demand across the board. Our sales and survey data tell us fan demand will be there when the time is right. Our refund rate on reschedule shows remain consistently low with 83% of fans globally keeping their tickets. A recent global survey indicates that 95% of fans are planning to return to live events when restrictions are lifted, the highest point of confidence since the start of the pandemic. Festival on sales for next year have been strong with EDC Las Vegas 2021 selling out in 24 hours with a higher capacity than last year. And ticket sales for Red and Greenfields and other White festivals pacing ahead of last year. And we encouraged by the enthusiasm for recent events and gatherings that have started to take place including our first sold out tour with 20,000 fans in New Zealand where business is headed back to normal. Meanwhile, we are working on a roadmap to get back to live safely. We are encouraged by progress on testing technology treatments and vaccines which will help us build our plans. We still expect shows at scale next summer but recognize that some exact timeline of this return will vary by region and so we continue to focus on remaining flexible. In preparation there are two areas we are focusing on. On the technology front, Ticketmaster is creating the tools we need to make sure live events can deliver a variety of safe precautions when returning. New products such as our social distancing seat mapping tool and time entry technology have been created to give venues the flexibility to plan how to manage everything from venue access to box office interactions. Existing products including our safe text digital ticket technology can fulfill new needs including being a key facilitator for contact tracing. And the ability to integrate third party applications with our digital ticketing platform enable the range of customizable features from contact list with concessions to testing and health questionnaire tracking. On the content front, Live Nationâs developing a set of standards for executing shows that our vendors. We are collaborating with health experts to develop show guidelines to put in place procedures, which can adapt to various situations across all regions. From venue sanitation procedures to fan friendly policies and on ticket purchases and the latest testing options, we are setting standards that will give the fans, crews and artists peace of mind before, during and after the show. If we look ahead it is through the past to Live will not be a straight one. With as such, we will maintain flexibility and focus on innovating during these times. On November 19th at our Investor event, we will outline more detail the opportunities we see emerging for our business. With that, I'll turn over to Joe.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone. We've added some additional tables to the back of our earnings release, so this quarter I will hit the key numbers as opposed to reconciling in every number as I did last quarter. As Michael noted, we've continued to strengthen our financial position during the third quarter and all the key numbers are in line with or better than what we forecast last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. As part of this, we have further reduced all discretionary spending by another approximately $100 million and have now lowered to us for this year by over $900 million and reduce our cash usage by $1.5 billion relative to our pre-COVID plants. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $110 million per month and our gross burn rate to $175 million per month on average for the last nine months of the year and prior to the benefit of contribution margin generated by the business. Included in our gross burn estimate is approximately $40 million in severance expense estimated through year-end which we expect to generate over $200 million in annual run rate savings. Our free cash at the end of the third quarter is $951 million and along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, we have $1.9 billion in readily available liquidity. At the same time refund rates for Q3 remain low at 17% globally. As a result deferred revenue is at $1.4 billion as of the end of Q3. And we have increased our forecast than what we expect at the end of the year now $1.4 billion. Turning to our Q3 results starting with AOI, our AOI loss for the quarter was $319 million which consisted of $337 million in operational cash burn, $50 million in other non-cash fixed costs and $68 million of contribution margin, which included $73 million from operations along with other one-time items. One point to note here is that this same from operations includes our sponsorship business where we've been able to maintain 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February. The bulk of this sponsorship moved into 2021, but some of it was repurposed into other assets including streaming concerts. Looking at free cash we ended the third quarter with $951 million in free cash compared to $1.8 billion at the end of Q2 in line with what we expected and consistent with what we told you last quarter. This translates to an $821 million reduction in our free cash metric for the quarter. Part of this, we had a reduction in free cash of $333 million due to working capital timing, which is part of the $415 million flip we told you last quarter would be happening in Q3 and Q4. We expect the remaining $80 million of this timing impact will affect free cash in Q4. The majority of this timing shift resulted from show scheduled for Q3 of 2021 shifting from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue. So it is an accounting shift as opposed to actually use of cash. As a result, our total effective cash burn was $488 million for the quarter or approximately $160 million per month, which aligns with our gross cash burn net of contribution margin generated in the quarter. Now ticket refunds, as I indicated, the global refund rate for Live Nation Concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 17% through the end of Q3. Festivals have generally canceled this year's event. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show 63% of fans are doing so and keeping their tickets. A bit more detail on deferred revenue, which is tracking ahead of where we told you last quarter we were going to be. At the end of the third quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.4 billion. Of the $421 million increase, $383 million was due to a shift from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue for concerts rescheduled Q3 of 2021. At the end of the third quarter, we still had $103 million of long-term deferred revenue most of which equipped to short term deferred revenue by the end of the year. Given this, along with the projected Q4 outflow of $74 million from additional ticket refunds, we now forecast deferred revenue of $1.4 billion at the end of the year prior to any additional ticket sales. Given the uncertainty in the market on timing of shows returning, we cannot give any more guidance beyond the burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. With that, letâs open the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy, or me.
Operator:  Thank you. And your first question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just recognizing that 2021 may be a fairly unique year in terms of how concerts and festivals are structured. But when you look at 2022 which is the long term general, are you confident that the general economics that drove the concerts industry will return or should investors expect some sort of change as it pertains to relationships with artists, the venues or really on any front?
Joe Berchtold: I think the baseline economics the promoter the artist the venue those economics will not materially change structurally going forward. I think what you'll see and we've hit a few points is as we've spent this time continuing to think about our business, we've looked at how it is. We can take some costs out. And I give you some numbers on over $200 million in reduced run rate. And we've also spent our time thinking about just how does each piece of the flywheel operate a bit better going forward. And how do we keep thinking about new ways to drive the overall economics of the business. But I don't see any change in the core historical dynamics on the key players.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And then just to follow-up on the $200 million should we think of that as permanent cost savings or some of that comes back when the industry begins to scale up again?
Joe Berchtold: I think as we look at 2021 we expect to see those savings to be largely in place and then 2022 is we've got to wait and see exactly what the scale is. The 2022 is as big as we think it could -- then we'll see what costs are needed. But we think that the bulk of this flows through the business and there is a structural savings.
David Karnovsky: And then maybe just to ask one a little bit long-term in nature. You know an area that's got a little bit more attention lately is virtual concerts. I just wondering if you could update your views on the opportunities to the Live Nation either as it pertains to selling incremental virtual access to your shows or just continuing to stage your own productions like you've done recently with Live From Home? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: Thank you. It's Michael. We believe that virtual is a great complement to the car business. You know there's going to be always beyond says in BTS and Billie Eilish of the world can probably do like the old school pay per view if you think of it that way. There's always a few global superstars that probably can go direct and drive some significant dollars. But generally this business we think is a complement to and a promotion to their core concert. So we think it's a great opportunity. Listen we've been dabbling in virtual for years whether it was streaming through Twitter and Yahoo and stream and ourselves for sponsors. We've been streaming our festivals on YouTube for years. We now look at that as a continuation of that and we think going into 2021 and 2022 will be streaming a lot more of our concerts to fans that maybe either can't show up at the event or some that may want to still stream on our app when they're at the event because there's some added value of digital backrooms or camera angles et cetera. So we think it's a great compliment helps us probably drive a few incremental dollars per show and also as always been a great tool for sponsorship fulfillment.
Operator: Your next question is from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.
Brandon Ross: Hey guys. What I really want to know is who won Georgia. But short of that wanted to take a step back on Ticketmaster with Jerd's departure you promoted your head of international who's that actually based abroad. Is there anything to â hello? Is there anything to read into that? Is international a bigger focus and more broadly maybe if you could discuss the strategic priorities that Ticketmaster under the new leadership.
Michael Rapino: Thanks Brandon. You know there's nothing to read. This is like everyone is probably saying COVID excelled any strategy you had in our case while we've been sitting tight, we've been able to do a bunch of restructuring and really thinking of the business. But we had planned over the next three years that we were able to do in the last three months. So going global on Ticketmaster was always the number one priority. We always knew that our greatest opportunity for you know kind of the TAM on Ticketmaster is going to be outside of the US. It's an incredible powerful brand. We've expanded into markets where Live Nation has content. It's an allocation market. So as youâre concerts grow, you can feed your ticketing business. So itâs been a huge opportunity. We haven't been successful at getting the global technology architecture excelled as fast as we wanted. The US is always such a big kind of drag on resources when we're running at full steam that we always get that projects get slightly pushed back to solve the latest US technology need. This is one let us excel the strategy that says we're going to now have one global technology stack a much better efficient architecture around it, common global products that we can roll out at once and help excel our international expansion. So I myself am the product when I moved from Toronto to London and lived there for five years. I think it was the single reason Live Nation is what it is today. And Place Global is when you see from the outside in all the opportunity it gets you â it gets you thinking differently. So I believe that the fastest way we would grow Ticketmaster to a global brand was let someone from the global side who's working that what business every day take the reins and drive that product. So we're even working with Mark for years and they've been having a product strategy to get there. We just excelled the leadership team to do it now. Sorry go ahead.
Brandon Ross: Go ahead. No, you go ahead.
Michael Rapino: Yeah. I think the priorities haven't changed when we get back to business they're going to continually be about, weâve got an incredible two businesses that Ticketmaster were at the core were enterprise platform, white labeling teams and venues all around the world. So whether it's the NFL or the Phoenix Suns or ultimately artists were great software platform to power your ticket needs. And we're going to get better at better at that in terms of our do it yourself and white label in and empowering artists and venues and teams to deliver their ticketing needs. It's been a great kind of test platform is the virtual business. We've overnight had to become a virtual ticketing company at scale across the globe and we've been able to do that. We are powering through our portfolio all of these virtual shows and selling tickets to them. So that's been what we do at our core. And then two we've always talked about being a better marketplace making sure that the marketplace the approximately, making sure that we have full inventory on the shelves, adding more inventory to the shelves. Whether it's Ticketmaster clients or not being a true marketplace where consumers can find tickets buy them stock the shelves through secondary third-party partners adding more content to the shelves, that is the strategy. So this does take that global and those two core strategies continue. We've got lots of clients to service on a global basis. We're underserviced â in under markets shared in many markets where our concepts are strong. And we're rolling out our global marketplace best-in-class practices across our global marketplaces that are sitting on old platforms.
Brandon Ross: Great. And then a few weeks ago Marc Geiger had announced his Save Life Club roll-off wondering what impact if any. You think he can have on the industry with that?
Michael Rapino: The same one he had at William Morris. But I think that there's a lot of talk on the independent venues save our stages et cetera. And there's no doubt everyone in live service providers and companies are having a rough year. We've been being very focused on making sure that the 12 million employees in Live from the hairdresser to the lighting crew to the security guards are get some stimulus and help. We think those people are in the most need. So, we've been very vocal about that. When it gets to the venues in general the thesis out there with Mark Geiger and some others is that these independent venues are so distressed that they're going to throw someone the keys at a very cheap price and you can maybe roll up some of these cheaply and have some scale. Well, the thesis is basically broken at the first point is any great Live club is not throwing anybody in the keys cheaply. There's a lot of capital out there. So if you on the Troubadour in Los Angeles, it's a legendary business and you're having a tough year. You're not selling to Mark Geiger or anyone else, if one or two time multiple your access to capital PPE loans lots of ways you can keep your business afloat, while you get through the storm. So we don't think that there's a huge opportunity that that there's a fire sale happening at that level. Now number two as you know we -- weâre the -- we have a consolidation of clubs in our business. Clubs on their own are a tough business, if you scale them up on their own. They're not -- they're not a really, really fruitful business on their own. So, we like them as part of our -- our overall ecosystem. But we're -- we don't believe that clubs whether you own 10, or whether you own 20 of them on their own provides you much global synergy or US synergy to leverage off of. So we hope all of these clubs find their way through this pandemic like we -- we hope all Live service providers find their way through this and that the government and stimulus programs and can help them survive it. But we donât think that that thereâs probably many that are going to fire to anybody, because thereâs too many great options for them.
Operator: Your next question in queue is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Ben Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. First Michael just what are you hearing from artists and artist managements on getting back out. And I'm specifically wondering, what's your best guess in terms of timing when we start to see major tours announced that eventually and tickets put on sale at âat scaleâ I was wondering what your latest crystal ball tells you.
Michael Rapino: Well, the important part is the demand there and the supplies there as we know, right. So that's obviously what we're playing for. So we know that the fans still are going to get to the show and we know the artists want to get back on the road when it's safe. And depending whether you're â what age you are as an artist you may have a different timeline and risk factor. But many artists that we're talking to are just waiting. As we all are looking on a week by week basis to figure out when is there a plan in place when they can start looking to get on the road. So we've been always talking to artists about if you have a 2022 or moved into 2021 for the summer into the fall. Let's hold on to that. Let's see how the next few months go through testing and vaccines and in a proper national plan et cetera. And we're telling any artist that has a new tour that's thinking of going on the road. Let's look at the fall, but we don't need to make those decisions until January, February. So if you have a new if you have a new tour well let's think about the fall into 2022 but let's sit tight until January before you start moving any costs in place to get ready. So that's kind of a -- that the general sense is let's -- let's reset, let's get through 2021 summer with whatever we reschedules from 2020, add new stuff into the fall to 2022 as we get a better visibility into January.
Ben Swinburne: That makes sense. Are there any insurance-related issues that you guys are having to work through, you know beside the festivals or any large events or do you think that's pretty well baked at this point?
Michael Rapino: You're talking about insurance on the historical what's happened to us this year?
Ben Swinburne: No, I mean more is you know we obviously see like in film production, the studios have to do are dealing with more and more â¦
Michael Rapino: Yeah.
Ben Swinburne: Health-related protection and insurance frankly from having to shut down. Just wondering, if that's impacting your business at all?
Michael Rapino: Well, because we're just talking about as Michael just said really summer of getting back to scale. I think first of all we remain optimistic that the government here in the US like many of them internationally if sorted out and made sure that there's not spurious liability from everybody doing the appropriate actions. And then that's why we've got the programs in place and what we're doing is we're working with the public health officials in every market to figure out what is it that there needs to be done for those markets to bring fans back safely as we get to next summer. And I think it's our expectation that as long as we're doing that that we're going to be in a fine position.
Ben Swinburne: Got it. And Joe if I could just ask you one to try to help us think through the fourth quarter use of cash and I know your looking forward to that question. Is there any way to think about the contribution margin that we might see in Q4 versus what you saw in Q3? If that seems to go in one area that might help you know benefit the cash burn number?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, really I can say is that I don't think Q2 and Q3 were that different from each other. Obviously some different pieces moving around, but they weren't wildly different. And I've given you the cash burn numbers operational and growth for nine months. So you can pretty easily do the calc on what that leaves over for Q4.
Ben Swinburne: Okay, thanks a lot. And Joe you mentioned the sponsorship already.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, 90% of our sponsorship commitments that we had as of the end of February have stayed in place. They've stayed in 2020 where possible and that's what's driven some of the CM that we had this quarter in particular with most of the rest of it rolling into next year.
Ben Swinburne: That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz, your line is open. Mr. Katz, your line is on mute. We'll move on to the next question. Your next in queue is from Doug Arthur with Hebert Research.
Doug Arthur: Yes. So I guess is the question for Michael or Joe. Based on all the costs that you have had to sort of take out to slow the burn. Is it fair to conclude that when business gets back to normal and obviously there'll be a surge of activity at some point that the underlying inherent margins of this company particularly on the concert segment may be higher on a longer term basis based on the kinds of rationalizations youâve done the things youâve found sort of added necessity. I mean, will there be structural change on a permanent basis?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. This is Joe. I'll start. The answer is yes. That's the over $200 million of cost savings from the severance that I talked about that we said will be out for the pursuable future. So that piece of it is out and then we'll manage bringing the other costs obviously as slowly as possible as needed to ramp up as we get into next year.
Michael Rapino: And just to add -- I just want to add to that one of the things I want to make sure we're -- it's not just about severance we've had a time to reengineer. So one of the strengths is like everyone's learned that that is a new tool for all of us is the work from home strategy. We were very decentralized organization with lots of offices from Tampa Bay to Cleveland. And we're now learning what everyone is learning. We can shut down a lot of those regional offices. We can have a work from home strategy. We can reduce our office burn, our monthly burn, and have a much more flexible workforce too. So work from home a decentralized service model like ours has been an incredible new gift to figure out how can we now restructure and still deliver the same volume without some of the costs. We've also reengineered where we need offices and how we can have a regional model versus maybe a local at times. So between reengineering and work from home, our goal has been both at Ticketmaster, Live Nation and globally to run at a $200 million annual run rate reduction on our fixed costs. That's our goal right now and into a full wrap up.
Doug Arthur: And just sort of following up on Ben's question on artists and maybe this is probably  but as things start to come back and thereâs a lot of demand for artists to get down the road thereâs probably some scheduling issues, do you think artist management teams will be more flexible on payouts particularly if you're restricted in terms of how many seats you can sell out initially in an amphitheater what have you. Are your conversations indicating flexibility on that side of the equation?
Michael Rapino: Yeah, 100%. I mean everyone has been affected by this understands the world's going to start differently. And it's going to require a slower ramp up. So we see it already and you see the driving shows. We're doing the social distance shows in Atlanta the rocks â Roxy on the weekend where we have maybe 20% to 40% attendance depending on the state. Those are all adjusted artist guarantees based on the capacity, so 100% the artist will be coming back to work and adjusting their expectations to the realities of the capacity as we all as an industry start to scale up from 25% to 100% eventually.
Operator: And we have David Katz with Jefferies.
David Katz: Very good. Thank you. Look I given the considerable financial endurance and the limited visibility around the trajectory of this recovery. I just wanted to hear your thoughts or perspectives about any sources of capital or any capital rising at this point.
Joe Berchtold: This is Joe. I think we don't see it as necessary at this point as we gave you a pretty detailed numbers on the burn. Current â and our current debt capacity in cash. We think that we've got enough to get us through until we ramp backup. Also remember that a lot of the cash starts flowing back into the business months before the shows themselves start because you've got the concerts going on sale, which generates the cash in the Ticketmaster and into sponsorship. So we think that will take us through this period until we can get ramp back up. At the same time, we know the same thing that you and everybody else knows is that there is tremendous liquidity out in the market should at some point that the need arise. But we just don't see it at this point.
Operator:  Your next question in queue is from Stephen Glagola with Cowen.
Stephen Glagola: Hi. Has the pandemic accelerated the shift for event organizers to utilize your digital ticketing technology and I just going back to the prior question on the Ticketmaster changes moving to the global tech stack et cetera. Do you expect these changes to push ticketing structural margins above that 29%, 30% threshold when business conditions normalize? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: So first of all on digital ticketing I think Michael spoke to the streaming and the fact that we see streaming has been a very interesting complement to our business going forward and we think it makes sense itâs an additional point of revenue for the artists and for the overall ecosystem. And when they do a show they can also stream it for fans in other markets who can't get to the sold out show and so on. So the ability to provide that digital ticket along with traditional tickets and do  more important and something we're doing right now. So no question on that and then in terms of TM team going forward and the globalization. Again Michael spoke to and we've given you some of the numbers on the cost reduction obviously a chunk of that is associated with Ticketmaster and how we think about driving that on a globalized platform and taking some of the rust and inefficiencies that might have existed in accelerating bringing that all together. I don't think we're going to give you specific numbers here today, but we certainly see overall some further reductions in the cost structure.
Stephen Glagola: All right. Appreciate that John. Just one more if I can. Obviously most people are you're seeing most people hold onto their tickets for shows that have been postponed. How many times can you move a show before you expect to see sort of the ticket buying public to give up on the show and demand a refund or you just cancel altogether? I believe maybe you might have moved them once or twice right now. If you do three or four times does that get into a situation where you just end up canceling altogether?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah. Look as Michael said the fundamental supply and demand dynamics have not changed. Artists want to tour. They need to tour for their livelihood. Fans want those tickets. You know six months ago we had a lot of folks saying no, no refunds in the 80%. Everybody's going to want their money back. Nobody's going to want. And that's proven fundamentally wrong. We're sitting at 17% six months later a fraction of what I think almost everybody was saying. And so we remain very confident that there's not going to be an exact formula. But fans who were able to get a good ticket for an artist they want to go to they're going to want to go to that show as soon as they possibly can whenever that is.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Over the past three months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectation that live events will return at scale is the summer of 2021, with ticket sales ramping up in the quarters leading up to these shows. And partly, we remain confident that fans will return to live events when it is safe to do so. Our strongest indicator of demand is that fans are holding onto their tickets even when given the option of a refund. Through the end of the second quarter, 86% of concert fans are keeping their tickets for rescheduled shows, demonstrating their continued desire to attend concerts in the future despite the current uncertainty. Our expectation for robust outdoor summer season in 2021 are also reinforced by the two-thirds of fans keeping their tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next yearâs show, along with a strong early ticket sales for the festivals in the UK next summer.  For example, downloads in the Isle of Wight are pacing well ahead of last year. Between the tickets held by fans for the rescheduled shows and these festival on sales, we have already sold 19 million tickets to more than 4,000 concerts and festivals scheduled for 2021, creating a strong base load of demand that is taking well ahead of this point last year. At the same time, surveys continue to show that concerts remain fansâ highest priority social event when it is safe to gather, with almost 90% of fans globally planning on attending concerts again. Understanding that itâll be some time before we put on concerts at scale, we are innovating to find new and creative ways to help artists keep fans connected in the meantime. Virtual concerts have proven to be a huge demand with fans, so we established a live from home platform to provide a convenient place for fans of all types to find the performances from their favorite artists. In the second quarter we had 67 million fans see over 18,000 concerts and festivals globally. Among our highlights, the past weekend we streamed 150 performances from our virtual Lollapalooza festival. Given the tremendous popularity of these shows, we are seeing the potential for live streaming to become an additional long-term component of our concert business, allowing fans in other cities or those who canât attend to enjoy the concert as well. At the same time, recognizing fans want to get back to attending concerts in person as soon as possible, weâve launched socially distant shows when and where permitted, included in New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and as well as cities across the U.S. While this is a challenging time for everyone, the live events business in particular, there are a few things that I am confident about. We are well-positioned to whether this crisis and we will get through this. When it is safe to return, weâll have an abundance of fan and artists ready to join live music again. And Live Nation will do everything in its power to meet our responsibilities to artists, fans, our employees and everyone else affected by this shutdown by bringing back as much live music as fast as possible when itâs responsible to do so. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our results.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As Michael mentioned, our top property during this time has been strengthening our financial position. And we are confident our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. We have now reduced costs for this year by over $800 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.4 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on operational cash burn rate to $125 million per month and our gross burn rate to $185 million per month on average for the second quarter through the end of the year. At the same time, we raised an additional $1.2 billion, providing us with a $1.8 billion of free cash at the end of the second quarter, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, totaling over $2.7 billion in readily available liquidity. And last week we amended our credit agreement to suspend our maintenance covenant to a more favorable liquidity metric to Q4 of 2021, providing us with added flexibility until business returns. Turning to our Q2 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI for the quarter was a loss of $432 million, driven primarily by operational fixed costs of $334 million, inclusive of approximately $60 million in benefits from various government payroll funding programs. So with our cost initiatives we expect operational fixed costs to average approximate $125 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. We then had negative $98 million in contribution margin, largely driven by one-time events in Ticketmaster and are concerts business. For Ticketmaster, recording refunds for 11 million tickets across 42,000 shows generated a loss of approximately $79 million for our portion of the service fees. In our Concerts business, writing off sunk costs associated with concerts that have been canceled or rescheduled for 2021 generated an expense of approximately $87 million, about two-thirds of which is write-off of advertising expenses given the calendar year shift in show timing. Partially offsetting these expenses, we had $68 million of contribution margin generated by business operations and insurance recoveries for events impacted by the pandemic. Looking at free cash, we ended the first quarter with approximately $820 million in free cash, added $1.2 billion in cash from additional debt during the second quarter and then ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of free cash. This implies $250 million in cash used during the quarter. As part of this, we had a timing benefit to free cash to $415 million which weâll put back out in Q3 and Q4. Of this timing benefit, $225 million has accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds and $190 million is working capital timing. This puts our total effective cash burn at $665 million for the quarter. The largest one-time impact was the payment of Ticketmaster refunds which totaled $110 million for our portion of service fees refunded to fans during the quarter. We then had our operational cash burn. Starting with our $334 million in operational fixed costs and adding back $54 million of non-cash benefits, our operational cash burn totals $388 million for the quarter. In addition, we had $217 million of ongoing nonoperational cash burn items, including capital expenditures, acquisition activity, net advances and interest payments. These items ran slightly higher for the quarter due to contractually obligated payments for past acquisitions, but we expect this nonoperational component to our cash burn to average approximately $60 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. Finally, we had $50 million of inflows from operations and improved cash management. Lastly, let me give you an update on ticket refunds and how thatâs impacted our deferred revenue. Ticket refunds first. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 14% through the end of Q2. Festivals have generally canceled this yearâs events. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next yearâs show as Michael mentioned about two-thirds of them are keeping their tickets. Across both concerts and festivals, weâve refunded $218 million for rescheduled shows since March. In addition, we have refunded $477 million for canceled shows over this period. Of this $695 million total, $230 million was funds held by third-party venues and $465 million from Live Nation held funds. We still have some shows in the process of rescheduling or are rescheduled but not yet offering refunds. If we apply the same fan behavior and mix on these events, we forecast approximately $270 million in additional fan refunds, of which about $180 million will be from Live Nation held funds. Given this estimate weâve shifted these funds from deferred revenue to accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds. Now to look at how these refunds flow through our event-related deferred revenue. At the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue for events over the next 12 months was $2 billion. At the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $941 million. Of this, approximately $1 billion decreased, $405 million was due to a shift from short-term deferred revenue to long-term deferred revenue as a number of concerts were shifted into the second half of 2021. As a result, we have $486 million of long-term deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter of which we estimate approximately $400 million was shipped back to short-term deferred revenue over the course of the year. The Live Nation concert ticket refunds recorded in the quarter then accounted for $465 million, an estimated additional future refunds from Live Nation health cash totaled $180 million. We then had ticket sales in the quarter that generated roughly $30 million in new deferred revenue. Looking at the rest of the year, our forecast for event-related deferred revenue at the end of the year prior to additional ticket sales and based on our projected refund rates is approximately $1.3 billion. Given all the uncertainty in the market and timing of shows, we cannot give you any further guidance beyond these burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. With that, Iâll turn the call over to Kathy.
Elizabeth Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our second quarter and six months results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first six months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of our shows since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic which is driving all of the variances for both periods in total and across all segments. For the quarter, our revenue was $74 million, compared to $3.2 billion last year, down 98%. AOI was a loss of $432 million for the quarter compared to earnings of $319 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $588 million compared to $172 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the quarter was $568 million compared to net income of $103 million in 2019. For the first six months, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue compared to $4.9 billion last year, down 71%. Most of this revenue in 2020 was driven by our show activity in the first two-and-a-half months of the year prior to the shutdown. AOI was a loss of $452 million for the first six months compared to income of $435 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $761 million compared to $148 million in operating income last year and net loss for the first six months was $752 million compared to net income of $51 million in 2019. Now onto our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our total cash includes $941 million of current event-related deferred revenue as well as $486 million of long-term deferred revenue for events that have been rescheduled more than one year out as of June 30. This is part of our operating cash and therefore provides us additional liquidity. As Joe outlined, we estimate that our actions to conserve cash eliminates or defers approximately $1.4 billion in cash outflows for 2020, which includes the cash portion of our approximately $800 million in cost savings along with the reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and reduce concert and ticketing advances. In May 2020, we issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027. As of the end of the quarter, our total debt was $4.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.4%. We also have $966 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. Last week we completed an amendment to our credit agreement which amends and further suspends our net leverage coveted until December 31, 2021, if we choose, replacing it with a minimum liquidity test of $500 million, which is measured against our free cash, available debt capacity and up to $250 million of our event-related deferred revenue. We believe that our free cash, together with our undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations until shows return. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million, giving us a total for the six months of $129 million. We are now estimating our full year spend to be approximately $215 million, down from our initial estimate for the year of $375 million. Of the remaining $86 million in capital expenditures for the year, approximately $30 million is for capitalized labor, for updates to our ticketing systems, with the remainder largely venue-related in large term projects.  With that, weâll open up for questions. Operator?
Operator:  And your first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.
Brandon Ross: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the very detailed prepared remarks. A couple of questions. First, can you tell us how youâre approaching on sales for 2021? Should we expect a similar cadence to the typical years? Or are you guys going to take more of a wait-and-see approach, given everything thatâs going on? And I assume in your cash burn guidance that you gave there is no top line in there at all and youâre assuming no on sales in 2021. Then I have a follow up.
Joe Berchtold: This is Joe. I will start these. In terms of the on sales timing, as we indicated, we expect to be returning to scale with next summer particularly focused on the amphitheaters and the festivals first. So I think that we would expect the usual timing of those on sales, which would typically be for amphitheaters around the end of the year. So we donât expect for the full year the same; we expect it to be more back half loaded. But we do expect the on sales to be somewhere around a few towards the end of the year and the bulk of them as we get into the first quarter of the year. Second question. In terms of the cash burn, the cash burn is with Iâll call it relatively limited inflows, more similar to what we have in Q2. So we did have some inflows but not, obviously, at scale or substantial. The cash burn numbers we gave you are assuming the status quo through Q4. And as we move further into it and we have better visibility on Q4, if there is some ramp ups and activity which would give us both increased contribution margin as well as increased costs, weâll guide you to that as we get closer. But we thought the more prudent simple thing to do at this point is to give you the status quo. And then as we have more going on, weâll increase both sides from there.
Brandon Ross: Got it. And then it was widely reported I guess in the rags that you tried to adjust artist terms for festivals and were met with pushback. Can you talk about what happened there and what was the outcome? And as you contract for 2021 shows, have you been able to share your risks with artists at all? And how have contracts been structured differently for 2021 shows and maybe going forward from there? Hello?
Michael Rapino: Sorry, Brandon, I had trouble with my mic. Yeah, the press got a hold of a work in progress, which was too bad, because it wasnât meant to be that. We, for a living, are negotiating deals with agents and managers. Thatâs the business model. Their job is to look for competition, and our job is to bid on these shows in different terms for different artists in different times. So the process is always fluid. Weâre obviously trying to do our side of the negotiation and the agents doing their side. This looked, I guess as it got reported, it was just a mid statement. It wasnât meant to be anything more than that. But what we really wanted to accomplish was I would just step back and say the industry overall has been amazing dealing with restructuring 2020 into 2021. The agents, the managers and all the artists all have been very cooperative, that understand that if you had a show this year and you wanted to reschedule next year, some compromise in the terms would have to be met. And the biggest risk we all had on the promoting side that we wanted to make sure we could incorporate was the refunds. Now the refunds, as weâve seen, have been surprisingly really strong on the concert side. And we didnât know what we were going to head into an we started renegotiating. But we do know on festivals refund rates are much higher because itâs a bigger cash outlet, but itâs also just a bigger time commitment. They donât tend to be as local as your average concert. So wanted to make sure going to 2021, if you are a headline artist that was going to play a certain festival this year and we wanted -- and you still wanted to play it next year, the two things we wanted to make sure that we were protected in and that we both shared some of the risk was a refund reduction and insurance. Those are the two principles, if you take all the drama from the press, aside those are the two things we wanted to make sure that we werenât stuck paying the same price in 2020 if we had a 31% refund rate on a festival. Now if those tickets all sold back through and that festival ended up at the same place it was in 2020 then we should all share the upside. And every agent and artist and manager have been incredibly accommodating to all the promotors in the business who are all looking for some help in terms of rescheduling next yearâs shows and taking in refund and insurance, and making sure we are clear on those two terms. So that was the net result of it all. The rest was a wish list of things as we head into any negotiation. Weâd all like to win, but those are the two points that made sense that were most important for our business and for the festival P&Ls.
Brandon Ross: What about for shows that are in 2021 that were not pushed from 2020? Are those contracts being structured differently than historical deals?
Michael Rapino: Well, I would say that what the industry did in general overall is every show you basically had you had the chance to cancel it. Right. Every show basically was canceled in some sense. Not to our doing. So everyone was in the same boat. You were all starting with a clean slate. So I would say to you if you had a tour that was on sale and it wasnât doing well, you and the artist decided to pull it down and not go forward with it regardless of COVID. So any tour that you reschedule, you have the opportunity to look at that deal and at that show and at the number of dates, et cetera, and negotiate with the agent and manager and the artist on what was the best go-forward strategy. So anything -- we talk about 2021 is going to be a spectacular year in the sense of the stuff that did get pushed you can guarantee was all of the stuff that was selling well and high demand. So that stuff is all going to -- those shows will still be continuing next year. We didnât have anything really on sale for 2021 ahead of our 2020 season of any substance. Ninety-five percent of what we are dealing with was 2020 reschedule to 2021 shows.
Brandon Ross: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. When you look at planned 2021 concert season, can you talk about how it might look coming back in terms of venues? And you all mentioned before, focus on maybe the amphitheater footprint initially, so how much can you lean into your amphs? And can you book artists there that might otherwise played an arena or stadium?
Michael Rapino: Iâll start and then Joe will jump in. I mean, first, you think about our business. Itâs 50% international, 50% America, so a lot of what weâre doing is what were going to happen outside of America versus here. The summer season in international is the heartbeat of their business festivals, from small outdoor shows to larger festivals. So Europe will already continue what they do well. Most of their business will be outdoors. The summer season here, we do have the advantage of our 50 amphitheaters and we think those are going to be high utilization next summer, as well as our boutique festivals. So, yes, we would be looking right now at the business as a strong amphitheater festival outdoor business in Europe and into America, and then most of your touring indoor stuff will start to ramp up in the fall into winter.
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, I agree. The only thing Iâd add is I think this is a place where our having, our managing a large number of buildings really is going to come to our advantage. So the fact that we have these 50 amphitheaters we can manage the process with the buildings and we have all of that activity outdoor, the same for the festivals where we have the leases on the land and we can operate them. And then even the hundred plus clubs and theaters that we have as one would expect that some of the lower volume number of people gathering will happen sooner than some of the large gathering indoor because we have those buildings, because we can manage the processes with them. I think that will let us ramp up faster than otherwise we would be able to.
David Karnovsky: Okay. Then I think earlier you did mention some international regions with concerts being done at limited capacity. I mean, are there other countries or markets where you operate where you think you can get to some level of scale prior to summer 2021 at this point?
Joe Berchtold: Yeah, I mean, we definitely, we all see that news, the U.S. looks like the one that will be the longest but the other markets, whether itâs Australia, New Zealand, Denmark Germany, Finland, some of those markets, they all seem to be moving along on a good forward path. Theyâve had a very structured plan in place and when small shows can start, they seem to be moving towards those timelines. So although weâre talking about a spring return to business outdoors we do actually operate in 40 different countries expect certain markets especially from theater up unto clubs and into arenas to be happening in some of those markets before the spring.
David Karnovsky: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Ben Swinburne: Hey. Good evening or good afternoon. Michael, can you go a little bit more about artist appetite to get back on the road in this environment? I know a lot are either postponing releasing new music or at least some have. Others, Iâm sure, are trying to be sensitive to the economic pressures that their fans are seeing. What are you hearing from artists that you have relations with around getting back on the road sooner rather than later? And maybe a similar question for you on their, decision process on canceling versus postponing, I think there been some who have decided to cancel in order to help their fans get their money back faster. I didnât know if that was something that you thought would grow as the year progressed. And then I just had a follow up on the deferred revenue point.
Michael Rapino: Yeah, I think it was our last earnings call we were showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change. There was a debate back then whether fans would gather when they got out of this. I think if anything we learned in three months, we got to figure out how they donât gather short-term so we can have better business faster. I would just say to you that we have been really, really, weâre going to play long on this one, so we have artists with lots of ideas on shows they could do now. We wonât be doing DJ sets in The Hamptons anytime soon. Weâre going to play along and play safe. So the artist, you nailed it. I was talking to an artist this morning. I think as you read elsewhere, I think youâre going to see a creative boom. I saw the record label this week also down slightly because they need new releases and touring to happen to keep the machine moving. So yeah, I think 2021 you have artists that are all just keep calling me daily saying, when can I go? Whenâs it going to be safe? When are we going to go? I am dying to go. I got new music. I want to drop new music. So I think this is why we believe long-term regardless of what quarter we exactly scale at, the business will be stronger than ever with the creative push by all these artists who need to get on the road to drive their new music. So 2021, 2022, we can debate what quarter exactly ramps but we believe 2021 into 2022 will be record years with artists on the road who are pent-up. They need to get on the road economically and theyâre now powered by crates of backlog and they are all waiting. I talked to an artist this morning. They were going to release in November. Theyâre going to wait until March now so they can coincide with the tour schedule later in the year in 2021. So huge demand. We are very gifted in this industry and that we have incredible supply chain, a lot of ongoing creative geniuses who make their living connecting with fans on the road. So that will continue, and we know now from all of the craziness we have seen across America, the fans are going to gather. We just got to make sure we can do it safely. As far as canceling and postponing, one of the things we decided really early on was to make sure that we offered refunds on postponed events also. We didnât want deferred revenue to have any false narrative to it. We still are leading the industry. There are many companies that are not giving refunds, even ones that got government money. But we believe that you need to offer the fans refunds for postponed and cancel shows, and weâve done that. So we believe our actual number when we talk about fans holding on, itâs real. We make it very easy for you to get a refund right now at Ticketmaster if you go look at our site versus others. We even see a concerts sold at Ticketmaster versus other ticket sites, the take rate is higher at Ticketmaster, because itâs very easy to get a refund. I believe that the refund numbers are true, theyâre not suppressed in any manner on our business because weâre offering both options. And if you see an artist that canceled versus postponed, it wouldnât be because he wants his fan to get money back. Weâve offered both those options for any tour. It may just be an artist that wasnât going to go, was going to go on the road, probably an older artist looking at it saying, maybe Iâm not going to run back and try to figure out if May is going to happen right now; Iâll take a year off. So youâve seen some of those ones that theyâve said, Iâll just wait. If youâre a younger artist tied to more record releases, youâre probably really still waiting and ready to go probably a little earlier, given your demo.
Ben Swinburne: Got it. Thatâs helpful. And then just deferred on the revenue. Thank you for all the detail. I may be confused. Deferred revenue for events, I think, at the end of the quarter was about $940 million. And I think you said you thought it would be $1.3 billion at the end of the year. Itâs obviously the higher number, which is sort of counterintuitive, given there is some refund activity expected. I think, Joe, you said that did not include any benefit from on sales. So whatâs the reconciling item? Or did I just maybe mishear you?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. So you heard the numbers right, Ben. Two things. One is, as part of that $941 million, that includes $180 million of what weâve modeled out as additional refunds that we expect to happen. Because we are able to model it, we needed to ship that out of deferred revenue. If our model were perfect, then that wouldâve already been taken out. And the second is when we use the term deferred revenue, it is with regards to deferred revenue for events taking place over the next 12 months. Thatâs never been an important nuance in the past because deferred revenue for things over a year ago has tended to be pretty small. But in this case, because we deferred a lot of shows into the second half of 2021, we have about $400 million of long-term deferred revenue that will flip into deferred revenue over the next six months. So your 900 plus 400 equals the $1.3 billion rough numbers.
Ben Swinburne: Got it. Weâll all be experts on this by the end of the year hopefully. Thanks for your help.
Joe Berchtold: And then weâll start selling more tickets to confuse you deferred. We look forward to that day.
Ben Swinburne: Thanks.
Operator:  And you do have a question in queue from Khoa Ngo with Jeffries.
Khoa Ngo: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. If you can just focus a little bit on M&A opportunities, and obviously, thereâs a lot of distress out there. So I want to be sensitive and cognizant with the question. So Iâm just wondering what youâre seeing in terms of opportunities to consolidate and what your general appetite is to pursue those opportunities.
Michael Rapino: Well, I think we mentioned it last time. I think we look on a global basis as we continue to look to build our global market share. And we believe that over the next 24 months thereâll be ongoing opportunities for us to expand our global footprints in foreign and international markets that weâve have been looking to get into and build some businesses around. So, yes, we do think that over time this will provide us some opportunity in international markets.
Khoa Ngo: Understood. And if I can just pivot a little bit towards your cost cuts. Youâve clearly made a lot of progress. I believe the numbers were around $500 million pre-1Q, and then 1Q was about $600 million and now youâre at $800 million. Iâm just wondering of that $800 million how much of that you think is more structural, more permanent going forward.
Michael Rapino: Yeah, I donât think weâre going to give you exact number. But thereâs no question weâve been going through this process, weâve been looking at our fundamental cost structure and we do expect that we will come out of this with some different organizational structures, a bit leaner, bit tighter in terms of how we do some things. So we will have some savings. How much of that, right, you expect to see more of that in 2021 is a year that youâre ramping back up; and then as your continuing to grow getting into 2022 and beyond, youâre then reinvesting some portion of that. But over the next quarter or two, weâll give more definitive numbers on that.
Khoa Ngo: Understood. Thanks very much.
Michael Rapino: But to give you color, I would add the only gift to when you slow down to this level that you have not had since we launched this company 15 years ago is you build up your own bureaucracy and your own rust 15 years in. And we havenât had the luxuries or opportunity to sit back division by division and look under every rock and challenge ourselves on how are we going to go to market differently? What are some new products we need to go to market with, and how are going to operate more efficiently on a global basis? So I would say the part that does motivate me daily is Joe and I and our teams probably have never felt so energized around what Live Nation 3.0 will look like heading into 2021. And thatâs -- our main obsession isnât just to sit still but to come out of this looking and feeling different.
Khoa Ngo: Thanks very much for the color
Michael Rapino: Will hit -- which obviously will add efficiencies to our ongoing cost structure as well.
Operator: Your final question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen.
Stephen Glagola: Hi. If we look at the phase 3 openings across the U.S. and internationally, concerts that are still being put on in various international countries and cities for the most part are at pretty reduced capacities. What gives you confidence that the governments will allow live events to return to scale in the summer of 2021? And can you maybe define like when you say back to scale, is that 75% capacity, 50% capacity in your amsen  festivals or full capacity, if thatâs the expectation. That would be great. And then you talk on the press release like the potential revenue opportunity or -- sorry -- streaming, excuse me -- as being an additional long-term component of the concert business. Could you maybe speak to that as a potential additional new revenue opportunity? And any other adjacent products or services you guys may be able to offer during this difficult time to bring in some incremental revenue? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: All right. Let me -- go ahead.
Joe Berchtold: I will start on streaming then work backwards. Yeah. I think we have a natural advantage in the streaming business in the sense we have studios call these events. And 300 festivals and 10,000 theater and club shows alone, weâve been great at the physical execution but they do provide incredible digital opportunities that we havenât focused enough on. So I think weâre deep at work in biz devev  department and I think youâll see some new products from us in the new year that we think are complements to our core business. But great additions. We also have such a huge sponsorship base, when you have 900 sponsors. Adding Live from Home alone has been a big part of helping deliver some benchmarks as well as drive-in concerts and some of the reduced capacity, although not perfect on their own, theyâve been great tools to provide sponsors with some value. So I think youâre right. Youâre going to see us launch some new products that we think will be a great complement to our core business. As far as the confidence on getting back to business, Joe, you and I were just discussing that so you could take the lead.
Joe Berchtold: Sure. So first of all, to answer your question on what we mean by scale? To us, scale our normal business model in the summer, weâd be doing several thousand concerts a quarter for tens of millions of fans. So weâre not going to try to predict right now the exactness. Is it 70%? Is it 90%? What percent of last year is it? But itâs in that type of volume. So why do we think itâs going to happen? A couple of things. First of all, I think the efforts on the vaccine front are moving faster than anyone predicted three or four months ago if you listen to the experts. The Dr. Faucis of the world and what are they saying in terms of their expectations where you have multiple different vaccines with multiple different approaches and their belief that something is going to happen by the end of the year is one of the vectors that gives you some comfort. The other is the progress being made on the treatments. Weâve obviously as a medical community learned a huge amount over the past four months in terms of the basic treatment, in terms of perhaps the potential of antibody treatments, the use of other drugs, remdesivir and others, in terms of helping to reduce the mortality rate of it. So overall in terms of as weâve talked bringing about the facts and the science lead us, we have been pleasantly surprised thus far on the progress of vaccines, probably some of the testing and tracing has been slower but still now is ramping up so between the testing, tracing, the treatment also providing opportunity. So amongst those I think we believe sitting here today that the facts would say that by the beginning of the year youâre able to put on the tickets. The tickets on sale weâll be able to do the shows next summer. And then for the reasons that we have talked about, we have a high degree of comfort that demand is going to be there. 86% of the people keeping their tickets to the shows, two-thirds of the people keeping their tickets for festivals that were canceled this year, put out canceled but still saying they wanted to go to the show next year instead of getting their refund. So in total over 19 million tickets for 4,000 shows that have already been sold which that alone, well, we have already sold for 2021 would make us one of the largest promoters in the world. So all those factors together I think is what gives us the comfort.
Stephen Glagola: Thanks, John and Michael, and pardon the long-winded questions, but if I could just slip one more and just on, could you discuss the viability of independent venue owners in this environment if then used to close down or go bankrupt? How do you anticipate that impacting the concerts business and also Ticketmaster you think will reopen?
Michael Rapino: I would just say on the Ticketmaster front, itâs a global business with a very, very diverse portfolio less on the small venue side on a macro level. So it would have limited effect there. Ticketmaster, at the end of the day has very large sports business on a global basis and big venues which is a big part of its business and then large concerts. So donât think youâll see it there, any effect there. I would say that looks like in most of the countries, maybe the U.S. now, this ongoing stimulus programs in effect and that seem to be coming to life for the live business in general, whether itâs the employees, whether itâs the venues, small or big. So I would assume some of them would have continued ongoing support through government programs to keep them afloat through this time. Listen, we are all in the same boat. We are all looking to figure out how to get through the downtime and reduce costs, and I think they are banding together, and hopefully, they will find their support systems also.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. 
Michael Rapino: Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. My name is Christina, and I will be your conference operator on today's call. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release, reconciliation and other financial statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at investors.livenationentertainment.com.It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I hope that everyone out there is healthy and safe. On our last call, we were on track for tremendous growth across all our businesses, with both fan demand and artists touring increasing on a global basis. Then in mid-March, we came to a halt. We have held no concerts in almost 2 months. Despite these challenging times, we continue to have full confidence in the long-term supply and demand of the live concert industry, Live Nation's leadership position and our business model's ability to successfully deliver AOI growth and shareholder value. With that context, let me update you on our top priorities at this point.Our top priority is to ensure the health and safety of our employees, fans and artists. Like most of the world, we have been working remotely since mid-March, and we will return to work only after there is clear consensus that it is safe to do so, and then in appropriate numbers with expanding cleaning and social distancing protocols. Similarly, we recognize the experience that our venues will change when concerts start back up. And we're working with medical experts and public health officials on procedures to keep people safe while enjoying our shows.When we asked over 8,000 fans across North America about the requirements for returning to shows, they had 2 clear priorities, with 85% of fans stating they want increased cleaning and sanitizing of the venues and ready access to hand sanitizing stations, while no other action received more than 40%. In addition, we expect to have additional safety protocols in place, potentially including reduced capacity, touchless concessions and creative ways to apply our digital ticketing technology.Our next priority is planning for the reopening of concerts when the time is right. First and foremost, we will let the facts and science tell us when we should start putting on concerts again. We are working with government at federal and state levels in the U.S. and across all markets in building plans that fit with their reopening phases. In the meantime, we have fortified our balance sheet to have the resources to ramp up quickly when the time is right.We know from fans that demand will be there when the shows return. Globally, over 90% of fans are holding on to their tickets for rescheduled shows when refunds are available. That's the clearest demonstration of pent-up demand that will enable us to quickly start concerts back up.Looking a bit farther out, given that 80% of shows are rescheduled rather than canceled, and as noted, almost all fans are holding on to their tickets, we believe 2021 can return to show volume and fan attendance at levels consistent with what we've seen in recent years.As we plan the resumption of concerts, we're also seeing a number of innovations within our company as artists look to stay connected to fans. Almost 1 million fans have come to our Live at Home site to find virtual tours and acoustic performances from their home. And millions of fans in over 100 different countries have joined Insomniac's Virtual Rave-a-Thons, while drive-in concerts are finding a new purpose to socially-distant concert halls. Throughout all this, we are still motivated by the long-term potential of global live events. It's in the DNA of us to want to gather, socialize and celebrate. And as we provide assurances on health and safety at the venue, we expect our business to build back.Live Nation is in the best position in the live ecosystem to play long and to capture new opportunities, continue leading the industry into the future. I'll now hand the call over to Kathy and Joe, who will provide additional full details on our balance sheet.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year. And we've surpassed that goal and are now targeting $600 million in cost reductions. We've also expanded our cash management program, which including our cost initiatives, now eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash requirements this year. As a result, we project our monthly operational cost burn rate to be approximately $150 million per month for the second quarter and through the remainder of the year.Now I will walk through the impact of the COVID shutdown on each of our businesses during the first quarter. As we previously indicated, at the end of February, we were headed toward delivering Q1 AOI, in line with last year, approximately $115 million. Instead, with the shutdown, we had 100 -- sorry, instead, with the shutdown, we had a $21 million AOI loss for the quarter. The direct COVID impact in the quarter was approximately $165 million, which was partially offset by approximately $30 million in cost savings during the quarter.Starting with concerts. Our concerts division went from $5 million of AOI in the first quarter of last year to a loss of $88 million this year. Through February, we had promoted 5,500 shows for nearly 8 million fans, up year-on-year by 17% and 2%, respectively. We then ended the quarter with 7,100 shows for 10.4 million fans, down 14% and 30%, respectively, from last year. With 2,100 March shows canceled or rescheduled to a future date, we've lost approximately $40 million of anticipated contribution margin on those shows. Additionally, we had a onetime expense of approximately $25 million for sunk cost for canceled shows, which included the cost of paying show employees for those shows that didn't happen during the second half of March. We had always expected our concerts AOI to be down in Q1 given the show activity level and increased fixed costs of approximately $40 million largely associated with acquisitions made over the last year. But unfortunately, the March shutdown led to a substantially lower AOI.On a separate matter, our OCESA acquisition was approved by Mexico's regulators in April. We've now entered into discussions with CIE and Televisa regarding the timing and terms of the previously announced OCESA transaction. And do not expect to close the transaction until we have greater clarity on the duration of the shutdown in Mexico and its impact on OCESA's business.Next, Ticketmaster. Our ticketing division AOI fell from $100 million in the first quarter last year to $45 million this year. Similar to our concerts division, through February, we were on track for a strong Q1 with fee-bearing GTV up 31% to $3.2 billion. Net of refunds, we then ended the quarter with $3.0 billion in fee-bearing GTV, down 22% from Q1 last year. This drastic reduction in fee-bearing GTV led to an approximately $65 million reduction in contribution margin relative to our February forecast for the business. In addition, we refunded 5.2 million tickets for $432 million of GTV during March. And along with an accrual for future refunds of shows canceled in April, this resulted in a $35 million reduction in contribution margin.To give you a little more color on our refunds through this past weekend, Ticketmaster has had 65,000 shows impacted by the virus. Virtually all canceled shows are currently refunding, and about 80% of rescheduled shows or postponed shows are currently offering refunds. For Live Nation concerts, about 9,000 shows have been impacted. Of those shows, about 20% have canceled and 80% are rescheduling. Again, almost all canceled shows are currently refunding. And over 90% of rescheduled shows are offering refunds with the remaining shows scheduled to be refunding in the near future. And as Michael said, less than 10% of fans are taking the refund for the rescheduled or postponed shows when given the choice with over 90% of them holding on to their tickets for a future date.Finally, sponsorship. Our sponsorship business was the least impacted by the March shutdown, losing less than $5 million in contribution margin as a result, and this quarter delivered $47 million in AOI, up from $40 million in the first quarter last year.Overall, we recognize the next few quarters will not be business as usual, so we won't be giving any direction on key operating metrics until we start selling tickets and promoting concerts again. Our focus is on managing our cost structure and cash burn, ensuring a strong balance sheet as we come out of the shutdown. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy.
Elizabeth Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon to everyone joining us. I will briefly recap our first quarter results and provide an update on our liquidity position. For the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue, down 21% compared to last year as the shutdown shows due to COVID-19 reduced our revenue by approximately $435 million, primarily in concerts and also ticketing. Our AOI was a loss of $21 million for the quarter, down $136 million compared to last year driven by approximately $165 million in COVID-related impacts.Our operating loss was $173 million, driven by an estimated $175 million COVID-19 impacts, including $10 million in intangible impairments in the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $185 million, and net loss per share was $0.94.Now on to our balance sheet and liquidity position. We are actively managing our cash to preserve our strong liquidity position during the stoppage in shows. We have taken quick and aggressive actions to conserve cash, including our cost savings initiatives and cash management program, which eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash outflows for 2020 relative to our budget as Joe outlined. In addition to the $600 million in cost savings, these cash impacts include a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and deferrals of concert and ticketing advances. We now estimate an operational cash burn rate of approximately $150 million per month for the rest of the year, prior to interest expense, debt payments, capital expenditures and other nonoperational items.As of March 31, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $817 million. In April, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which suspends our net leverage covenant for the second and third quarters of 2020, replaced with a minimum liquidity test for those quarters. Beginning in Q4 of this year, the net leverage covenant will use the bank-defined EBITDA from Q2 and Q3 of 2019 instead of the Q2 and Q3 2020 results. We continue to have a 20% add-back in that EBITDA calculation, which gives us added protection from our COVID-19 impacts during the period. We also added an incremental revolver of $130 million in April, providing us with additional financial and operational flexibility. That now gives us $963 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. And we will continue to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to expand liquidity at appropriate pricing.Our total cash includes $2 billion of event-related deferred revenue as of March 31. This is part of our operating cash and therefore, provides us additional liquidity. We believe that our free cash balance of $817 million, together with our $963 million of undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations for the remainder of the year, even in the extreme scenario that no major shows play off this year.As of the end of the quarter, our total net debt position was $3.7 billion, with a weighted average cost of 3.9%. We expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants around our corporate debt structure for all of 2020. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million. We are now estimating our full year CapEx to be approximately $200 million, down from our initial estimate at the beginning of the year of $375 million as part of our overall cash flow improvement process. Of the remaining $126 million in CapEx for the year, approximately $50 million is for capitalized labor in our ticketing segment, which we continue to rely on for our ticketing operations, with the remainder largely venue-related long-term projects. We will continue to evaluate all projects as the year progresses, particularly as we gain more insight into opening time lines by region.With that, we'll open it up to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky: First, Michael, I'd be interested to get your view on the long-term impact of COVID-19. Across a lot of industries right now, there's talk of huge acceleration in consumer trends. So I'm wondering what you think this potentially means for the concerts and ticketing industry.
Michael Rapino: Thanks, David. We're looking at all this data ongoing as we're trying to understand and make sure we're looking at a global basis of our consumers and any long-term effects. It was important, we want to make sure we got one of our surveys online today because I think the general surveys aren't always useful, but we went and talk to 10,000 of casual and ongoing ticket buyers around the world. And the data's pretty compelling. I mean 90% of fans are saying, "I can't wait to get back to the show." I think our refund rate says everything. Anyone that has any view that says, will they come back? Will the consumer change behavior? We're running somewhere between a 5% and 10% refund rate right now on a global basis, much lower in Europe.Those aren't out of line with when we reschedule just a traditional tour for different reasons. So 90% of fans in today's environment saying, "I'm going to hold on to those tickets because I can't wait to see the show," I think it's probably the most compelling data one could look at that says the consumer is going to come back strong. It's a big part of their old social DNA to get out and gather and communal experiences with their friends and family.So we don't debate that consumers nor artists will be back on the road from a supply/demand -- I mean, since the early days, people have been gathering around artists. And we think long after we're dead, people will gather around artists. It's a communal primal need. We're just not debating on what month we start that back. So we don't think we have any consumer trends that worry us. This -- there was no acceleration in our industry of a decline. If anything, we were having a global acceleration as emerging markets were becoming more sophisticated and opening up to the traditional concert. So we see that on a global basis that the show will be back. It'll be back as big as ever from a consumer demand.And the second part of our equation that is really unique is the supply. We have all these artists who really look to go on the road for financial and to bond with their fans and build long-term franchises. And talking to those artists on a daily basis, they are waiting to get back on the road when it's safe for them and their fans. So supply/demand dynamics, I think we have a unique situation in the sense of fans are -- cherish those 2 hours when they get on the road and see their favorite performers. The artists want to get back out. Now we're just going to make sure we play the science, and when can we get out there on a safe manner on a scale basis. But we think demand in '21 and onward will be as big as it was in '20 -- or in '19.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And I was hoping you could expand a bit on your liquidity position. In a scenario of extended shutdowns, how long can you continue to operate? And what options do you see in terms of additional financing? And maybe as a follow-on to that, what is the right way for investors to view your available cash position, including the deferred revenue portion?
Michael Rapino: Joe?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. Sure. David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash, $900-and-something million in untapped debt. So $1.7 billion of available untapped liquidity to start with, and then to the point I made of about $150 million a month of operational cash burn. So that says you can go through this year without doing shows at any scale without any concern. I think it's our expectation that even though likely to not have a huge volume of shows this year, as we get into Q4, you start having the ticket sales in some large scale for shows next year.I think we're already seeing -- obviously, the NFL has their schedule announced today or schedule release today. Most of the teams are going on sale with their tickets over the next day or so. So you're already seeing people going on sale even if the shows aren't happening, and that will drive some of our ticketing and sponsorship businesses. But just as the base case, certainly, getting through this year without any additional liquidity isn't a concern. More broadly, when we look at the markets, I think spreads have come back to more normal levels. The capital markets are absolutely open. Open to us, open to a wide range of folks that are looking for any increased liquidity. We'll watch that opportunistically and see what makes sense to do.And then in terms of your question on deferred revenue, I think that, to us, has never historically been part of how we think about our ongoing operational liquidity. I think in this instance, particularly given the very low level of refunds, as Michael went into, it's just some float that in effect we could tap into if, for short- to medium-term purposes, we had a need for that additional liquidity float. It's not part of our base case scenarios in any means.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin Swinburne: Thanks for all the color on the cash front. Two questions. Michael, could you talk about the sort of operational approach and process of sort of rescheduling all of these events around the world? I mean the complexity, I think, you've talked about in the press is significant. But I'm wondering as you start to go down that path, if you could just spend a few minutes on sort of how you go about doing that and what your opportunities and options are, and how you may or may not be working with other promoters and artists and things along those lines.And then just another cash question on the liability side. You guys have some accrued expenses and accounts payable at the end of the quarter. And I didn't know what we should be thinking about those liabilities, whether or not you need to pay those down over the next couple of quarters. Is there any color you can give us on the accrued expense account payable front? I don't think that's captured in your cash burn number, but I could have that wrong.
Michael Rapino: Thank you. Yes, you're right. We have a lot of shows. I mean again, the glass half full here. Thankfully, our show is not time-dependent. So you feel for any other event companies where if you missed the final 4, you can't replay that. So the great advantage we have is it's just now timing. The fan wants to see Billie Eilish. They would have liked to see them in March, but they'll wait until October or they'll wait until February. The average customer goes to 2.5 shows a year. So these are the Kodak moments, and they'll wait for them.So you're right. We're going to -- we're dealing right now as an industry, as a whole, I'd say, like most probably industries. The industry has never come together this well from the agents, the artists, the buildings, the managers, the promoters, we're all in the same boat. So we're all looking to say, how do we move availabilities. Really, the only challenge we've had with availabilities in terms of a little bit of the -- why we had to hang on to the refund strategy is the sports lakes. They're kind of the ones -- we need to understand what's going to happen in the fall time in their arenas, and what availability is and when is the season going to start. Traditionally, the NFL, and the NBA, NHL announce their season, and then we kind of know the next Q4, Q1, Q2 availabilities. That would really be our only gating issue. As soon as they get their exact schedules up, then we'll be able to slot all the dates in.As an industry, we have a great model right now that if you have a current date that was planned, you will get first holds to get that back on the road. And if you're a new tour that was going to tour in '21, you're probably moving that to later in '21 or into '22. So we've talked about it. We think we'll have a very robust '21 backend and really, really robust backend '21, '22. But working together with the industry, we see no issues in moving all of these dates into '21, just waiting on some scheduling conflicts.
Elizabeth Willard: And on the accrued liability AP part of that question, I mean, think about, yes, it's obviously built into cash burn. It's also part of when you think about what we're deferring, when we talk about deferring part of our cash, the $1 billion. There will be liabilities that will be sitting there that are accrued that just won't be paid for a while.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.
Brandon Ross: First, curious how COVID's impacting your commercial agreements with the artists and venues. In the process of rescheduling all these shows, have you been able to renegotiate the contract terms with the artists on guarantees? And as you look to incremental 2021 tours, do the terms of the artist deals look different because of COVID? Are there less guarantees? And then also, what about third-party venues? And then I have a follow-up.
Michael Rapino: Thanks, Brandon. As I referred to, as an industry, it's been a unique time where we are all in this together. And I would say that the artists, the agents, the managers have been incredibly supportive. The reality that in '20 and '21, the promoter can't take all the risk on the business as we historically have. We need to share some of that, especially refunds on the guarantees. So I would say to you that we don't want to out loud get into how and what the deals are. I would say to you though that we absolutely are getting great latitude from the artists and agents to look at a traditional business of high guarantees and all of our risk, to help share that risk into '20 and 21, to get the shows back on the road and help us absorb the show, but not take all of the refund sales, sponsorship, food and beverage unknowns for the next 6 to 12 months. They're helping sharing some of that risk which will provide us great opportunity to get back, scale fast, but not have to worry about losing money on the show.
Brandon Ross: Great. And you've obviously spent a lot of time looking at your costs searching for near-term savings, but is there an opportunity to reassess your overall cost structure as we come out of the pandemic.
Michael Rapino: Yes, I think any CEO, any business operator, it's the great gift of this reality we're in. We're all looking at our business and wondering, now that we have been able to stop, catch our breath and look at our business, are we running the most efficient way we can? How do we restructure our business, our cost basis on a global basis to be more efficient? We have gone into furloughs and cost reductions, as you know. We absolutely plan on coming out of this a leaner machine, much more efficient on how we go to market.And then probably as other companies have learned, there are some areas we're going to have to spend and acquire a better skill set at, to help us diversify our core business in terms of virtual concerts and other things that we've dabbled in, but maybe we got to spend a bit more time in that area. So bottom line is we look at this as a great opportunity on a global basis for us to restructure our cost basis, come out a leaner organization while still as aggressive as ever in terms of our global growth strategy.
Brandon Ross: Great. And then maybe one just more technical one for Kathy. You said you expect your debt covenants to be fine all year. If I sit back here and I do the math with limited or no revenue in Q4, it looks to me like -- if we used AOI as a proxy for bank EBITDA, you would still bust the covenant in Q4. Can you just explain what we're missing, maybe it's the 20% add-back that you mentioned earlier?
Elizabeth Willard: Yes. I think the two main things, Brandon, would be, yes, you're assuming no material concert activity. But as Joe said, still expecting some ticket sale activity this year and related sponsorship for that. So based on those things, we obviously will not break our covenants based on projections. But I think the other big thing is that 20% because you can take 20% of that bank EBITDA as an add-back for the COVID impacts. And so you can do that for your AOI in the same way and get pretty close.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs.
Andrew Borst: A couple of questions. I want to ask firstly about OCESA. I heard the comments about it but I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on there in terms of -- are you still interested in the asset? Or is this about figuring out a new purchase price, maybe because the performance says they've underperformed in this environment? But maybe you could just add some color on that, please.
Michael Rapino: Yes. We're going to -- we've had a long relationship with OCESA and a great relationship helping them on the tour business as they build their business. And we have talked to them about it in the last couple of weeks. It's taken a while to get the government approvals. It happens -- and now in Mexico. But we were -- as you would expect, my line to them has been, we are, long term, still bullish on their business and ours. We want to be in business with OCESA and get the deal done.But we're not sure where Mexico stands. And I'm not looking to take on any losses from Mexico while they're going through their 6 or 8 months of business downturn, will they come up the other side. So ideally, we want to get the deal done. We want to delay the cash payment of the deal until we both know how and when we're on the other side of this crisis. So that's the intent.
Andrew Borst: Makes sense. If I could, a couple more. I go through the 10-K, there is a liability that gets mentioned, this redeemable noncontrolling interest puts. In the K, you guys flagged it, at least at the time you expected it might be $238 million sort of obligation. I was wondering if you could just comment on whether that's still a good estimate or are there ways to maybe defer those payments in this environment.
Michael Rapino: Yes. Joe, you've been working on that.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. Sure. So Drew, some of that we paid in Q1 for some of those puts. And the majority of anything that's still out there that hasn't been paid, we're working to defer out of the year, and that's part of the $1 billion deferral program. So I think you can kind of take all of that together.
Andrew Borst: Okay. And then just sorry, one last one...
Michael Rapino: But I would add to it. The spirit of it, it's been great. As you can imagine, if you're a partner in a festival, and the festival got canceled, and you happen to have a put up in your deal, we're talking to them about let's delay the put for the year because the event didn't happen and we didn't retain the cash. So we've been very cooperative with our partners. And some of them may need the cash for other reasons, but generally, the partnerships have been very accommodating if their event got moved.
Andrew Borst: Okay. And sorry, one last one on -- when I look at your free cash reconciliation, right, from GAAP cash down to free cash, one of the big add-backs is this prepaid expenses, which I think about $450 million at the end of the quarter. I just want to understand what that is because I guess I'm a little bit concerned that, I guess, these are expenses you already paid for events. I don't know what a counterparty is on those and I guess I'm wondering, would it be -- is it feasible to really collect that cash if you need to get it in sort of short order? Or I don't know, can you help me understand what that number is and that risk of collecting?
Elizabeth Willard: Yes. So mainly, that's going to be artist advances. And so the best way to think about that is it's an offset to the deferred revenue. So we -- on that free cash, we're deducting off our event-related deferred revenue. And the add-back basically says we're not going to have to pay the artist part of that money because we've already advanced it to them. So it's a good way to net out what really is deferred revenue that might be going out other than our profit.
Andrew Borst: I see. So you actually have the cash on. I got you. So it's netted against the deferred, you have the cash in your bank account.
Elizabeth Willard: Right.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Khoa Ngo from Jefferies.
Khoa Ngo: It's clear that your data suggests there's a lot of pent-up demand to return to concerts. I'm just wondering if you can provide granular detail as to your reopening strategies, particularly spend engagement, artist engagement, and how you can feasibly control capacity in the social business as well.
Michael Rapino: Thank you. Yes. Well, one of the things I always remind people on 2 fronts is our global diversity is our greatest strength. It always has been. Wherever there's been challenges, there's been markets of opportunity. So the 2 things to remember about our business, unlike sports or NFL where it's stadiums or nothing, is we have a very diverse size of shows. We did 15,000 club and theater shows last year, and we did them in 40 countries. So we'll look in the next 6 months, but we'll be kind of starting slow and small, focusing on the basics, kind of testing regionally. But it will be about whether it's in Arkansas or a state that is safe, secure and politically is fine to proceed in, we're going to dabble in fan-less concerts with broadcast. We're going to go and reduce capacity shows because we can make the math work.There are a lot of great artists that maybe they can sell an arena out, but they'll do 10 higher-end smaller theaters or clubs. We're seeing lots of artists jumping to get back out when it's safe. So you're going to see us in different countries, whether it's Finland, whether it's Asia, Hong Kong, certain markets are farther ahead. And we kind of look at it as over the next -- over the summer period, there'll be testing happening, whether it's some fan-less concerts, which are really important for our sponsorship business, all the ways we can create great properties to keep all of our sponsors who have been amazing and sticking with us this year. So it's important for us to keep doing drive-in concerts. We're going to test and roll out, which we're having some success with, fan-less concerts, which have great broadcast opportunities; reduce capacity of festival concerts where it could be outdoors, could be in a theater, it could be in a large stadium floor, where there's enough room to be safe.So we have all of these plans in place depending on the market and where the -- that local city may sit in their reopening phases. So we want to be smart. We don't want to rush. We're playing long ball. One of the realities is we and AEG are the 2 companies that can withstand this storm as long as it plays. And we're going to play for the long safety of business. So we're not looking to rush and provoke any new spread of the virus. We want to do it smart with local participation. But there's lots of great opportunities that are arising now where we will get to test over the summer period.And again, I remind you, those are important for my sponsorship business as well as testing the feel on some new ideas we have. We think the fall time, if a lot of those things happen and don't cause any second hot spots, that you'll see markets around the world. Europe specifically has talked about September opening up 5,000-plus. So I think you'll see the fall time more experimental and more shows happening in more of a theater setting and into some arenas. And then our goal is really to be on sale in Q3 and 4 for '21 at full scale, and testing all through the summer.I would say on the venue part that's really interesting, and we're dealing with Federal, White House to every government body, you can imagine. We're jumping on all of the best practices with all the sports leagues, the commissioners, the teams. So we've got a great task force around what have we got to do with the venue to make you safe. And I just think it's very interesting from our data, the fan's not looking for instant testing or thermometers, although those would be fabulous, and we hope those come fast in terms of 5-minute testing. 85% of fans want to make sure our venues are sanitized, enhanced sanitizers available. That's the bar they need to say it's safe to show up. It's the most important factors. So that's also important. We're working with the local governments on what is our venue prep plan, what's the protocol to make the fans feel safe, well for testing. So making sure we have proper sanitization, hand sanitizers, masks, physical distance, cashless concessions. So we've got a full plan in place. We think those are smart things for the future.Digital ticketing is something we've always been driving for a bunch of reasons, but no better time than ever to have digital ticketing and cashless concessions, part of our access program, we're going to continue to excel. I think that will be one of the real advantages of this crisis.So we think we're well on plan on a global basis to have our venues ready. Now we're just going to go market-by-market with one of these or multiple ideas as the market's ready to test these. And that's our plan for the summer, to keep the business moving.
Khoa Ngo: Understood. And if I can follow up on that on the pricing side. It does seem like we are moving into a contact-less world going forward. So I'm just wondering, in your latest presentation, you outlined $100 million AOI opportunity. Do you think the current environment allows you to pull that forward in some sort of capacity?
Joe Berchtold: This is Joe. Yes, we absolutely think the presence only becomes more important. I think that the magnitude of the opportunity holistically becomes even larger because I think our leadership in technology and the breadth at which we can apply it, as Michael said, it's not just contact-less entry, but cashless payments and other forms have great potential. I think the exact timing of it is still TBD with just a pause that we have going on right now, and we can get it -- when we can get it deployed. But no question, the opportunity is larger than ever.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. And I will now turn the call back over to Michael for any closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: No. Be safe, and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and – my name is Pillari, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment’s Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded.Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon’s call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company’s anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters.Please refer to Live Nation’s SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company’s most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release reconciliation and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation’s website at investors.livenationentertainment.com.It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 conference call. In 2019, Live Nation delivered its ninth consecutive year of growth, with revenue up 7% and AOI up 14%.Starting with the core of our business, our concerts fan count was up 5 million to 98 million globally, driving AOI growth in all of our divisions, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, demonstrating the effectiveness of our flywheel business model.In our Concerts segment, fans continue to find the live experience, from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and share the experience with other fans. In the U.S., over the past five years consumer spending on live entertainment has grown 7% annually, providing strong structural tailwinds to drive increased demand for concerts globally.With these demand dynamics, in 2019, we delivered growth in concerts revenue of 8% and AOI of 7%. This growth was broad-based across our portfolio, with international fan count up 11%, while in North America, arenas, festivals, theaters & clubs contributed to our growth.Globally, festivals, theaters & club attendance were up double digits, highlighting the strength of our global footprint and the value of a diversified portfolio of markets, genres and building types that have enabled our consistent growth over the past several years. And across all of the artists we work with, we invested well over $6 billion to promote 40,000 shows in 42 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music.Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows are up double digits since 2017, while sales of dynamically-priced Platinum tickets are up 66% for the year across 3,000 shows, as artists want more of the best seats in the house sold at face value at the onsale.Even with these increases, concerts remain a great deal for fans relative to other live experiences. Our average ticket for a concert at any one of our amphitheaters was $46 in 2019, relative to a $75 NBA game over $100 for an NFL game.Once at the show, average per fan spending grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spending grew by $2.50 to over $29 per head, as we improved our product offering, reduced friction with shorter lines, and improved VIP hospitality offerings. The hospitality focus also grew on-site spending at our festivals, theaters & clubs, the result of a better experience for our fans across all our operated venues.We added 38 new venues in 2019, including six new festivals and 18 new theaters & clubs. As we have gotten better at on-site hospitality over the past several years, this opens up more opportunity for us to operate more buildings, where we make more money per fan, which accelerates the on-site monetization part of our flywheel.The strength of our business is continuing with concert tickets sold through mid-February for 2020 shows, up 10% to 38 million, and a pipeline of 4,700 confirmed arena, stadium and amphitheater shows, up 30% from the same time last year. All venue types have strong show count growth, led by North America stadium and arena concerts.In our high-margin sponsorship business, we grew revenue by 17% and AOI by 16% in 2019. Venue sponsorship was a key growth driver in the year, up double digits globally, with broad growth across amphitheaters, festivals, theaters & clubs.Festivals had a particularly strong year. With the addition of Rock in Rio to our portfolio of marquee festivals, sponsorship in this segment was up over 50%. Our top strategic sponsors have also been a key driver of our sponsorship segment, with 88 sponsors collectively spending approximately $400 million to reach our fans, and revenue from this group up 19% in the year.In 2019, we broadened our brand partnership base by leveraging our Power of Live research, with particular success in the lifestyle space working with brands, including Revlon, Vans and Clinique, as we demonstrated the importance of their products to concertgoers.All this reinforces the power of our platform of 98 million fans and the priority of brands to reach fans during the live experience. With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year committed, and despite 2020 being an off year for Rock in Rio in Brazil, we are confident we will deliver continued growth in our sponsorship segment this year.Ticketmaster further built its leadership position in ticketing in 2019, growing AOI by 11%. Most of our growth came through reduced customer acquisition costs across both primary and secondary ticketing and from secondary ticketing volume, notably the NFL and other sporting events.Our international ticketing business drove our growth in fee-bearing tickets and GTV, led by our strong international concerts ticket sales. We now provide services in 31 countries, and in 2019, delivered 115 million tickets internationally, with tremendous opportunity for continued growth on a global basis, particularly in the 15 markets where we promote concerts and don’t yet have a substantial ticketing operation.Ticketmaster’s recent entry into both the Taiwan and Singapore markets highlights this international expansion opportunity, leveraging our leading concerts position in these markets and now growing our ticketing presence to seven countries in Asia, as we continue to build out our flywheel across more of these markets.In North America, our top priority in 2019 was deploying Presence, our secure ticketing digital product, which we see as key in differentiating Ticketmaster and providing venues, teams and artists with the information and tools to maximize their fan relationships. Presence was deployed in over 700 venues by the end of 2019, including over 90% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, operating 50,000 events for over 120 million fans, more than half of whom used digital tickets for entry.We see our deployment in 2020 further accelerating, and we are planning to have Presence in over 1,300 venues by the end of the year, with over 200 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will cover 100% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, and 90% of all fans in North American Ticketmaster venues, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital ticketing.Artist-driven initiatives, such as ticketing Pearl Jam’s entire tour with SafeTix, enabling their strategy of getting tickets into the hands of their greatest fans, is one demonstration of how digital ticketing is serving content more effectively. At the same time, we continue to scale our global ticketing marketplace, with the fourth quarter being our second-highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV.Ticketmaster continues to lead the ticketing industry, both operationally and in digital ticketing. Looking at 2020, I’m confident in Ticketmaster’s ability to extend that leadership position globally, as we add more customers, ticket more events and expand our digital ticketing platform.In summary, 2019 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concerts business and driving growth in our high-margin venue, sponsorship and ticketing businesses.Looking at 2020, our double-digit fan and show count growth so far this year against a backdrop of very high artist activity across all venue types and markets sets up our flywheel to deliver another year of strong global growth.With this, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael indicated, fan attendance grew 5% to 98 million fans, demonstrating the strength of our global portfolio and with this demand growth highlighting the strong fundamentals underlying our business.Geographically, international had a strong year with growth in stadiums, festivals and theaters & clubs, driving 11% fan growth. Theaters & clubs globally led fan growth for the year with 20% growth to nearly 30 million fans. Festivals also had a strong year, with seven new festivals, including Rock in Rio helping deliver 13% fan growth globally.Our fan attendance is up from 47 million in 2010, closing out for decade by more than doubling our fan base, the key milestone that demonstrates the consistent and resilient growth at the core of our flywheel, creating significant scale over time.Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, while attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower, heavily driven by an increase in advertising expense related to 2020 shows, an increased fixed expenses associated with continuing to build our flywheel and operate more venues. Without this higher than projected advertising expense from putting more 2020 shows on sale in 2019, concerts AOI for the year would have been up double digits.Moving on to sponsorship. In 2019, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 16% for the year. International drill over 70% of this growth, with the addition of Rock in Rio helping drive both international and festival sponsorship growth.For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 25% and AOI was up 26%, with growth helped by the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil. Our pipeline for 2020 is in good shape, demonstrating the strength of our concerts, flywheel and driving all parts of the business, and we expect to continue growing our sponsorship AOI, despite not having Rock in Rio Brazil this year.Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was flat in the quarter, matching 2018’s record fourth quarter, while fee-bearing GTV was down 2%. North America fee-bearing GTV was flat for the quarter, while international was down 8%, reflecting the geographic shift in 2020 stadiums versus last year. This volume was up relative to our expectations for the quarter, reflecting both the timing shift and an even stronger 2020 pipeline of concerts than was previously projected.For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 23%, due to a 9% increase in secondary GTV, reduced customer acquisition costs and the benefit from competing against last year’s costs related to a third-party data bridge. These same factors then drove our margin improvement for the quarter.Looking at 2020, we expect the strong concert slate will drive Ticketmaster’s GTV, including the strong Q1, when we will have most of our stadium and arena on sales. A few more points. The coronavirus has had a lot of press lately, so I wanted to give some context for us.First, as it relates to China and Asia shows generally, show cancellations have been minimal, given our activity levels in China, with 17 shows totaling approximately 75,000 fans. Looking over the next three months, our Asia activity is limited with 70 shows and 200,000 fans in the region.Second, as it relates to Italy, we have 30 shows booked over the next three months, with approximately 125,000 fans. Collectively, this accounts for less than one half of 1% of our 100 million-plus fans we expect to attend our shows this year.More broadly, while we expect that there will be further areas of breakout over the next few months, one of our strengths is that we are highly diversified geographically. Thus far, we have seen no pullback in fan demand or ticket buying outside of this specifically affected areas and overall, our attendance is weighted towards the latter part of this year, with our 70% of our attendance expected from June through the end of the year.Finally, on the OCESA acquisition, we continue to make progress working with the regulators in Mexico on their review. And at this point, we expect the acquisition to close sometime in the second quarter.With that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key highlights for the fourth quarter of 2019 are: revenue increased by 11% to $2.9 billion; AOI was $81 million, up 18%; as of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was up 10% to $1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion last year; concerts was the primary driver of revenue growth, as it increased 12% for more fans and shows; sponsorship revenue was up 25%, as we benefited from the second weekend of Rock in Rio Brazil; and ticketing revenue grew 2% as a result of higher secondary ticket volume; AOI was up 18%, driven by growth in sponsorship due to the four days of Rock in Rio and improved resale volume and lower operating cost in ticketing; concerts AOI declined from higher advertising expense for 2020 shows, and increased headcount and rent, primarily related to additional venues.As we’ve noted before, we recognized our show-related advertising for future shows at the end of the year, so the higher volume of on sales for 2020 shows increases our year and expenses.Operating loss for the quarter was $83 million, compared to a loss of $90 million in the prior year as a result of the higher AOI. Net loss for the quarter was $160 million, compared to a net loss of $148 million in the prior year, driven mainly by higher interest, taxes and non-controlling interest expense.For full-year 2019, revenue was $11.5 billion, a 7% increase over 2018. AOI was $943 million, up 14%, and free cash flow adjusted was $499 million, up 4% over last year, representing 53% of AOI due to the timing of distributions to NCI partners.Revenue growth was primarily driven by concerts, which was up 8%, as we saw attendance growth across North America arenas, international stadiums and festivals and theaters & clubs globally. Sponsorship revenue was also strong with 17% growth, driven by Rock in Rio, high demand for our venue on-site sponsorship programs and growth from a number of our strategic sponsors and related spend.All of our segments contributed to our AOI growth. Concerts AOI was up 7%, as we grow our fan base and number of shows across arenas, theaters & clubs and festivals, along with improved fan on-site spend at our amphitheaters, festivals and theaters & clubs. Sponsorship AOI grew by 16%. In ticketing, our largest AOI contributor grew 11%. from higher revenue and lower operating costs.Operating income was $325 million, up 19% over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. Our net income for the full-year was $70 million, compared to $60 million in 2018, due to our improved operating results. Net loss per share was $0.02, after $75 million in accretion of redeemable non-controlling interests. For 2019, we saw a 2% FX impact on both revenue and AOI.Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.5 billion, including $838 million in ticketing client cash and $936 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $697 million.Net cash provided by operating activities was $470 million, compared to $942 million last year, due to the timing of payables and ticket sales versus the prior year. Free cash flow adjusted was $499 million, compared to $481 million last year.Our total capital expenditures were $316 million, 52% of which was spent on revenue-generating items. Our total net debt as of December 2019, after our refinancing in October, was $3.3 billion, with a weighted average cost of 4.2%.Our current expectations for 2020 include: in concerts, we expect most of the AOI growth to come in Q3, with some in Q2 and our seasonally quieter Q1, having a bit less activity than last year. In sponsorship, while we expect growth for the year, the Rock in Rio Brazil, biennial Festival will not occur in 2020.In ticketing, we currently expect this strong concerts slate to drive growth in GTV with higher on-sale activity, particularly in Q1. It is too early in the year for us to predict FX impact for 2020. We will provide guidance in future calls as the year developed. All of our guidance is currently in a constant currency to 2019.We expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with the increase largely driven by revenue-generating expenditures. And we currently expect accretion of non-controlling interests to be approximately $55 million for 2020, with about half done in the first quarter and the rest fairly evenly distributed across the remaining quarters.Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.
Brandon Ross: Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Mike may as well address the elephant in the room right off the bat with corona. And you gave us some really good color on Italy and Asia. Thanks for that. But I think investors want to understand the potential downside risk if there are broader show cancellations, especially over the summer period.To the extent that an individual show is canceled, can you help us understand what the financial impact would be? I know you guys buy many tours outright. I think, you pay artists, like $8 billion per year. Are you left holding the bag if shows are cancelled? And then if there are regions that are affected by corona, do you have the flexibility to reroute tours?And finally, you gave really strong leading indicators for 2020, obviously, shaping up to be a big year without corona. If there is major corona impact, would you anticipate that activity pushing out to 2021? I think that covers most of it.
Joe Berchtold: Sure, Brandon, this is Joe. I’ll get started and Michael can jump in. I think the first thing just to put in the right context is your latter point, anything that is being talked about is generally being talked about just in terms of timing, it’s not being talked about not doing the shows, as we’ve long discussed, artists see the touring is the fundamental part of what they do and how they earn their living.So there, we’re not talking any artists. They’re saying they don’t want to be touring. It’s all exactly where can I go when? So it’s just talking about timing. Absolutely, as we look at very specific hotspot, there is certainly flexibility to reroute as need be or to have them come back and hit that area later, as opposed to when was previously planned.In general, we pay the artist when the show occurs. There’s generally force majeure clauses. If for some reason a show were to be canceled, we wouldn’t have to pay the artist. But, again, we think that that’s going to be pretty limited, where we don’t have some ability to either reroute or reschedule.
Michael Rapino: And Brandon, a little color on the cancel and the cost. So there will be no cost. We don’t pay an artist until they play. If an artist says, if we cancel a show next month in Milan, we don’t pay the artist. There’s no cost incurred. And when the artist replace that show, then we pay the artist.So these ones are actually the easier ones to manage. I mean, the ones that you always have the more challenges when the festival gets canceled on the Saturday afternoon when 60,000 people are sitting there. That’s when you have a – some marketing and some sunk costs, where it may affect you.When you have a month, two month, anytime you cancel in advance, there’s actually no cost incurred yet, the artist isn’t at the show, the people aren’t in the venue, you haven’t paid the cost. So this is – the easiest economic challenge for us is to reroute and reschedule a show no cost to us.As Joe said, the good news is on a supply demand, the show is not going away, it’s just moving to a different quarter. The artist will tour whether they have to jump off this quarter and go in the fall, or 2021, we won’t net lose the business.And the other demand part that we’re just really impressed with, because we always talk about the resilience of the concert fan is, as of last night, we had a sellout in Australia on a festival that went up. The business is real strong. The consumer still seems to be buying the tickets on a global basis.So supply demand will be there. We’re going to take this cautiously as we watch the markets and we assume a hotspot will flare up and a show will be canceled here and there. But we’re confident, long-term, the show will happen. The revenue will flow and the fan will show up.On a macro – on a micro 2020, as I think Joe mentioned, most of our business doesn’t start till the middle of June onwards. So the next few months, we’ll have some cancellations, I assume, here and there in some arenas and clubs, but the heart of our business happens this summer. And we’re optimistic we hope that it can be handled in the summer months bring us some relief and we’ll business as usual. But right now, we’re being cautious looking at all markets, doing the right thing for the artist. We’re playing along with the great demand of this industry.
Brandon Ross: Great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Next, we’ll move to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley
Benjamin Swinburne: Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to ask if you could help us think about the leading indicators you gave in your press release and on the – your opening comments, particularly ticket sold up 10% for 2020, 30% growth in confirmed shows. I don’t think you gave specific guidance financially for 2020, which I understand. But just wondering if you could help put those two numbers into context, because they seem quite robust, even relative to the growth you just delivered in 2019?And then, secondly, and apologize for asking more virus macro-related stuff, but I’m sure you understand why. On the sponsorship side, can you just help us remind us how much of that business is sort of, either annual multi-year relationships versus anything show specific? Just so we can think about if one or two sizable shows are postponed if we should see that impact sponsorship as well? Thank you.
Michael Rapino: I’ll do sponsorship and then I’ll – now sponsorship with most of our – we always talk in our reports about our annual global strategic partners. So most of our contracts are over one to three years, they’re longer-term. They’re not very – the ones that matter are over multiple events, most – mostly multiple markets.So we don’t have the beautiful part of our business, which is dispersed over 30,000 shows is we don’t have one weekend, one show, one event, that’s the $20 million big event. It’s really dispersed across the globe, across different venues and genres, which is the parts that makes us a bit risk adverse.So we see no sponsorship risk at all. If a show canceled, the sponsor would get the show later. We’ll make up for the show. Again, going back to our first point, as long as we’re going to deliver a net over the next two years, the same amount of shows, the growth, the tickets that we’ve kind of delivered for that sponsorship commitment, then, we’ll see no pullback at all in the long-term sponsor.
Benjamin Swinburne: Thanks, Mike.
Michael Rapino: Yes. We’ll talk about the – yes, we’re headed for a record 2020. Business is strong, and Joe will give you – what he can on how will even model that.
Joe Berchtold: Sure, Ben. As you said, we haven’t tried to give you full-year guidance for a couple of reasons. We don’t generally try to do that in February, it’s a bit early. And secondly, with the uncertainty on the specific timing on the OCESA close, it makes it just harder to give you what the overall year looks like.But we absolutely are taking a lot of confidence based on being so far up in terms of the 30% on the show count. The 10% up on the fans. I think both of those are exactly leading indicators. They’re not projections of where we’re going to end up. But I think, they’re strong indicators that we’ll have pretty good growth this year.
Benjamin Swinburne: Thank you.
Operator: Next we’ll move on to Khoa Ngo with Jefferies.
Khoa Ngo: Hi. Good afternoon, all. Thanks for taking the question. On OCESA, is there anything that you can provide any specifics as to why it’s still being held up with the Mexican government?And then just second question is on a more broader level, there was a big transaction that closed in mid-February with one of your competitors and the multiple seems pretty high. And so if we think about the embedded value in the enterprise, if we apply that multiple just for your Ticketing segment, it seems like you can get the concerts and sponsorship pretty – at a pretty attractive multiple. Can you just talk broadly of how you think about the value embedded in the broader enterprise? Thank you.
Michael Rapino: So let me take the first one on OCESA. I think, when we started this several months ago, one of the things that we thought was that, because OCESA just gone through some reviews by the same government entity that they were very familiar with the business and it would be a fairly quick process.As it ended up, this transaction got put with a different team in a different department. So we had to start a little bit more at the basics in terms of the industry. So we weren’t able to shortcut it as much as we thought. There’s nothing that at this point based on most recent discussions to give us great concern, just taking a bit longer.In terms of the transaction, look, our view is simply that we focus on building a great business at Ticketmaster and throughout all of our different pieces. It’s up to you guys in the market, specifically, value them. We’re building this for long-term value for our shareholders up and down the flywheel and we expect it will be successful in doing that.
Khoa Ngo: Thanks very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll move next to Doug Arthur with Huber Research.
Douglas Arthur: Just going back to cover 2019 for a second. Joe, I’m wondering if you could – I mean, my concern would be on the festival business in Europe if there was any kind of wider spread beyond Italy, obviously? As you said, most of that is in the summer, so it’s a ways off.But – and I think five years ago, the festival business in Europe is a big part of your package. I think, it’s less big today as a component, given the growth in other markets. But I’m wondering if you could just sort of size – sort of frame the size of that business for you, if there was some kind of slow down or less attendance or even the cancellations outright of some of these large festivals over on the continent?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I think that our total festival business would be in that low double-digit portion of our total fan base. And I think our largest single festival would probably be roughly half of a percent of our fan base. So we’re across 100 and change festivals. It’s very diversified geographically, diversified time-wise over multiple continents.So if there were to be a situation still, as we get into July and August, and you assume it’s located geographically. I would not expect that to be a broad impact in terms of our fan count.
Douglas Arthur: Okay. And then just one little detail question on the quarter. I kind of asked this question before. But it looks like your event count in North America in the fourth quarter was very high year-over-year and relative to recent quarters. Is that just this continuation of massive growth in small clubs and theaters?
Joe Berchtold: Yes, theaters & clubs. That’s – I think we called out specifically that volume and the growth in my portion on the number of theaters & clubs in the attendance there. So that is what drove most of it in Q4.
Douglas Arthur: And then, there’s no acquisitions in there, right, in North America?
Michael Rapino: Not a substance.
Douglas Arthur: Maybe….
Michael Rapino: Maybe a club released in Philadelphia. Yes, not an acquisition of scale.
Douglas Arthur: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we’ll move on to Stephen Glagola with Cowen.
Stephen Glagola: Hey, good afternoon. As per the company’s Investor Day presentation in November, you guys highlighted a $60 million ticketing AOI opportunity from entering in new markets with a Live Nation promoter presence. These markets primarily consisted of Latin American/Asian countries, just want to ask in light of Ticketmaster’s recent expansion into Asia, in Taiwan and Singapore. Can you just discuss high level the economics of both the Latin America ticketing and Asia ticketing? How those markets may differ structurally from both the United States and Europe and any incremental challenges in those markets that you may be facing? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: You’re well prepared. We’re in – Asia is less than 0.01% or nothing of our business right now. So it’s not a strong business for us currently. I think I would have said on – in liberty that on a global basis, we have a lot of opportunity left international and we look at – we look all across the world from Latin America to South Africa to Asia.We think all those markets in India and et cetera are going to be long-term great markets for us that are – where we have low market share and are starting to put some shows. So we – were happy we’ve got a flag in the ground in and Singapore and Taiwan, small little businesses helped to get more flags in the ground over time.And we think in three to five years from now, we hope the Asian business is a big contributor to our overall business, as well as Latin America. But those are emerging markets still very new. Lots of upside, but not to date don’t actually contribute much to the bottom line.
Stephen Glagola: All right. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I’ll turn the call back over to our speakers for any final or additional comments.
Michael Rapino: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today’s conference call. We do thank you all for your participation.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. My name is Vicky, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters.Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release. The release reconciliation and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at investors.livenationentertainment.com.It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Live Nation delivered its highest AOI quarter ever as we continue to scale our business globally and build on favorable supply/demand dynamics for live music. AOI grew 11% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date, outperforming a record Q3 last year and demonstrating the strength of our business model in today's experience-based economy. And in response to recent questions about consumer demand we are seeing fan spending as strong as ever.In September, our amphitheater and arena shows actually closed stronger than shows in September of last year. And our fan spending on site also showed ongoing growth. At the center of our flywheel, the demand for live events continues to grow as we have sold 92 million tickets through mid-October up 6% or 5 million tickets, compared to this time last year. And we are on track to nearly 100 million fans attending the show this year.And we have translated the fan growth into strong AOI gains on on-site spending, sponsorship and ticketing. As a result, as we wrap-up the successful 2019, we are confident that we will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year.Looking at our concerts business, year-to-date we have had 73 million fans attend over 26,000 concerts delivering $333 million in AOI, which is up 17% from last year.Our international business has been particularly robust this year delivering much of the fan growth with a strong year for stadiums and theaters, while in the U.S. our arena and theater activity was also up.As we have grown our show volume and the breadth of artists, we work with we've also been more effective in pricing tickets closer to the market value, particularly with the platinum pricing tool. So far this year, we have had over 3,000 arena and amphitheater shows use platinum tickets with a 54% increase in the number of platinum tickets sold per show.Looking at our venue operations, we have furthered our focus on the fan experience, improving our hospitality across the board from our food and beverage offering to our lawn experience to VIP options. As a result, we have increased our average revenue per fan by $2.50 in our amphitheaters to over $29, while also increasing fan spending at festivals theaters and clubs.As we continue building our expertise on on-site execution, we are finding more opportunities to build new venues or take over operations of existing venues. And since the start of this year, we have added 36 venues to our portfolio, ranging from the Brooklyn Bowls in New York and Las Vegas to the Danforth Music Hall in Toronto and Sportpaleis in Belgium.As a result, we are confident in the success of our concert flywheel for 2019. We will promote more shows reach more fans price more effectively and provide a better fan experience at our venues which will then drive double-digit AOI growth for the business this year.Turning to sponsorship. With the first days of Rock in Rio and a strong growth across our entire sponsorship platform, our high-margin sponsorship business delivered 18% AOI growth for the quarter and 13% year-to-date. We are the global leader in music sponsorship, delivering the unique value proposition of nearly 100 million fans on-site for brands looking to make a more direct connection with their customers.As part of this, we continue to innovate new ways for brands to interact with fans on-site at our venues and festivals with new programs such as the Bud Light branded photo installation at our amphitheaters or the Revlon roller rink at Lollapalooza. As a result, sponsorship revenue has grown 11% year-to-date at our venues, while festival sponsorship has grown 31% year-to-date.More broadly, growth is driven by our strategic sponsors, all of whom utilize a range of assets and span multiple years. Revenue from this group, which collectively accounted for 70% of our total sponsorship revenue, has grown 15% year-to-date. With over 95% of our expected sponsorship revenue for 2019 now contracted, we are confident that we will deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid-teens for the full year.Ticketmaster generated the highest AOI quarter ever, up 20% from last year and was 6% growth year-to-date as every quarter in 2019 is one of the top 10 GTV quarters ever. This growth continues to provide Ticketmaster the scale to invest in the evolution from paper tickets to digital, which is being demanded by venues and content that are seeking greater control of their tickets and looking to develop a more direct connection with fans.Our Presence rollout is pacing ahead of schedule and we expect digital ticketing to be installed at over 700 venues, representing 120 million tickets by the end of this year and over 60% of the fans at digital-enabled events now are entering with their mobile devices. And digital adoption is even greater in the NFL where 10 teams have now eliminated paper tickets and over 90% of fans for those games are using their mobile phones to get in.Digital ticketing has expanded our engagement with fans giving Ticketmaster a more direct connection providing for more effective marketing and targeted offers. The Ticketmaster app is now regularly in the top 10 ranking for entertainment in the Apple App Store, driving a 30% increase in app downloads this year. This combined with continued improvements in our mobile web experience, has led to further growth in mobile transactions now accounting for 46% of ticket purchases globally, up 15% over last year. Digital ticketing is a strong demonstration of what Ticketmaster can be, providing the best ticketing platform for venues by delivering value well beyond the sale of the ticket, but at the same time giving fans an ever-improving mobile-led purchasing and management experience.With these pieces coming together and continued growth in our concerts activity, I expect we will deliver AOI growth at Ticketmaster in the mid-single digits for the full year. As we approach the end of 2019, we are confident that our strong performance will deliver another record year of topline and AOI growth. All of our businesses, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing have delivered growth year-to-date. And based on their key operating metrics, we expect each to deliver record revenue and AOI for the full year.With an early look to next year, our 2020 pipeline is up substantially with over 1500 stadium arena and amphitheater shows booked already, up double-digits from the same time last year.As we look forward, we continue seeing tremendous opportunity to expand our global concerts and festival business, drive further growth in on-site execution, sponsorship and ticketing.With that I will turn the call over to Joe, who will take you through additional details on the quarter and the divisions.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments first concerts. Over the combined past two quarters, which represent our core concert season, AOI was up 9% and revenue up 2% year-on-year, as we grew attendance 73 million fans at over 26,000 shows, up 3% and 11%, respectively.As we discussed on our second quarter call, timing this year somewhat shifted to Q2 versus Q3. And as a result for the third quarter attendance was 2 million lower than last year, resulting in slightly lower revenue in AOI.Looking at the full season though, every indicator we have is of a robust growing business. Our September results actually came in above our expectations, as our amphitheater and arena shows closed strongly and fan spending remained at high levels. This overperformance in ticket sales in the last two weeks before the shows resulted in over $5 million of incremental AOI in our amphitheaters relative to how the shows closed last year, demonstrating the continued strength of the concert business.As Michael said, much of our fan growth this year has come from our international markets, particularly with their stadium lineup. At the same time, we are seeing growing demands throughout our broad portfolio of venue types. Globally, theater shows are our highest growth venues this year as fans continue to find new up-and-coming artists they're excited about.And festivals remain the ultimate fan experience. And with the addition of Rock in Rio, the continued globalization of the Lollapalooza brand and our over 100 other festivals, we expect attendance to be up double-digits to over 10 million fans this year.Arenas continue to be the top place to see the biggest shows and we expect to add another 1 million fans this year, as fans came to see such top acts as the Backstreet Boys, Ariana Grande and John Mayer. For the fourth quarter, we see continued fan growth again driven by our theater shows but with AOI growth impacted by the cost structure and a seasonally lower period for concert activity.So looking at the growth this year and an even bigger pipeline of shows for next year combined with ongoing improvements in our on-site execution, we believe we are well set up for continued growth in concerts.Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In the third quarter, sponsorship AOI was up 18% and revenue was up 26%, primarily driven by on-site sponsorship as our brand partners continue to recognize the value of engaging with fans at our events.International markets drove the majority of our growth with the first weekend of Rock in Rio contributing to our performance this quarter. And given the 14% growth in sponsor committed net revenue for the year, I'm confident we will deliver mid-teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.Finally Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 20% and revenue was up 5%. Global GTV was up 4% for the quarter, driven by fee-bearing GTV which was up 5%. As with our concerts business, international drove our ticketing growth in the quarter with its fee-bearing GTV, up 19%. Globally, primary GTV was up 6% for the quarter while secondary GTV was flat. And as in the past, concerts drove most of our primary GTV growth.In secondary, we saw growth in sports, particularly the NFL, the lower activity in North America concerts again consistent with the concerts timing we have discussed. As another sign of success for the Ticketmaster platform, our open distribution strategy continues selling more tickets for clients off platform, up over 30% with 15 million tickets sold year-to-date.And to save you the question on margin, yes, we're up a fair bit this quarter, due in part to continued improvements in operational areas such as search marketing and also because of some insurance recovery for the data breach issue last year. But our overall focus remains on growing the cash profitability of the ticketing business, not being margin-focused, which is how we have consistently grown the business over the past several years and expect to continue being successful going forward.In summary, we are confident that 2019 will be another year of record revenue and AOI results, overall and for each of our businesses. We are also making progress on completing our OCESA acquisition. In August, we submitted the necessary request for approval to the two key regulatory agencies in Mexico and are working through their process. And in September, CIE received shareholder approval for the transaction.Pending the timing of the regulatory process, which is basically how many rounds of questions do they need to ask, we expect to complete the transaction between December and February and we'll provide updates as we have more information to share.I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon everyone. Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2019. Our revenue was down 2% to $3.8 billion. AOI increased 11% to $427 million and operating income increased 11% to $260 million. Our revenue decline in the quarter was primarily driven by a foreign exchange negative impact and without this, our revenue in the quarter was flat to last year. This FX impact largely affected concert, which along with the timing shift in events from Q3 to Q2 drove a 4% decrease in revenue.Sponsorship revenue increased 26% from the addition of the first weekend of Rock in Rio in Brazil and overall growth in our on-site sponsorship program. And ticketing delivered a 5% increase in revenue as strong international activity drove a 4% increase in global GTV.AOI growth was 11% in the third quarter driven mainly by sponsorship, which was up 18% and ticketing, which was up 20%, as a result of the higher GTV along with an insurance recovery related to the third-party data breach incident last year that we had not expected to receive in the quarter. This insurance recovery along with the strength in amphitheater show performance at the end of the quarter as Joe noted previously, drove our outperformance relative to the AOI guidance we provided in July.Our operating income increased by 11% for the third quarter over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $24 million and our diluted earnings per share was $0.71.Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.8 billion including $747 million in ticketing client cash and $642 million in net concert event-related cash leaving free cash of $406 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months was $33 million compared to $256 million last year, primarily due to the timing of when payment obligations were due.Free cash flow adjusted for the nine months was $531 million in line with last year's $529 million. Our conversion of AOI to free cash flow this year was reduced by the timing of distribution to our non-controlling interest partners and an increase in maintenance CapEx.Our total capital expenditures were $225 million for the first nine months with $120 million spent on revenue-generating items. We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $325 million with half going toward revenue-generating CapEx projects.As of September 30, our total deferred revenue related to future events was $952 million, an increase of 26% over the $759 million at this point last year. As of September 30, our total debt was $2.8 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.2%.And in October, we issued $950 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 and amended our senior secured credit facility including a new $950 million term loan B. In addition we have an undrawn $500 million revolver and a $400 million delayed draw term loan A. The proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem our $250 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2022 and to repay the outstanding balance of our existing term loan.After these repayments and other fees and expenses we will have $527 million of incremental cash on the balance sheet. This will allow us to meet the cash portion of our purchase price for the OCESA acquisition along with funding other acquisition opportunities.After this refinancing our weighted average cost of debt remains at 4.2% and we estimate that our interest expense will initially increase by approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter as a result of this refinance.For the remainder of 2019 we expect negative FX impacts of approximately 2% for revenue and 7% for AOI in the fourth quarter based on current rates. This FX headwind to AOI is largely driven by higher sponsorship activity in Brazil, Australia and New Zealand which are all projected to be up 7% in the fourth quarter and the Euro and British Pound which are projected to be up 4% to 5%.Revenue has less of an impact as that mix is more heavily weighted to the U.S.. We have factored this FX impact into our full year guidance that both Michael and Joe discussed which takes into consideration our reported year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter.Consistent with where we projected it last quarter we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid-50s. Our accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately $26 million. And as a reminder as you look forward to 2020 our Rock in Rio Festival which spans Q3 and Q4 this year is a biannual festival and will therefore not take place next year.Thank you for joining us today. Operator we will now open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. You highlighted getting questions around consumer demand. I think maybe some of this pertained to macro and possibly recession risk. And the last time there was a downturn Live Nation was a pretty different company than it is today. So I'd be interested to know how you feel Live is positioned should we enter a softer economic period at some point?
Joe Berchtold: Hey, David, this is Joe. I'll start that. First again as we gave with some of our numbers we have seen whatever periodic retail slowness in September or anything else that the market has looked at we have not seen that impact us at all. And in fact September this year as I gave the numbers was stronger than September of last year. So we're feeling very good how it's holding up in general.As you said, we think we're very different company than we were 10 years ago. We think our understanding of the consumer, our level of sophistication associated with pricing understanding different consumer segments, our ability to execute on site are all substantially higher. So we feel like our capabilities have certainly continued to develop and that the structural tailwinds we have and shifts in spend from goods to experience the globalization of our business all trends that lead to a lot of demand support under any economic scenario.
Michael Rapino: And also this is -- it's Michael -- just to tie in. We're seeing also what is on sale for next year. Festivals and shows that are already on sale for next summer are showing strong demand no weakness at all in terms of the consumer buying the ticket. As well as Joe said our - people come to the shows in September spending at the show. So we haven't seen any pushback at all business as usual from a sales perspective.
David Karnovsky: Okay. Very helpful. And then you highlighted an additional 36 venues year-to-date. I'm interested to know if you anticipate accelerating the strategy. Is there a specific type of venue that you're more focused on? And then finally I've been interested to get your view on Groot hospitality and how that adds to the portfolio.
Michael Rapino: All right. I'll take a shot. You're coming across a little muffled there so I think -- I got to adjust a bit. We've always been in the on-site business and our most profitable businesses are our festivals where we get to count multiple revenue streams and our amphitheaters 50 of them that we have in America. Those will be our highest-margin concert venues or concert business. So we've always been expanding and looking at leasing and managing concert venues.We've had a portfolio of theaters and clubs House of Blues, Fillmores well over 100 of them now around the world. We've been managing those for the last 15 years or so. We like to look businesses – as they continue to be high on our contents, sponsorship and our ticketing. So we are continually looking at any concert venue from 500 feet up to amphitheaters if they're pure-play concert venues where our content can leverage our relationship into multiple revenue streams by managing or leasing or building that music venue. So on a global basis we continue to look at them as great returns. And they're the places that our flywheel comes to life the most leverageable in terms of content sponsorship and ticketing.
David Karnovsky: Okay. And just anything on Groot? I'm not sure if it came through on the question.
Michael Rapino: Groot, yes. So part of we've been talking about in the last two years in our hospitality food and beverage business is we are a very large food and beverage business on our own. If you just spun off food and beverage business we will be a world-leading hospitality food and beverage in terms of our revenue and footprint. And a big part of our revenue hospitality strategy is to continue to make sure we understand the high-end consumer and the hospitality around VIP and servicing that customer well.Our core DNA knows how to put a lot of people through buildings in an efficient manner and service them. We want to get more skill set to understand how to take care of the VIP high-end customer how best to set up the VIP, what does that VIP flow look like, how best to monetize the customers with a better and higher experience or unique experience.So Dave is an expert in the business in Miami. He's very successful in what he does. He's tested it at the Miami Dolphins stadium with his platform there. So we look at him and other skill sets like that that if we bring those in-house, open our platform to them, they will help us design, build and expand our VIP hospitality business in our current portfolio.
David Karnovsky: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin Swinburne: Thank you, good morning. Just first on digital ticketing. You talked about Presence being ahead of schedule. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that? Is that demand driven or your ability to deploy that technology faster? And clearly it's resonating with consumers. You can see it in the app download data. Can you help us think about the financial benefits to the company over the longer term as that scales to become a majority or vast majority of your ticketing business?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. This is Joe. I'll give it a start. First of all, in terms of the pace and why it's deploying faster. Two things, one is I think we've been successful because of how effective it's been both with the NFL as well as our own buildings. We're just seeing tremendous demand by other venues that are saying, we don't want to get left behind. We want to shift to digital, so we can be getting that consumer data, understanding better control of the ticket as well.And our processes for deploying the systems actually going to the venues, changing the access control systems, we've gotten that working well very quickly. So I think that has led us over the course of this year to move our target for installations from 500 to 600 now to 700 installations.So in terms of the long-term impact, clearly just for Ticketmaster, it's a fundamentally different value proposition that it provides through its venues now. It's no longer just selling a ticket, but it is providing an important data service. So that's an important piece of just what Ticketmaster is.And then we talked through there are a multitude of uses that the data will provide. It will support Ticketmaster and our concert business in terms of the effectiveness of their marketing, their ability to provide much more targeted information to fans based on what we think they're interested in. They'll be very important to our venue strategy in terms of being able to make offers to people based on what their past behavior is. It will be important for sponsors for them to directly tie in sponsor segments -- customer segments and target -- 100 million people are on-site. So the ability to do all of those things over the next several years, I think will be tremendously important throughout the entire company.
Benjamin Swinburne: Got it. That's helpful. And just maybe one follow-up. The show pipeline for next year as you highlighted is up double digits. I know it's too early to talk about 2020 in a lot of detail, but does that suggest that events will be up double digits next year? Because you also have fairly sizable acquisition, which should close as well. I don't know if I'm over extrapolating but I just wanted to ask?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. A couple of things. First of all, we haven't built in OCESA in our numbers yet because of the uncertainty over -- plus or minus a few months in terms of the timing. And so anything that we also give you in terms of the on sale would not have included them because we're not yet changing that data with them. I think, what you can take from it be up double digits at this point is two things. One is, it looks very strong for next year both in terms of the volume and then as Michael said, the early demand for what we do have put on sale is also very strong. And two is you're continuing the trend of seeing some shift into the fourth quarter in terms of timing and some of the onsales. So, I don't think we're ready to declare the exact amount that we're going to be up, but we're feeling very good as we're starting to turn the focus to 2020 shows.
Benjamin Swinburne: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Joyce with Evercore ISI.
David Joyce: Thank you. A couple of questions. First, on the deferred revenue being up 26%, what would that look like excluding the one week of Rock in Rio that falls in this quarter? And could you discuss other comparable planning events that would be impacting the concert performance for the fourth quarter? And then secondly, on CapEx, if you could talk about some of the components of the revenue-generating CapEx. What have you been doing on the real estate side?
Kathy Willard: So on the deferred revenue yes Rock in Rio would be in there. But remember Rock in Rio as most festivals are is largely sponsorship-driven. And we haven't given any specific breakdowns. But the second weekend would be in Q4. We -- what we said on the other comments are that Q4 is largely going to be theaters and clubs-driven. So that will be part of it. And you will also be seeing some of the impacts of the onsales for next year in there as well. As far as CapEx, rev gen is going to be highly around. We said we added 36 venues. Part of that is going to be running through that continued enhancement along the Ticketmaster technology as well.
Joe Berchtold: It's probably hospitality, right? Michael talked to hospitality. We talked a lot about the growth in forecast. We gave specific numbers at the end, but also around our festivals and our theaters as well. So, all of that is fairly a priority on our rev gen CapEx.
David Joyce: Great. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we will go next to Brandon Ross with LightShed.
Brandon Ross: Hello.
Joe Berchtold: Go ahead, Brandon.
Brandon Ross: Okay. Sorry, we're having some phone troubles here. We're a startup. So, on sponsorship, you lowered your guide for the year from mid -- to mid-teens from mid to high. I guess you said the consumer is in great shape, but I just wanted to make sure you're finding the same with advertisers and sponsors. Or is there anything to read into there vis-à-vis the demand for Rock in Rio? And then on ticketing, I think your Q4 ticketing guide implies flat AOI year to year. How do we reconcile that with your increased show pipeline for next year and this continued trend to a shift in timing to Q4 onsales from Q1?
Joe Berchtold: So on the first question, there is absolutely no shift in our overall outlook on sponsorship. The only change in our previous guidance was constant currency. But we saw a lot of modeling issues with people trying to understand constant versus reported. So, we shifted guidance to reported currency. And we gave you very explicitly and Kathy the fact that you're up 7% in Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and 4% to 5% in Great Britain and in Europe. So it's just that math that's having an effect and change where the numbers are. No change in terms of just what we would have given you constant currency versus reported.
Michael Rapino: Plus the demand.
Joe Berchtold: The demand is -- yeah, absolutely no change, no deterioration. In terms of second -- without getting to exact -- there's still some timing to be worked out in terms of exact onsales for ticketing. And then ticketing again you're going to have some of the same issues in terms of some of the FX impact.But overall, again, we're seeing robust show pipeline and robust consumer demand when we do flip them on show -- sorry, when we do flip the show to onsale. It's just a matter of when exactly they're all going to get put on sale.So we have a lot of shows that we have confirmed with the artists that they'll be touring. We have contracts with them. We're scheduling them. We have not declared whether those actual tours are going on sale in Q4 or Q1.
Kathy Willard: And we're comping up a large Q4 last year on ticketing. So just keep that in mind in your whole comparison.
Brandon Ross: Got it. Thanks for the question.
Operator: And we will go next to Khoa Ngo with Jefferies.
Khoa Ngo: Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Michael Rapino: Yeah.
Khoa Ngo: So first question is just around, you mentioned the strength of the consumer and you're not seeing any slowdown there. Can you maybe just frame up how much headroom you have on your ability to price the shows as we look forward?And then the second question is around the digital ticketing. Are there any gating factors to you increasing the venue rollout above 700 as we think about maybe 1,000 1,200? And as we move forward are there any gating factors for that?
Joe Berchtold: So, first on consumer strength. The pricing headroom I think most recent number we've given is, we think there's still probably about $1 billion of price arbitrage if we look at the secondary market as a guide for market value of ticket prices relative to how we price tickets.And we absolutely believe that one of the factors during any economic slowdown is that provides the buffer. And that arbitrage gets eaten away before some of the fundamental demand hits our ticket. So that absolutely is a piece that gives us some greater comfort as we think about different economic cycles.In terms of digital ticketing the rollout, I think by the end of this year we'll have 80% of the major building. One gating factor is just you're not going to have your NBA and NHL teams yet mid-season. So if they didn't shift before the start of the season, they won't shift between now and the end of the year. It would be when they take a break again during their next cycle. And then it's just a matter of getting to a lot of the smaller buildings.
Michael Rapino: Yes. It's Michael. Just on pricing just to give some narrative, the press likes to talk sometimes about the ticket pricing of the high shows. Overall concerts are at a very affordable price point. If you look at the average ticket pricing the $60 average fans go to two or three shows a year. It's still a very affordable lifetime memory versus a trip or a vacation.So in recession, we see that the consumer may pull back on high ticket items. They may not go on a vacation, may pull back on a new car. But to take his kids to Taylor Swift or his wife to a show or his friend, it's still a very, very affordable option that we know, because they're lifetime moments and Kodak moments of your life. They still make sure they go to that local show at the arena or stadium or amphitheater, because it's still incredibly affordable even if they're in a slight pullback on their cash spend.Now, I say that it also means we have -- why we believe the ticket is completely still underpriced like those $8 billion to $10 billion in the secondary market on an ongoing basis, we still think that the front of the house is widely underpriced. And year-over-year we'll make progress with the artists to keep pricing it better and taking some of that high-end opportunity into his pocket as well as lowering the price in the back end to get better -- full capacity.So, overall, we think the show is still a very affordable option in life, cheaper than a good dinner in a big picture with great pricing opportunity given we still think it is a very low-priced option if you compare it to an NBA game, a night at the theatre, a front-row seat at an NFL game, et cetera. So, we think concert is underpriced, lots of room for pricing, still affordable to everybody, no matter where their economic situation lies. And we think the secondary is the proof that we have upside.
Khoa Ngo: Thanks very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Bazinet: Yeah. I just had a question on CapEx. I know you guys have always talked about 2% CapEx to revs. It seems like with the ticket move up in CapEx we're approaching sort of 3%. Do you see enough sort of good revenue opportunities that we should be thinking sort of 3% of revs as sort of a more reasonable number in the interim in the next few years as opposed to 2%? Or is 2019 sort of an aberration? Thanks.
Kathy Willard: So, part of that just to restate. Those 2% were back before rev rec changes. So, it made a little bit of an increase in it. But I think around 2.5% is probably the right rule. And some years may cross a little bit above that. But just, yes, there are a lot of what we think are good investment opportunities, in our business in hospitality, in our technology that we think they're the right way to continue to invest in the business.
Jason Bazinet: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Doug Arthur with Huber.
Doug Arthur: Yeah. Hi. It's Doug Arthur. Joe, I'm wondering if you could delve into the mix in the concert business a little bit more in the third quarter. Obviously, you had cited some timing issues going into the quarter. The number of events in North America was up 15%. It looks like attendance for event was down close to 20%. So that's a pretty unusual mix for the third quarter. Does that reflect the lack of stadium shows basically? Or is there something else going on?
Joe Berchtold: You have it exactly right. It's the mix shift. So if you look at -- just to start if you look at Q2 and Q3 together, because we told you we were going to have more weight in Q2 this year. But those two quarters together is the core concert segment. The concert business is up about 4%, on constant currency.So, first of all, you move a few points on the revenue side just because of the currency fluctuation. But really what's going on, as we've told you over the past nine months is we have fewer stadium shows. We have about 30 fewer stadium shows, this year than last year.And we've had tremendous growth in our theater shows in particular both in North America and internationally. Those stadium shows that we don't have are the highest-volume shows. And also the highest average ticket price.Your theater shows are going to be a much lower, average attendance. And also a lower ticket price. So all you're seeing is some mix shift going on. There still is across all of the venue type's very strong sell-through demand.We talked about platinum tickets. We talked about all of the components. So the performance is very strong across the board. And then, as we look at next year, we see a big uptick again, in our stadium volume which is what you get the first read on in the business, so, we're doing very good. There's absolutely nothing you should read into this other than timing.
Doug Arthur: Great, thank you.
Operator: At this time, I would like to hand the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: Thank you everybody.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. My name is Karenna, and I will be your conference facilitator for today.

Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. We delivered strong growth for the quarter, with AOI up 23%, and revenue up 10%. Each of our businesses contributed to these results, with all of them delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter.We continue to benefit from a strong tailwind in the live event, experience-based economy of today. The global ticket revenue for our concerts is up 16% for the first half of the year, as we continue to see a strong supply of artists touring matched with global consumer demand. And within this, the ticket revenue from concerts outside our top 100 artists is up 32% for the year, demonstrating that the demand for live music is strong and growing from the largest stadiums to the local clubs.We have created the most scalable and unparalleled business model in the industry, building a platform that brings over 570 million fans in 45 countries to live events each year.With our key metrics in concerts, sponsorship and ticketing all pacing well ahead of last year, I am confident that 2019 the company will deliver again double-digit AOI growth.Starting with our concerts business, through mid-July we have sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year, up 6% or 4.5 million tickets from the same point last year. This puts us on track to have nearly 100 million fans attend 38,000 concerts this year.In the second quarter, we had 27 million fans attend 10,000 shows, up 7% and 9%, respectively, from last year, and by far our largest second quarter ever. As a result, for the quarter we grew AOI by 33% and revenue a 11%.As we have discussed, our international business has been particularly strong through the first half, growing our fan base by 2.5 million fans with the greatest growth coming from our arenas, stadiums and theaters.Globally, we continue to work with artists to enable them to capture the value from their shows, through optimized pricing and Ticketmaster tools such as Platinum, we have delivered over $500 million in incremental value to artists since the start of 2018. Through this, we have seen no reduction in demand, and global sell-through rates across stadiums, arenas and amphitheaters is strong as ever.Further, at our venues we continue to increase average fan per spend by enhancing the fan experience, providing reasons for them to arrive earlier, spending less time in line and improving the quality of food and beverage offerings. As a result, our ancillary revenue per fan at amphitheaters to grow by $2.50 this year.Overall, we see continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to grow our global market share, both organically and via targeted acquisitions. Our just announced acquisition of OCESA in Mexico, one of the top global promoters, continues our mission of building a global fan base of 125 million. All this gives me confidence that we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth in our concerts business this year.Our sponsorship business leverages our platform of nearly 100 million fans, providing brands a unique opportunity to connect directly with music fans at scale. By continuing to attract new brand partners and expand relationships with existing ones, we grew our AOI by 12% in the second quarter and revenue by 8%.Much of the growth continue to come from large strategic partnerships, all of whom utilize a range our assets and span multiple years. This group accounts for over 70% of our total sponsorship, and the number of these sponsors has grown double-digits this year as we have added companies such as Adobe, Hyundai and Google. As a result, the committed spend by these strategic sponsors is also up double-digits through mid-July.Globally, festivals in particular provide an attractive opportunity for sponsors to engage fans at time when they are receptive to brand messages. And once again, our festival sponsorship is on track for revenue per fan to be up double-digits this year, thanks in part to a growing portfolio of marquee festivals including Lollapalooza, Rock in Rio and EDC, which are of particular interest to brand partners.Given the attractiveness of our platform to brands, and the double-digit growth in committed net revenue for the year, I expect we’ll deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid-to-high teens for the full year.Ticketmaster continues to demonstrate that it is the best global ticketing marketplace for venues, teams, artists and fans, with fee-bearing GTV growth of 13% at constant currency in a quarter, making it our highest second quarter GTV ever. As a result, Ticketmaster’s AOI for the quarter was up 20% and revenue up 6%.The addition of major clients such as Evenko in Canada, Chase Center in the U.S., O2 in Prague, and 150 others worldwide further validates that Ticketmaster is content’s choice as the most effective ticketing platform in the world, with leading technology to service venues, sports teams and artists, with an efficient marketplace that attracts and converts ticket buyers.Our industry-leading digital ticketing rollout is ahead of schedule, with Presence now expected to be installed at over 600 venues this year, including over 80% of major sports buildings and Live Nation amphitheaters.And as the ticket is increasingly digital, we are focused on ensuring our mobile marketplace are the easiest place for fans to buy and manage their tickets. Because of that, we have seen a continued shift to mobile ticket buying, up 22% from the second quarter last year and now account for 45% of global ticket sales to date. At the same time, we have been improving the consumer purchase process, with increased conversion both across mobile and desktop.As Ticketmaster continues to be an effective and efficient ticketing solution for content and fans alike, we expect to continue growing its GTV and result in AOI this year and into the future.In summary, 2019 is on track for the company to deliver double-digit AOI growth along with strong gains in revenue. Each of our businesses is contributing to the success, starting with concerts as we put on more shows for more fans, then continuing to monetize fans at the concert, sell more tickets to the shows, and further deliver value to our sponsors from our platform of nearly 100 million fans.With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more details of our performance this quarter.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments, first Concerts. Live Nation Concerts AOI in the second quarter was up 33% and revenue was up 11%. Driving that growth, concerts had its highest second quarter attendance ever, and for the first half of the year we saw fan growth across most of our venue types with arenas, stadiums and theaters each up over a million fans.And as Michael mentioned, we continue to optimize pricing, providing incremental artist revenue of $500 million since the start of 2018 across all of our shows, driven largely by an increase of over 30% in front of house pricing at amphitheaters and arenas globally.Bookings of a full year, we have already sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year through mid-July, an increase of 6% and we now expect nearly 100 million fans for the full year. Our pipeline of arena and amphitheater shows continues to be very robust with over 5600 shows booked through mid-July, up 3% compared to this point last year.Our international stadiums and arenas are looking particularly strong, driven by acts such as Metallica in Europe, post-Malone in Australia and BLACKPINK in Asia. While our amphitheaters are not driving substantial fan growth this year after attendance growth of over 2.5 million last year, we continue to be very successful in driving ancillary spend per fan. And festival tickets are up double-digits through mid-July and we expect this to continue for the full year, our 100 plus festivals hosts over 10 million fans this year.We expect our theater attendance to be up over 20% for the year and part benefiting from investments to expand our footprint with new venues such as the Fillmore in New Orleans and the Observatory venues in Southern California added to our portfolio in the first half of the year.With good visibility into the full year based on mid single digit growth in global fan attendance and continued operating improvements, we're confident that we will again deliver double-digit growth in concerts AOI for the full year.Turning to our Sponsorship and Advertising business. Our Sponsorship AOI was up 12% in the second quarter, while revenue was up 8%. Most of our growth came from the sponsorship side fairly evenly split between North America and international markets.As part of the growth in strategic sponsors that Michael mentioned, we have also successfully expanded the breadth of our sponsorship categories with the addition of non-traditional categories such as fashion, beauty and retail, including companies such as American Apparel, Pantene and Asics.Additionally investments in unique sponsor experiences within our venues, including VIP viewing decks and Instagram-worthy installations have drawn new sponsors and increased spending from existing ones. Collectively, this has led to 18% year-to-date growth in sponsor committed net revenue for the year. And based on this progress, we are confident we will deliver mid to high teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.Finally Ticketmaster. For the second quarter Ticketmaster AOI was up 20% and revenue up 6%. Looking at our GTV growth in constant currency, total global fee bearing GTV was up 13% for the quarter and is now flat for the full year, with second quarter growth making up for the full forward from Q1 into Q4 of last year.The increasing global fee bearing GTV was driven predominantly by a 15% increase in primary GTV. And international was the main driver of our fee bearing GTV growth up over 40% for the quarter.Concerts activity continues to drive our growth accounting for over 90% of primary GTV growth in the quarter, heavily benefiting from our theaters festivals and arena activity.Secondary GTV was flat in the second quarter with increased activity in sports, offset by lower concerts volume and overall lower international activity. Based on our results for the first half and our second half pipeline, we expect Ticketmaster to deliver mid single digit AOI growth for the full year.In summary, Q2 is an outstanding quarter demonstrating the continued strong supply and demand dynamics across all of our businesses. Looking at the third quarter, comping 50 million AOI growth last year in Q3 and impacted by some shifts in concert timing into Q2, we expect Q3 to be up mid to high single digits. And as we continue driving growth across all of our businesses, we remain confident that 2019 will be another year of record top line and AOI results.I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard: Thanks, Joe. And good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the second quarter of 2019, our revenue was up 10% to $3.2 billion, AOI increased 23% to $319 million and operating income increased 27% to $172 million. All of our segments contributed to the increase in revenue, with concerts up $259 million or 11%, driven primarily by international arenas and stadium, along with global theater and festival activity.Sponsorship was up 8% due to growth from strategic sponsors and festivals in both North America and Europe and ticketing revenue increased 6% due to higher primary ticket fees.Our AOI growth of 23% for the second quarter was again driven by all three segments with each delivering double-digit growth for the quarter. Concerts increased by 33%, ticketing was up 20% and sponsorship grew by 12% from the growth drivers discussed above.Our operating income increased by 27% for the second quarter over last year, driven by the increase in AOI which also drove the increase in net income for the quarter to $103 million as compared to $69 million last year. For the quarter accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $14 million, with a diluted earnings per share of $0.41.Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30th we had total cash of $2.3 billion, including $777 million in ticketing client cash and $1.1 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving free cash of $363 million.Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months was $293 million compared to $520 million last year due to the timing of event related working capital. Free cash flow adjusted for the six months was in line with last year at $223 million, driven by our AOI increase, the timing of distributions to non-controlling interest partners and the maintenance capital expenditures for the first half of the year.As of June 30th, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.6 billion consistent with 2018. Our total capital expenditures were $139 million for the first six months with 57% spent on revenue generating item.Our total debt as of June 30th was $2.8 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.2%. For the remainder of 2019, we continue to expect that accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest will be $62 million for the full year with the remainder fairly evenly split between the remaining quarters.In Q2 we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI of about 2% percent, and based on current rates we expect them both to be impacted negatively by 1% to 2% in the third quarter.We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $310 million, with more than half on revenue generating CapEx. And we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid 50.Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Karnovsky: Hi. Just on OCESA I know you've partnered with them for a number of years, but how did the acquisition now accelerate this both on the promotion and ticketing side in Latin America? And then just as a follow on, can you provide any detail around what you expect for the time line of regulatory approvals in Mexico and Columbia?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. This is Joe. I’ll answer those in reverse order. I think our expectations on regulatory approval with Q4 later in the year we don't know the exact timing. So we're not building it into our expectations at this point. But probably in a way part of a year and then I'll let Michael talk about how OCESA and how that's going to help us accelerate as we grow further in Mexico. Thank you.
Michael Rapino: Yes, we're excited about the acquisition. It's consistent with our ongoing strategy. We still think there's a big fragmented global business out there. A lot of bolt-ons and both the concert, festival, venue side. Some of them are chunkier than others. This happens to be a top five global business.So we think this is a overall smart business. It helps us on our sponsorship, as brands are looking more and more for global solutions. That obviously helps our ticketing business and helps our tour - our global touring business. Aside from it obviously lays a big foundation to how we can continue to build our Latin American business. So it's checks the box on an all of our core growth drivers and we'll be excited when we close in the fall.
David Karnovsky: Okay. We saw some press reports that Live Nation may potentially take majority ownership in Rock City. Can you confirm if this is the case and whether the Rock in Rio festival will be included in your consolidated results this year?
Kathy Willard: Yes. Our guidance that we will give is all - we did give result based on Rock in Rio included and we will be able to consolidate for this year's festival.
David Karnovsky: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
David Joyce: Thank you. If you could please provide some more color on your sizing of OCESA and their activities in 2018 and what are the opportunities in Rock in Rio, I don't think you have the ticketing for that right now. But in the past they've also taken that to other cities. Do you have any - the plans you can talk about there yet? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold: I'll work backwards, Rock in Rio is a -- one of the top festivals in the world, probably on ticket sales over 7000 and probably it actually ranks as the biggest selling festival in the world. It doesn't happen every year, it happens every second year. And that's part of the magic and that the brand is created.So we think in itself it's a great big brand on a global basis. It obviously makes our entry into Brazil, give us some complete kind of an instant office sponsorship division to start building out our own concert business. And then as well you mentioned it will - as we try to do with all our bolt-on or acquisitions we ultimately look for ticketing synergy. In this case we don't have Ticketmaster there and we'll look to the to launch that to support our services in Brazil from there.OCESA, we don't usually talk about these until we close them because of the size we did this in this case, so we're not going to give much details today on OCESA and the numbers. Those will all be out in an 8-K when we actually close the deal and see it as a public company, so you could probably go figure out a lot of the math from the other side.But we're excited. They’re strong business vertical like ourselves with ticketing, venues, sponsorship festivals and touring. So - and then they've been our partner for years and we're excited to have them as part of our platform.
David Joyce: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And moving on, we’ll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Please go ahead.
Doug Arthur: Yes, thanks. Joe, just looking - digging into the metrics on the concert segment in the second quarter, I mean, you highlighted the growth in international. It looks like your attendance in North America was actually down, but obviously events were up, so a lot of smaller shows. Should we read in anything into that for the third quarter, you talked about the fact that the amps are not going to be the big source of growth this year? Or is this just kind of quarter-to-quarter noise?
Joe Berchtold: I wouldn't read anything into it at all. It's a combination of quarter-to-quarter and geographic bouncing around. So we've talked a lot about stadiums are very strong in international and that's where the stadium activity tends to have the bulk going on this year. So that's going to have some shift there. And whenever you have theaters is on fire as they are, that's not going to give you the same attendance per show.So again, I wouldn't read anything at all into it. Amps that incredible growth last year of over 2.5 million fans. So usually you don't see the same element in the same geography driving your growth multiple year - multiple years in a row. It tends to move around with the different pieces the growth come from.
Michael Rapino: But to give us some perspective, if you look at amps over five years they've been continually growing at a great year. We expect them to keep growing. 2018 was an exceptional growth. If you've leveled out that growth this would be a great year. And we think next year and the year after the business will continue to grow.But also we've been -- we've always said one of the great realities of Live Nation is we diversify ourself on a global and venue platform. So sometimes international happens to be a little hotter than the U.S., amps are bigger than stadiums or stadiums might be bigger than arenas that year.And that's how we've always diversified ourselves where one may maybe 50 shows less than the year before. But the other segment or the other country happened to be on fire. So that's always been our goal - our global goal of having a diverse global business. And you ride the cycles that way, but you net the overall growth continually.
Doug Arthur: And on the festival side despite - I mean, you highlighted this at the end of the first quarter that at least one or two major festivals would move into the second quarter this year versus third year ago. Sounds like you're still pretty bullish on this festival outlook for the balance through the third quarter?
Joe Berchtold: No question this is a great year for festivals, as we said we'll have over 10 million fans at our festivals this year. The portfolio continues to perform extremely well. Along with what Michael said, it's part of the reason why we're in every venue type and why we have large portfolios. So when we see the aggregate growing we can have the type of success that we are.
Doug Arthur: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Drew Borst: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the onsite fan spending at your amps. I noticed that you guys did increase the guidance, you expect an additional $2.50 per fan this year, up from 2. I guess the question is, as you're rolling out presence into your amps, I think one of the opportunities is to use the platform for promotions of concessions and I guess I'm wondering connecting these two things, is that part of the reason you're seeing this incremental growth? Have you rolled out those promotions at the amps using presence or is that something that's still to come down the line?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. Drew this is Joe. First of all, the shift from 2 to 50 when we gave you the two at the beginning of the May that was based on plans in place, it hadn't really had shows to speak of in a ramp yet. Now that we've had third number of shows, we're comfortable giving you more specific guidance based on what our results through the first third plus of our shows have been.As it relates to Presence, 100% agree, Presence is a great opportunity for us to engage fans on site and the per cap spending will absolutely be part of that, but it's not this year. That’s as we're getting it fully rolled out and the promotions built that'll be more of a next year and go forward opportunity.
Drew Borst: Okay. If I could ask one or two more. On the Rock in Rio festival you guys made some disclosures in 8-K when you made the acquisition about the financials of Rock City. I think I did all the math right. It looked like the last time in 2017 when they had the festival the EBITDA was somewhere on the order of $20 million to $25 million.Could you just confirm is that - that sound about right. I mean, obviously that might - hope that it grows now that you guys are sort of involved. But am I thinking about it sort of broadly correctly?
Kathy Willard: Yes, those numbers are reasonable.
Drew Borst: Okay.
Kathy Willard: And it’s a sponsorship business as well.
Drew Borst: Great. And then just lastly, probably for you Kathy. Just on CapEx, I know it looks like you're - through the six months you're at 130 up about 30%. Can you just talk about sort of the full year expectations for CapEx?
Kathy Willard: Yes, we said that we expect full year to be around $310 million at this point and over half of that's on revenue generating items. So it's including things like Presence rollout and increased benefits at the amphitheaters that’s growing that EPS just…
Joe Berchtold: We talked about some of the theaters that we've been building. So again, we think revenue generating CapEx spend growth is a good thing. It's capturing the opportunities that are out there and we think that it's running at 57% right now. We think that's a great use of the capital to keep building the business.
Drew Borst: And then sorry, just finally, really last one. On OCESA, Televisa made some disclosures about how much you're paying to them, it looks like it's about $272 million for their 40% stake, but you're also buying another 11% from CIE. Is it somewhere in the order - we're talking about like maybe 350 to 375 sort of cash outlay for this acquisition is that about right?
Michael Rapino: That's so nice. Like we should…
Joe Berchtold: I mean, the K be coming out shortly that'll have all the numbers laid out, so rather than give loose numbers now I think better - to better get that in fairly short order.
Drew Borst: Very well thank. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Tinker with Gabelli. Please go ahead.
John Tinker: Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. I noticed that in the eBay numbers that StubHub was still up, I mean, volume was up 6%, revenue was up 7%. How do you think they keep growing given that you have been very effective at disintermediating the box?
Joe Berchtold: Is he going to ask me Formula 1 question next?
John Tinker: You are 60% of value Formula 1, that we should – I actually thought that Live Nation was an option on formula…
Joe Berchtold: That was a good note, I'll take it. We're not going to get into the competitor in StubHub. You've been following their numbers over the years. It's a tough business on its own. We think our businesses long term has a great global opportunity. We don't think secondary is a business in itself long term, we think it's a - it's a piece of the overall global ticketing business that we're in. So we like our global position. We like our product mix right now and we like our client base. So I'm not sure what they do.
John Tinker: I noticed that certain Event [ph] bought 48% of Front’s BLA [ph] option to take control of it in four years. So had you took a look at the rest of the world how would you sort of rank in terms of priorities the countries you're looking at or the continents?
Joe Berchtold: We wouldn't rank them. We think its -- we're in 44 countries. So, I think Event is not - nowhere near that. So we are a global business. So we look at opportunity more on a city by basis. There are great opportunities to grow in New York that we're going to invest in, as well as there are in Singapore and Tokyo.So, being as diverse as we are on a global basis we still kind of have our hit list of cities and markets where we think we're underdeveloped and whether it's a promoter or a festival or a venue, we want to fill that portfolio in a bolt-on.So you'll continue to see us shopping around the world where it makes sense to build that local market where we can drive our overall business.
John Tinker: Okay, thanks. Congratulations on the quarter again.
Joe Berchtold: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our next question from Kyle Evans with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Kyle Evans: Thanks for taking my questions. Platinum looks like a great pricing solution, what inning do you think we're in for adoption. How much of the house could end up being dynamically priced? If we look out into the future and are you seeing any kind of impact on your own secondary market where I think GTV was flat in the quarter?
Joe Berchtold: Yes, I'll start then Joe can give you some background. I mean, I'll just go macro. I think we're in the - I think sports is in a very different meaning than music, which is - obviously because they're more controlled, the leagues can make global decision. So I think sports is in the sixth or seventh inning in terms of how do they price the show or their content, how do they maximize it with the right combination of pricing.I think music is in a, the second, third inning on. How do we best price our event? How do we price a Thursday show versus a Saturday, an aisle seat versus the middle at the beginning and the end subscriptions, all the different ways that the artist can engage.So Platinum is a - I think been a super tool to tell the artist that there's a great way on your on sale to get a higher price for a good seat. And that's been very successful and I think that is still early days in the overall business. If you look at how much is still being traded on secondary, I would say there's still a huge opportunity for the artists to keep looking at find that fine line between what his brand message needs to be and what his pricing strategy will be. We still think there's many innings left to capture more.And when I say capture more, I always want to remind people, it's capture more, but it's sometimes it's price it less than the back. So it's a holistic strategy right on that dynamic pricing on how do you sell up the house by the time the performers are on stage and that's a holistic perspective that they're getting smarter every day on.
Kyle Evans: The shows where I've seen and have been kind of one to two points of the total seats, where do you think that can go over time, roughly?
Michael Rapino: Yes I think we're obviously a bit higher than that across most of the shows. Clearly, a number of themselves quickly even if their pricing so you may not be seeing the full inventory, but we absolutely see room for that to continue to grow through the first 20% of the house in some cases and also further use of that pricing technology and intelligence to make sure that we're appropriately pricing all the other tickets. The other ones may not be dynamic, but there continues to be additional benefit from taking that - that machine learning, artificial intelligence and applying it to how you price the overall house.
Kyle Evans: Great. Last one, you broke apart the performance of the top 100 artists and the smaller artists and I don't recall you talking about the business that way before. Is that a trend you expect to continue going forward?
Michael Rapino: Yes, for sure. I mean, we've been – Joe and I always get asked that question who's going to be the next superstar and we've been saying it for 10 years that this is a deep business, consumers love going to the Troubadour and the House of Blues as much as the stadium. So we do 8000 club shows a year. Very few investors even acknowledge it or talk about it. We just want to talk about the Asia.So we just wanted to continually remind that at all levels going to a live show is an incredible experience for the fan. And we're seeing more and more club shows, theatres, small shows. You look at things like Springsteen on Broadway, new ideas, new residencies, Madonna going out there this year doing smaller theaters at a higher price.So I think you're just going to see more and more ways, artists will look at traditional venues, smaller venues, unique venues, sizes to keep bringing their art to the consumer in a unique location and that's huge opportunity for us.
Kyle Evans: Great. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to today's presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: All right. Have a great summer. Thank you all.
Operator: Once again, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. My name is Justin, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. 2019 is off to a strong start with our highest first quarter AOI ever at $115 million and with revenue up 17% to $1.7 billion. Our Concerts and Sponsorship segments drove this growth, as both delivered record first quarter revenue and AOI. More importantly, we have now booked enough concerts, sold enough tickets and secured enough sponsorship commitments to be confident that Company will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. We continue to benefit from a global concerts industry that is structurally growing with strong tailwinds for both supply and demand. Our performance is further accelerated by our concert flywheel, driving additional profitable growth in our onsite sponsorship and ticketing businesses. Starting with the concert business, we had almost 15 million fans attend our concerts during the first quarter, up 22% year-on-year, led by our arena and theater shows, which are each up over 1 million fans. As a result, revenue was up 27% and we delivered our first positive AOI Q1 in our concerts business. This sets up the year well and through mid-April, we have sold 49 million for our concerts this year, up 5% year-on-year. At the same time, we have continued shifting to market based pricing, growing the use of platinum tickets. Looking at our front of house tickets, amphitheater pricing is up double digits this year, and both amphitheaters and arenas have seen an increase in pricing of over 30% across the past two years. Even with this improved pricing, we're not seeing any pullback in demand for concerts as sell-through rates continue to be strong globally, across arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums, and from the best seats in the front to the lawn seats at our amphitheaters. As we add fans, we continue to improve our onsite experience, which then drives fan spending. While we are just beginning the amphitheater season, I expect us to once again grow average per fan spending by $2 this year in our amphitheaters. With our global concerts business set to deliver strong AOI growth again, the Concerts segment continues to be the engine that powers the overall growth of Live Nation. In what is typically our lowest activity quarter for Sponsorship, revenue was up 1% and AOI up 2%. Through mid-April, we are pacing double-digits ahead of last year in committed net revenue, reaching over 80% of our target for the full-year I expect our growth to be driven again by our festivals and large strategic sponsors, and we continue adding a number of these new partners, including Verizon in the U.S., Rogers Communications in Canada and Diageo in Europe. As a result, I expect we will deliver double-digit AOI growth in Sponsorship again this year. In the first quarter, Ticketmaster delivered its fourth highest transacted fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, trailing only Q1 2018 and Q4 in 2017 and 2018. While Ticketmaster was impacted in the quarter by a pull forward of onsales into the fourth quarter of 2018, by mid-March those sales trends had turned around, and through mid-April, Ticketmaster has sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than at the same time last year. Putting aside quarterly fluctuations, every metric, including global GTV, ticket sales, clients served, and leading digital ticket functionality, demonstrates that Ticketmaster is the most effective marketplace to sell tickets to fans. Our roadmap at Ticketmaster remains very clear and focused, deploy digital ticketing at scale and establish the foundation for a direct relationship with our fans, which will improve the fan experience, provide opportunities for content, venue operators and sponsors to deliver greater ongoing value to the live event fan. As part of this, we remain on track to have Presence installed at over 500 venues with more than 135 million fans entering via the system this year. And following our successful first year of digital ticketing with the NFL, we are seeing more teams shift to a pure digital model, up to seven teams this year from two last year. In summary, I expect Ticketmaster, for the full-year, to deliver GTV and AOI growth, while significantly expanding our digital ticketing footprint. I am pleased with our first quarter results as a start to what we expect to be another record year in 2019. All of our key indicators speak to continued strong consumer demand for our concerts, our attendance growth in the first quarter, acceptance of market pricing, and solid sales for upcoming shows. As a result, we see an acceleration of our growth in the Q2, with overall AOI increasing in the high-teens and each division delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. The combination of this near-term view plus concert ticket sales for the year, sponsorship commitments, and continued success of the Ticketmaster platform gives us confidence that Live Nation will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full year. With that, I will turn the call over Joe to take you through more additional details.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, Concerts. In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 8,000 concerts for nearly 15 million fans worldwide, increases of 12%and 22%, respectively. Fan growth was strong across both North America and international markets, led in particular by arena, show count and fan growth, along with increased theater activity. Looking to the full-year, we expect to grow our fan base in both North America and internationally with arenas, theaters and clubs and festivals leading this growth. Our international markets are looking particularly strong, driven also by a resurgence of stadium shows for 2019, including such artists as BTS, Ed Sheeran and Metallica. In total, we expect overall fan growth for the year in the mid single-digits, which combined with our pricing initiatives and onsite spending programs we expect will deliver strong double-digit AOI growth for the concert segment. Turning to our Sponsorship and Advertising business. AOI was up 2% for the quarter and revenue was up 1%. Sponsorship is the only segment where we saw material effects impact in the quarter and excluding effects, AOI was up 7% and revenue was up 4%. Given over 85% of our sponsorship is recognized in the second through fourth quarters, it is our committed net revenue that is our most important indicator at this point of the year. And, as Michael indicated, our committed net revenue is up double-digits at over 80% of our target for the year. We're seeing consistent growth with both North America and international markets pacing double-digits ahead of this point last year as our both online advertising and sponsorship. And within Sponsorship, festival sponsorship per fan and revenue from strategic sponsors are both projected to be up double-digits for the year. This broad growth gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of double-digit AOI growth in sponsorship. Finally, Ticketing. Ticketmaster's global GTV in the first quarter with $7.6 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Both primary and secondary ticketing GTV were down similarly and in both cases concerts activity was the main driver. This is consistent with the general sales pattern we see with secondary, where most activity is either immediately following the onsale or in the few weeks leading up to the show. Thereby accelerating concert onsales into the fourth quarter, we have the same impact on secondary sales. As Michael indicated, our digital ticketing deployment is proceeding well and we will evolve it to the next level with the NFL this year shifting to encrypted barcodes as we continue to give content more control over how tickets are sold and managed. One of the key implications of digital ticketing is our ongoing shift to mobile ticketing with mobile ticket sales accounting for 46% of total ticket sales in the quarter and also driving a 40% increase in our installed app base to over 60 million. These app installs are critical as it gives us a real-time channel to our digital fans, enabling teams, artists, the venues and our brand partners to directly reach these fans. As Michael noted, we expect we will see growth in fee-bearing GTV for the full year, which will deliver our full-year AOI growth for ticketing in the mid single-digits. In summary, following a successful first quarter, we're shaping up to accelerate this growth in the second quarter. This starts with increasing concert attendance, particularly in stadiums and theaters during the second quarter. In Q2 results will also benefit from a shift in some of our major festival activity from Q3 into Q2, which helps both Concerts and Sponsorship. Looking at the full-year, given the strength of our leading indicators across Concert, Sponsorship and Ticketing, we are confident that we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full-year in the same range as we have grown over the past several years I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard: Thanks, Joe; and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019, our revenue was up 17% to $1.7 billion, AOI increased 1% to $115 million and, as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.8 billion, up slightly compared to last year. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by Concerts, which grew by 27% as a result of increased activity in arenas and theaters globally, which also then delivered the increase in AOI for the quarter. Overall, our AOI for the first quarter finished stronger than what we had expected a few months ago due to a few items. In Concerts, globally, we had a large number of theater shows that performed strongly and we also saw a shift of some artists performance payments from Q1 into Q2. And in Ticketing, our ticket sales accelerated starting in mid-March, as Michael noted. Our operating loss was $24 million in the first quarter, driven by higher depreciation and amortization along with acquisition-related costs. And our net loss for the quarter was $52 million compared to $34 million in the prior year, as a result of the higher operating loss. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $12 million. For the full year, we currently estimate that this accretion will be approximately $62 million with the remainder for the year fairly consistent across the quarters. For Q1, we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI of about 3%. And based on the rates now, we expect both to be impacted negatively by approximately 1% in the second quarter. Amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances in 2019 is expected to be in line with the last few years of expense. Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, we had total cash of $2.7 billion, including $848 million in client cash and $1.4 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving free cash balance of $382 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $469 million as compared to $775 million last year, impacted by the shift of ticket sales into the fourth quarter of 2018. Free cash flow adjusted was $3 million, driven by the timing of distributions to non-controlling interest. We currently expect that free cash flow, as a percentage of AOI for full year 2019, will be in line with the prior year. Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $62 million with 60% spent on revenue generating items. We currently expect that our capital expenditures for the full-year will be approximately $310 million, with more than half on revenue generating addition. The increase in capital expenditures as compared to last year is driven by Concerts as we continue to expand our venue footprint globally and improve our existing venues to drive fan satisfactions, ancillary spend and sponsorship opportunities. Our total debt, as of March 31st, was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.3%. We implemented the new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2019, so you will see operating lease assets of $1.1 billion and total operating lease liabilities of $1.2 billion on our balance sheet, as of March 31, 2019. These amounts are based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments of our various operating leases globally that have terms greater than one-year. This new lease guidance will not have a material impact to our income statement going forward. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take the first question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is David. As you noted, I think this your first quarter with a positive AOI in Concerts after posting modest losses going back at least to the Ticketmaster merger. How much of this is driven just by scale on higher attendance or there are other factors that have shifted in the business that now you're realizing a positive result in the first quarter.
Michael Rapino: Yes. That's all fundamentally driven by the higher attendance, David. As we said, we're very strong in arenas and theaters for the quarter, record attendance so that drove through to the higher performance, which then was supported by the pricing that we have which has higher flow through and just as we continue to scale the business.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then in the theaters and clubs division, you've been fairly active over the past month in Southern California adding new venues, booking relationships, can you just talk about the strategic extension opportunities that you see in getting scale at such a local level and how much room is there to sort of repeat this strategy in other areas?
Michael Rapino: Yes. David, we've been talking about the diversity of our concert business both geographically, so our goal is to continue to be a global business. There are lots of countries, 42 we're in and many more cities where we want to keep building, whether it's our festival business, our concert business or our venue business. So those releases you see are just continual bolt-ons in markets like San Diego or Los Angeles or London or Paris where we see an opportunity to pick up a great promoter, pick up a venue. And as you know from our financials when we manage the venue, our per head margin increases. So we're always looking for opportunities to bolt-on pieces of the venue or promoter or festival business in markets around the world and you'll see that continue for years to come.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just on your ticketing result, can you say if there are any ongoing data breach expenses in the quarter? Is there any impact to margin at all from rolling out Presence? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I think as we talked about in the last call, we expected to see data breach costs in the high-single millions over the course of this year. So as we also said, we expected that to be primarily in Q1 and Q2, so you do have some of that in this quarter. As it relates to Presence, there's nothing new or different really from a cost standpoint of deploying Presence at this point. It's continuing to roll out some access control systems at the venues, which will be on the capital side, but nothing material on the operational side.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take the next question.
Amy Yong: Good afternoon. This is Amy Young from Macquarie. Maybe just following up on ticketing. What activity drove the turnaround in mid-March and April? Was there anything specific that you can talk about? And then can you update us on the progress that ticketing is making on the international front? And lastly, I think a lot of us understand that there's an option to buy in the remainder of Rock in Rio. Can you help us understand what the puts and takes are for that specific deal? Thank you.
Michael Rapino: Sure. In terms of the turnaround, I think, Amy, more than anything else it was just the catching up of what the pull forward was in Q4 and having that run its course in Q1. We didn't know whether that was going to run its course end of February, end of March, end of April. There was just that uncertainty when we last spoke. So it ended up playing out, but as of the middle of March, this was when we basically saw ourselves work that out of the system. And then that combined with as we thought, it's a very strong theater business, which tended to have a shorter lead time when the shows are announced to onsale to play, also augmented the quarter for us. It was a particularly – speaking then on international, it was a particularly strong quarter for international. That business continues to grow well as we follow the concerts globally and build the business in the markets where we have a strong Concerts Presence and less of a historical Ticketmaster Presence. I don't think we have anything structural to announce at this point, but certainly our strategy remains on course to use the concerts as the flywheel and to have ticketing benefit from that activity. In terms of Rock in Rio, yes, we have got certain options as you said, nothing has been done at this point. I don't think we're in a position to comment on what we're going to do or not do until we make a final determination.
Amy Yong: Got it. And congrats on the quarter.
Joe Berchtold: But we will say, Amy, we're thrilled with the acquisition. Rock in Rio this year is going to have a record year attendance ticket sales profitability. So we've always known that's one of prized jewels in the global festival business, so we're using it. One, we think the festival fabulous, it's got expansion to it and it's been a huge part of our South American entry. So you'll see us do more, invest more in it. It is the general strategy regardless of what day we do what part.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go and take the next caller.
Brandon Ross: Hi, it's Brandon Ross from BTIG. On your mid single-digit AOI growth for tickets that you gave us guidance, what's your assumption for the timing of onsale this year? Do you expect a similar pull forward in Q4 like we saw in Q4 of 2018? And then I have another one.
Michael Rapino: Yes. We've seen sales go earlier and earlier, so I think you'll see more and more activity in Q4 for the following year seems to be the trend in the last couple of years.
Brandon Ross: Okay. And then maybe a follow-up on David's. With your CapEx growth accelerating this year, you've mentioned you're expanding your venue footprint. Can you talk a little more about exactly what types of venues you're investing in and where you're investing in that?
Michael Rapino: Music venues, Brandon. Does that help your model?
Brandon Ross: Amphitheaters, Theaters.
Michael Rapino: Yes. Music venues, right. We have 50 amphitheaters, we love that model, continues to be a high-margin business. It drives sponsorships, drives ticketing, drives our global food and beverage, so you'll see us – if there's opportunities, we'll keep expanding that footprint, both here and around the world. From the 500-seat to 6,000-seat range, I think we have over 200 and something of those venues now. In House of Blues to Fillmore to Europe, we have a strong portfolio, Australia, we do Canada. We see those as a real great sweet spot of upcoming talent. Huge piece of the youth culture, so it drives our sponsorship, our data around that segment, those customers tend to go to shows five, six times versus a higher-end show at the arenas you go two times. So you get a real active young audience when you're in the kind of the 500 to 6,000 seats. They seem to be the new movie theater for every developer. So we have great opportunities to kind of leverage our content for more equity, more revenue, more of the pie in the right development. So I think we're in a really sweet spot where the live theater is a part that a lot of the developers, real estate, neighborhood, city centers they all want that venue to be part of their attraction in urban centers. So we continually have a big opportunity and a long list of options where we will continue to, whether we acquire the lease, whether we manage, whether we book or whether we bill, we think they are good accretive businesses on overall expansion globally.
Brandon Ross: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go and take the next question.
Douglas Arthur: It's Doug Arthur. Joe, you made a comment about the timing of festivals shifting from Q3 to Q2. Is that something – in terms of modeling, is that material? Or is that more sort of on the margin in terms of how it's going to skew the seasonality of the concert sector?
Joe Berchtold: As I mentioned and you can assume it's probably meaningful to think through. We just have a couple of festivals that traditionally sit over those weekends of the end of June, beginning in July. and based on how the weekend falls, it could either goes more into Q2 or Q3. So we're just making sure to point that out, so as you guys do your modeling, you get the balance between Q2 and Q3.
Douglas Arthur: Okay. And then, I mean you guys were quite cautious on the first quarter. We talked about a little bit on this call. It seems like the Ticketing segment kind of in terms of the timing of these onsales kind of did what you thought it would do, Sponsorship and Advertising was pretty swell in the quarter, obviously the buildup is later. So ergo, the big surprise, which I'm surprised it was such a big surprise was in the Concerts segment in terms of very strong revenue growth. I guess when you did your fourth quarter, you do not quite have the visibility on that at the time or how do you see that playing out versus what you've originally expected?
Joe Berchtold: Well, I think, on the Ticketmaster part, as I said on earlier part of the call, we didn't know when that was going to fully work through the Q4 pull forward and how much of it was incremental and how much of it was timing. So until we saw that play out, we didn't know what that was. Now we've now seen it play out, it was on the positive end of the spectrum of what we had hoped for. And as we said, as of mid-July, Ticketmaster has sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than it sold at this point last year. So that was definitely an unknown for us when we did the call in February. Another thing is on the Concert side, I've said a few times that the theater side of the business in particular has been strong and that tends to be shorter lead time. And then I think third is overall we've been very happy with the sell-through rates. As Michael mentioned, they've been very strong. You've listened to other companies' calls and you hear concerns about the economic cycle that was again an unknown to us and I think that having sell-through rates that are at or above last year's across venue type and across ticket types has been something that's given us – maybe still a lot better today than we did a few months ago.
Michael Rapino: And Doug just to jump on that, I think that last point is the fundamental. We were going into a year, we want to make sure that globally, environmentally that there was not – no speed bumps that were going to affect our business. Our sell-through really, really picked up halfway through Q1. We do our annual concert week. I think it's our third or maybe fourth year now. We sold 1 million tickets yesterday, which would have been more than what we would have sold in three days last year. So that is another example of the market is very strong. From club shows to festivals, our European business is very strong. So we are very optimistic now that there is no slow down at all on a global consumer demand perspective. Our business is strong.
Douglas Arthur: All right. Okay. That's very helpful. And then I guess, finally, sort of a nerdy question, but to the extent that you sell more tickets via mobile and via the app, does that improve your data, the granularity of your data, and help you drive sponsorships?
Joe Berchtold: Great question.
Michael Rapino: Best question so far.
Joe Berchtold: So selling tickets on the app, under the historical model, once we've had a material difference in terms of the data we have. As we shift to digital ticketing and we get the identity, when we have all of those individuals identified on data, it gives us, first of all, much better data. Second of all, by having a combination of cellphone numbers and app installs, it enables us to connect with them directly real-time via phone, so whether that's a sponsor, an artist, a team, Ticketmaster marketing it provides a much more effective marketing platform.
Douglas Arthur: Great, okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take another question.
Ryan Sundby: Yes. Hi. Ryan Sundby, William Blair. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. Michael, in the press release, as you called out, you've really done a great job driving front of house, and arenas and amphitheater over the last couple of years. I was just wondering if you can maybe talk about what pricing has looked like at – for the rest of the house. And then maybe tie that in with kind of how your unsold inventory looks today versus kind of what you shared a few years ago in something like 25% of tickets were going unsold?
Michael Rapino: Yes. On kind of our annual Investor Day we do in November. I mean I have those numbers up on the slide again. I can't remember the precise number, but you can go back and look at that. The progress has been there year-over-year. So few factors, one, we just continue and look at the demand on the secondary market over the last few years. As much as we've been increasing the P1, the secondary business has also been growing. So we know there's $8 billion to $10 billion of opportunities still priced outside of the house from a consumer demand perspective. So we know we got years left and we'll be sitting on this call telling you that we've slowly increased the price and it's a slower process, because the artist has to find that right balance between what he will charge that makes sense for his fan and his brand and what the market will bear. That allows us to be some in efficiency, but a great progress. The artists is much more – the appetite is a lot larger now as we’ve moved forward and exceed kind of a sunlight on what the artist or what's these tickets are selling for. So we have a great opportunity to keep pricing upfront. I think we've talked about before. The great advantage of pricing upfront is you also then get some extra growth in the pot to reduce the pricing in the back. A problem in the concert business is never been to sell the first 30 rows, it's can you sell those final 30 rows and get that customer in the house and when they buy a beer and they drive your sponsorship and your data. So one of the reasons you see our revenue and our ticket sales continually grow and we think again this will be a multiyear strategy for us is, we've been able to price the house better in the back, lower the price when it's needed to promote, do some promotions, do what you can, yet net overall the artist is still have a higher gross, higher revenue for the whole house. So a more sophisticated pricing has come into effect, price the front of the house better, price the Tuesday different than a Friday, price the aisle seat different than the middle seat. All of the classic airlines will tell models of dynamic pricing and all of those strategies have been slowly introduced and implemented. It's been driving our overall revenue as well as our throughput on the show. And then once they get in the show, you know all of those things we talked about how we monetize them. So we've been driving more tickets. I think our sell-through we've been talking about closing the gap. Again, we have a multiyear run rate of opportunity ahead, because at the end of the day the majority of shows still don't sell out. So we always have a lot of inventory to keep putting another person through the turnstile and whether it's – at 8:01 that ticket is worth zero. So as long as between the announcement and 7:59, we figured out how to monetize that customer at any price to get him through the door the business continues to move. So we've been moving that number up over the last few years. I think one or two points a year. I think we said in November, we look to that to be a $100 million plus opportunity as we put more people through the house over the next few years by pricing the house better.
Ryan Sundby: Okay, got it. Very helpful. And then I guess in the QIC, you called out higher tuning activity in Asia as a driver of concert growth. Just wondering, if you could, maybe provide just a little more color on where that came from? And then maybe just take a step back and remind us kind of what countries are you materially in today? I mean, as you look over the next five years, kind of what are the big opportunities in Asia to drive growth?
Michael Rapino: I'm not sure where the Asia comment came from. We've been building our global business for years, as you know. We're in 42 markets, where we have a Live Nation office, where we're promoting the show. It is a global bundle of local business. You have to have boots on the ground to actually execute. So if you look at our business on a global perspective, historically our European, Western European, Canada, U.S. and Australia have been the traditional markets of a global business. And you've seen in the last five years, whether it's South America, whether it's Asia or Eastern Europe, we've been slowly building out the infrastructure in those markets. We believe that the – now that the artist is global in terms of when Drake drops a single tomorrow, that 19-year-old in Singapore, Colombia and Cape Town knows about it as well as that one in Detroit. So it is a fast expanding global business. Every major city in the world wants to be an entertainment capital and have Drake perform there. The infrastructure is being built. So you're going to see us continue and be aggressive in Asia, South America, India and Eastern Europe, as those markets are becoming every year more legitimate. I think Asia comment might have been driven by our BTS tour. It's a great success story, we're very proud to be part of that global tour and that might be where the Asia comment came in. Overall, our Asia business is a growing business. We've been in China, Hong Kong and Singapore for years. We've been continually looking to grow those businesses and we will over time.
Ryan Sundby: Perfect. Thanks.
Operator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to you for any additional remarks.
Michael Rapino: All right. Thank you, everybody.
Operator: Well, thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-03-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Live Nation Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to today's speakers. Please go ahead.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. I will make my comments today excluding the 2017 impacts of the $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year comparable. Live Nation delivered its eighth consecutive year of record results. Revenue was up 11%, AOI up 13% and free cash flow up 8%. All our divisions concert sponsors and ticketing delivered their strongest AOI results in the history of the Company. Turning with our concert units. Fans more than ever find the large experience from club shows arenas to, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artist and show the experience with fans. In the U.S. alone, over the past 10 years, consumer spend on live experiences has grown by $5 billion per year, and we believe this ongoing trend will structurally continue to drive increased demand for concerts globally. As a result to the strong demand growth in 2018 we delivered double digit attendance growth across our arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs. Continuing to grow our global market share, adding nearly 7 million fans globally for total 93 million fans, driving concert revenue up 11% and AOI up 22%. Across all of the artists we work with, we invested over $6 billion to promote 35,000 shows in 40 countries with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artist and music. In addition to growing our show count and attendance, our pricing and onsite initiatives also continue to grow our AOI. Average ticket prices for our amphitheaters and arena shows increased by 13% in 2018 as part of the house pricing was up over 20%. Overall, across all our shows, price increases delivered over $350 million to artist who effectively captured more the value from shows. Once at the show average per fan spend grew as well, our amphitheaters spent grew by $3 to $27 per head as we added more high-end products, improve the quality of our food and beverage, and increase the revenue we earned from parking and service fees. The strength of our business is continuing to 2019 with ticket sales for shows this year up double-digits through mid-February, along with similar increases and confirmed amphitheater, arena and stadium show count. With this growth and our plans to further monetize our fan relationship, I expect this to translate to continued strong growth at concerts with AOI in 2019. In our high-end sponsorship business, we grew both revenue and AOI by 13% in 2018. Our top strategic sponsors have been a key driver of this growth with 75 sponsors collectively spending over 350 million to reach our fans up 11% over 2017. Sponsorship at our festivals grew 13%. This growth was driven by new deals with brands including Heineken, Barclays, State Farm and Frito-Lay. All of this reinforces the power of our platform of 93 million fans, and the continued shift by brands to invest in reaching fans during the live experience. Research from our Power of Live white paper indicates that over 90% of fans believe that brands can enhance the live experience and over 60% of fans believe they are more likely to connect with brands at concerts. This reinforces that our shows offer brands a truly unique opportunity to connect with fans. With over 70% of our budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year already committed, pacing double-digits ahead of this time last year, we are confident we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth in 2019. Ticketmaster continued growing its leadership position in ticketing in 2018, with fee-bearing GTV up 14% and total platform GTV up 33 billion. This drove a 14% increase in ticketing revenue and AOI of 7%. Our top priority at Ticketmaster in 2018 was deploying our TM presence product, which we see as our key for effectively unlocking the value of our customer relationships across our ticketing, concerts and sponsorship businesses. By the end of 2018, we deployed presence in over 200 venues, operating 20,000 events for 40 million fans, approximately half of whom used digital tickets. We see our deployment in 2019 further accelerating, and we are expecting to have presence in over 500 venues by the end of the year, with over 125 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will cover over 75% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital ticketing. At the same time, we continue build our marketplace, with the fourth quarter being our highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets in a quarter for the first time, and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. Overall in 2018, Ticketmaster managed over 400,000 events, delivering almost 500 million tickets in 28 countries. We continue adding new clients to our marketplace, who collectively added over 10 million new tickets in 2018. I believe we have tremendous opportunity for growth on a global basis, particularly in the 13 markets where we promote concerts but do not yet have a substantial ticketing operation. In 2018, we furthered our international expansion, establishing ticketing operations in Italy, ramping up our German operations and laying the groundwork for expansion in Latin America. Ticketmaster continues to exceed expectations, both operationally and in its leadership position in digital ticketing, along with its ability to expand that leadership position globally and deliver continued profitable growth. In summary, 2018 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and thereby driving growth in our high margin venues, sponsorship and ticketing businesses. We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong consumer demand, the robust supply of new and established artists hitting the road and clubs, and stadium. Live is truly a unique entertainment firm, it cannot be duplicated and create lifetime memories, the fans are creating more than ever this experience economy. We believe the live business will continue to have strong growth for years to come as fans globally drive demand artists of touring more and more an onsite spending sponsors and ticketing all benefit from the concerts flywheel. In 2019, I expect it to further grow our global concert position while enhancing onsite hospitality and capturing more pricing opportunities. In sponsorship, we will continue to drive double digit growth is more brands look for that direct connection with music fans. And ticketing continue to transform to a truly digital ecosystem, it will benefit from continued growth in concert ticket sales and further expansion of our global footprint. We believe that the combination of macro trends and our demonstrated ability to execute are strong indicators of our ability to continue to grow the business for many years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first concerts as Michael said, in 2018, we grew attendance by 8% to a record 93 million fans promoting 19 of the top 25 global tours. As we have talked about over the past year, 2018 was a very strong year for arenas and theaters in theaters and clubs with all three building types of double digits in attendance. Globally, we also continue growing our festival portfolio, adding seven festivals to give us a global portfolio of 104 festivals in 14 countries. As a result we increase festival attendees by 6% to nearly 9 million fans and now have 29 festivals that each attracted over 100,000 fans last year. Looking geographically, North America was the primary driver of our fan growth while internationally to stick with lower stadium attendance offset much of their strong arena and festival attendance growth. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter attendance and show count were up our AOI was lower, heavily driven by a $15 million a year on year increase in advertising expense related to 2019 shows. This increased advertising spend representative of a continued shift earlier on sales and is also one of the reasons we are optimistic about 2019 concert activity. For 2019, as Michael said we are already seen strong growth and ticket sales for shows this year. Sales are particularly strong in our international markets, which we expect to continue through the year with North America also expected to keep growing. We see growth across all buildings types in 2019 with arenas globally amphitheaters and North American and stadiums internationally, all contributing to the increase. Along with our fan growth, we will also be continuing our focus on pricing optimization and onsite monetization in 2019. On pricing, with over 2000 arena and amphitheater shows already on sale, we are seeing high single digit increases in front of house pricing, which I expect to continue to expand throughout the year. While on site monetization won't start until the summer season, it remains a priority to continue our growth of the past few years with teams already working on specific amphitheater by amphitheater plans. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In 2018, we again delivered double digit AOI growth, up 13% this year. This performance was reflective of strength across the board. North America and international sponsorship businesses were both up double-digits, and both sponsorship and online advertising also grew double-digits. For the fourth quarter, revenue was a 20% and AOI was at 16%. We saw particularly strong growth in our festivals in the fourth quarter including Austin City Limits and Voodoo while also launching a number of major programs for sponsors including Google, Sony, Pepsi Uber and T Mobile. As we get into 2019, we expect to again deliver double-digit AOI growth of the year. As Michael indicated, we are pacing double-digits ahead of this time last year, and based on our current discussions with brands, we are expecting strong growth in our basis strategic sponsors as well as our on-site sponsorship particularly at festivals. Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was up 7% for the quarter and up 8% for the full year, driven by Fee-Bearing GTV, which was up 12% and 14% for the quarter and year respectively. Primary GTV, which accounts for almost 90% of overall Fee-Bearing GTV was up 12% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Secondary GTV was up 6% for the quarter and up 16% for the full year. As we continue to take share in the North America secondary market. Throughout 2018, we continue to improve our mobile and app experiences, which is critical for our digital strategy. We grow our app install base by 40% year-over-year give me this much greater reach for direct can relationships. In sales of tickets via mobile devices continue to grow rapidly, up 35% for the year and accounting for over 40% of overall ticket sales. For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was down slightly impacted by one-time costs associated with the third-party vendor data breach that affected our marketplace in certain international markets. Much of these costs were in the fourth quarter and for the full year these one-time cost totaled approximately $15 million. To preempt the question on margins, obviously, these data breach costs at a material impact on our 2018 margins. The majority of the remaining margin impact comes from two other factors. First, as Michael indicated, we're continuing to invest and expanding Ticketmaster's global footprint and we expect in any start-up market will have below average margins for a period of time as it scales. These markets are generally rapidly AOI positive given our ability to get an allocation applied nation concert tickets, but initially at below average margins. Secondly, as we continue to get more effective a data driven marketing, we're spending more to grow our GTV. To be clear, the GTV from free visits continued growing in 2018. The paid marketing driven GTV grew even faster. As a result, margins were impacted despite the attractive profitability of the incremental GTV generated via this paid marketing. So in summary, 2018 was a great year across all of our businesses; and in 2019, we expect to continue growing all the businesses. From a stadium standpoint, we see our growth continuing to be delivered primarily in the second, third quarters, as most of our concert investments will be playing out in those quarters. The first and fourth quarters each account for less than 10% of our annual AOI, meaning that they will also have to absorb increase fixed costs associated with our overall growth against seasonally lower activity. On FX, we ended up with a negligible impact on AOI and revenue for 2018 and at this point we see very little impact on 2019. I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon everyone. I will start with our key highlights for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased by 12% to $2.6 billion, AOI was $69 million compared to $87 million in 2017, after adding back in $110 million legal accrual recorded in 2017. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.1 billion, up 35% from the $816 million last year. Concerts with a 12% increase contributed the majority of the revenue growth in the quarter from increased arena and theater and club activity. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 20% from higher sponsor and online activity in North America, and ticketing revenue increase 15% from higher primary ticket volume. Fourth quarter AOI was lower in concerts due to the $15 million increase in advertising expense for 2019 shows that Joe mentioned. Sponsorship and advertising delivered 16% growth in an AOI with higher online advertising in North America and growth in sponsorships internationally. Our operating loss was $90 million in the quarter, essentially flat to last year after adjusting for the legal accrual. The net loss for the quarter was $148 million compared to a loss of $137 million in the prior year, before the legal accrual and $56 million tax benefits related to tax reform changes in 2017. For the 2018 school year revenue was $10.8 billion an 11% increase over 2017.AOI was $829 million for the full year, and up 13% over our 2017 AOI $735 million before the legal accrual. Free cash flow Jessica was $481 million up 8% over last year without the legal accrual, or 58% of AOI for the year. Other segments delivered double digit growth in revenue for 2018. The majority of the increase was driven by concerts up, 11% from increase show account and attendance across arenas, amphitheaters in theaters and clubs. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 13% from growth in online advertising and sponsorship programs globally. And ticketing revenue increased by 14% from higher primary ticket volume driven by concerts along with increased secondary sales. Concerts AOI was up 22% as a result of more events and fans, across arenas, amphitheaters festivals in theaters and clubs and higher ancillary revenue per fan and or amphitheaters, Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew by 13% in line with this higher revenue and ticketing AOI grew 7% without the 2017 legal accrual, delivering growth in both primary and secondary ticket sales. Although impacted by the cyber investigation costs incurred this year that Joe noted. Operating income was $273 million, up 35% over last year before the legal accrual driven by our strong AOI growth. Our net income for the year was $60 million as compared to $48 million in 2017 before the legal accrual and the 2017 tax reform related tax benefit. We recorded $78 million of accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest in 2018. We currently expect this accretion to be approximately $45 million for 2019 which will be consistently spread across the quarters. We expected amortization of non-repeatable ticketing contract advances in 2019 will be in line with the last few years of expense. Turning to our balance sheet. As of December, we had total cash of $2.4 billion, including 859 million and ticketing client cash, and 903 million in net concert event related cash. Leading free cash balances $610 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was 942 million as compared to 624 million last year with the increased driven by our higher event related deferred revenue. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $251 million, roughly half of which were spent on revenue generating items. For 2019, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million, with a similar split to this year for revenue generating expenditures. Our total net debt as of December 2018 was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.2%. Thank you for joining us today and we will now open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong: So I guess two questions. One, one for Joe first, when you talk about ticketing and expanding into international markets. How quickly do you think the margins on those fronts can match that on the U.S. side? And I guess, Michael, a lot of us remember from the Liberty Analysts Day, hitting -- the Live Nation hitting a 125 million attendees. What does that assume in terms of M&A and organic growth? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold: Amy thanks. So here with regard to the international market. So the first thing remember on the international market is currently the fee structure is fairly different on average in the U.S. Your typical service fee in the U.S. is around 20%. Your typical service fee internationally is around 10%. So we talked in the past that one of the factors that we have going on as we reviewing thought our international markets. Again profitable market adding to our AOI and cash generation, they’re structurally today at a lower margin on average than the U.S. market. And while we see some level of convergence overtime, don't expect that to shift quickly. Each of the markets in terms of its maturation all has, hard to give you a one size fits all. But as I said, they do become AOI positive pretty quickly with our concert allocations and then we grow it from there.
Michael Rapino: Amy, it's Michael, I'll jumping on TM. The one thing to think about also on ticketing outside of North America, it's probably, let's call it 15 years behind the U.S. model was so advanced on a closed platform and just increasing service fees every dollar for 20 years. International, we see great growth in that, some of those markets may only have $2 service fees today, but they all have great pricing potential for the next 10 years. So a lot of these markets today are lower so to speak, there they literally are still distributing over the local bank and we have a retail strategy converting to online. But we also see international has a great opportunity to that is where we actually have great pricing power. And every year we're seeing the service fee going up to reflect kind of closer to the U.S. model overtime. So great profit pool to grow internationally outside the U.S. Canada. And Amy starting second question and Michael can chip in. The question that has grown 125 million fans from our 93 million fans M&A versus organic. The complexity here again with us is we will often use M&A to enter a market buying local to be relatively small, promoter one who's well established that market. And then we can on our engine of 80 tours that we're buying on to that area. So whether we're talking about a local market here in North America or promoter down in Argentina, we rapidly grow organically off of that initial platform that we're purchasing. So we end up with 70% 80% organic growth as a result, but we but we do use absolute M&A for that initial entry point. Yes actually let me took the words out. I mean, we historically have had a fairly balanced model, well over 30 of our business to be acquiring more tourists globally and three markets on our own and growing the overall business by showing more tickets to the current tour, and then we selectively on bolt-on still look at the global opportunity of a fragmented industry. I think we use that 30% global market share. So we'll continue to bolt on, there's a few chunk here ones we would look to acquire to Excel that and organic. And those three combinations are how we grew over the last five, six years and we think will continue to execute both runway on bolt on and an organic.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Bazinet: A quick question on the secondary ticketing market. You mentioned you're gaining share. Do you mind just giving us a quick snapshot of sort of how big that market is and major players are? And how your how you think you're being successful taking share so far?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. So, we're getting some pretty specific numbers that are last Liberty presentation. So I'll try to remember all of those numbers. So, I think what we did say is the secondary industry over the past several years has been growing at a pretty good clip, frankly, faster than we have been growing our ticket prices. And so we think there continues to be over $1 billion price arbitrage that exists in our concert tickets alone. And if you look at the marketplace, we obviously have a two headed strategy. One strategy is to create a compelling product on Ticketmaster that offers but the primary. And secondary tickets, the other strategy which is at least as important is to continue to get more effective at that initial primary ticket pricing and transfer as much of the economics as possible into the artists pocket which can use to track down to tour more and be out there generating more sales more bands for our overall flywheel strategies. So going forward, I think it would be our expectation that we would see rest growth certainly in the secondary market as we continue to focus on that primary prices, I think that the competitors in the space are pretty well known, obviously stuff in the United States. But, for us it's really a matter of how do we continue to best serve dollars and the fans for the right products.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brandon Ross with BTIG.
Brandon Ross: Maybe following up on, Amy, a little bit, you did a number of international acquisition since Q4 started, I think 9. And you mentioned strengths next year being driven by international. Are we now at a point where you see international becoming the real growth engine of the Company? And maybe you could talk about what markets you're investing in internationally and why? And then I have a follow up.
Michael Rapino: I'll start and Joe can fill in some pieces. I don't think we've done anything that we haven't been actually done for a while. We still believe that the U.S. Canadian market, let's put those two together. still have growth ahead. We are still under servicing in markets as we've talked before about. We serve a lot of opportunities to build one of our businesses and a lot of in the A market. We have low market share in a lot of big market. So U.S. still has great potential, we still think sponsorship is a double-digit growth business in America. And we see, I think the concert business continues to be on-site hospitality, real estate expansion and incredible frothy opportunity in the U.S. So it's not an easier either. We continue to execute with great confidence that it's you can invest in America. But we absolutely have always said that it's a global business and as we build out the pipe in 40 countries, and we look at all the other cities around the world where we have no market share or learn. As we put in the best promoter in a ticketing platform and our global concert which then follow usually sponsorship in ticketing, we have that model down in major cities and when we got those 3 to 4 legs of that still in Milan and Cape Town and real, we know we can build $10 million to $20 million business. So we think our whole bunch of opportunities international where we don't have the four legs we might have one leg, that's why you see us by a festival in a major market and major promoter in a different market. As we fill up the legs, great opportunity organically will happen to our scale. So we'll be doing that for the next 5 to 10 years. We'll be talking about 30% market share and lots of opportunity to build International Business platform. It's behind America and a lot of the ways I just mentioned on ticketing. So, we see it probably as a higher growth potential from unsophisticated in both sponsorship ticketing and venue development. So all 3 of those, you'll see our opportunities over the years called about the apparatus we want to get built to consistent demand that we know is we had a console anywhere and that's the part to makes our model unique. So continue to grow international that'll be a great start for us, for many years to come with diverse enough now, but the certain market is having a good or bad day will be okay and have enough risk aversion. And the U.S. will continue to have a deeper bench to grow on ourselves.
Brandon Ross: And then I was wondering if you can take us through your current real estate strategy. You have per cap of significantly over the past few years and the Company is gotten bigger with more balance sheet capacity. With that in mind, do you expect to accelerate the growth of over no venues over the coming years?
Michael Rapino: Yes. I think I would frame it slightly different than -- I really don't recall all five of your questions Brandon is that the --
Joe Berchtold: You only get 2 out of 6.
Brandon Ross: Some housekeeping if you like.
Michael Rapino: No that's fine. No, it's a valid point. We absolutely see a huge opportunity. If you look at our core business model, I'm sure people are sick of the phrase and I do appreciate the book you enrich of let me patent from flywheel long before any other businesses nailed that one. So, yes, we have a big flywheel of concerts and we're going to wake up every year, finding new adjacent businesses that we can monetize because of the flywheel. And no one in the world has 30,000 shows and 100 million people walking in the door. So that's why we believe in the U.S. and onward with its endless growth opportunities. One of them happens to be the venue, the real estate. For many years, we were happy to putting our content in someone else's venue and getting a ticket free and inserting ticket to the door. A lot of the times as we've said in our in our different analysts meetings, when the content ends up in my amphitheater or my festival, or my theater and club, we even make more money because we're now counting more revenue streams. And we look now at the real estate market in America, the advantage we have is there's way more real estate to their artists. And if you are a developer right now, with a shopping mall to a development site, you no longer are probably asking the movie theater to be your tenant you probably come in a Live Nation saying, I'd love to build a 2,000 seat or 4,000seat to 6,000 seat. I'd love to be part of our development because that's the vibrant part of the experience we're creating. So what we're doing now is when those meetings happen and say we're not happy just to ticket until you're building, we want to have equity value in that position and operate and run it to maximize all of the value that can be created from our $6 million a year. So instead of maybe paying somebody millions a year to reach their building to run it while we fill it, there are times we're going to look at hero strategies and real estate where our content is the entire reason the building is being financed for the building is growing in value. We should capture not just the content, not just the food and beverage, but the equity value of the real estate holdings overtime too. So, we're seeing more and more opportunities where our flywheel is putting us in a position to do have some equity ownership and control and some great assets that are completely down the middle completely down the line of a concert live venue. And you'll see us explore more of being more leverage in our content.
Brandon Ross: Okay, just for you. I'm going have to ask a quick short term one. As far as more date quite well at the box, should we expect this to contribute in 2019 is as you recognized downstream revenues from that sale?
Michael Rapino: Well, it will be our first time with movie accounting. So, we’ll see what audits look like, but I would say in just in general, we are thrilled with this division. It's another I just mentioned it earlier, we have scale, we have artist relationships, great stories to be told. So, we started a new division organically. I think we've done five now we've probably got 10 to 15 projects in the pipeline of artists are telling great live stories or movies or documentaries or festival stories or et cetera. So we think that's division is obviously a much higher margin business from the conscious space. It's a low capital intensive business but ultimately is a great marketing platform for artists our shows and Artist Nation division. So we think, we're not really working 2019, it will be a small overall contribution to our agenda in AOI. Overtime, I think it's a like Artist Nation, we think it's a nice high margin ancillary business to our core mission that will be a positive impact. But ultimately, we’ll make AOI to be positive much like we learned with Artist Nation and others, they also end up feeding mother ships. So, Artist Nation, star is born is probably the single greatest marketing exercise we could have did for our sponsorship division. If you are in that division, those kind of things just really setting the flywheel very high and get you in the CMO meeting and other conversations that you hadn't been before. So, we're looking at the pieces always in the end of ancillary business, get us one more tour, one more sponsor or one more ticketing contract and make high margins AOI, it’s a triple win.
Operator: We'll go next to David Karnovsky with JP Morgan.
David Karnovsky: Just on ticketing, in the release you’ve mentioned growth drivers is concert sales and expansion of a global footprint. I was wondering, if you can provide any commentary on the sport side and how you do that contributing in 2019?
Michael Rapino: Sure, I mean, the sport side is obviously key historical foundation to the ticketing business. As we talk sports is also on friendly more static level. There aren't -- there's not a lot of growth in terms of the number of teams or number of games played in the season for the major sports. So, it's really been the concerts business that is driven great growth over the past several years of ticketing. Again, we've given this statistic several times around 80 percentage of fee-bearing GTV growth coming from the concert business. So, it's critical on the support side as they built incredible arenas or stadiums. They're looking to continue to sell those buildings every night, just not just when the games are playing. Those provide platforms for the tours, the artists that we work with, they continue to put on more shows. And it's putting on those more shows that we've been able to grow the business. So, it's not the sports directly, it's the sports indirectly, that's been unlock have a lot of Ticketmaster's growth.
David Karnovsky: And then just on the leading indicators, I think in event deferred revenues up 35%, though you did mention early on sales this year. Just wondering, how to think about that number maybe on a like-for-like basis assuming more consistent on sale periods?
Michael Rapino: I mean, that's the challenge. You can't assume consistent on sale because there's no exactness to that. We said that we're up double-digits in terms of concert events and tickets sold through mid-February. So that to us is the key leading indicator that we're off to a good start for this year.
Operator: We'll go next to Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs.
Drew Borst: I want to ask about Ticketmaster presence and see, if you'd be willing to put some parameters around. What type of contribution to AOI could come from presence over 2019? Or maybe even, what kind of contribution it provided in the fourth quarter as you scale that business?
Michael Rapino: The economics for us of presence versus other systems, digital tickets versus paper tickets is the same economics for us. So, it's not going to be a direct impact on the AOI. Ultimately, what it is by increasing the volume of data, the quality of data that we have on every fan and then on their behavior, the increased ability to reach out on target, interact with those fans while they're on site because of that digital connection will unlock our sponsorship and the value of those 93 million fans that we have for the brands. And we will unlock our ability to better market, create products, and ultimately convert those fans into additional purchases. So, it's not directly the presence rollout itself.
Drew Borst: Okay. And then as a follow up, yes, I noticed that a recent announcement of SMG, which is a big venue operator their form a joint venture with AEG. I was wondering if you could just talk about whether that was sort of impact that may or may not have on your business> I think if I'm not mistaken, SMG is it to the Ticketmaster customer right now, but maybe you can just talk about it, if it has any impact and then maybe broader strategically what it means?
Michael Rapino: Yes, it has no impact on our day-to-day business. We're not facing in the conference center management business it's a scale venue management business, that's not what we do. But between the two of them the building that they do have, we have an existing Ticketmaster contract with SMG. We feel they’re buildings the ones that are Manchester et cetera. And we received a call the minute that was a public announcement from them to reassure us to fill the buildings and ticketing their businesses a huge strategic imperative of theirs. And we've always looked at AEG facilities, our SMG as partners. They all need us to put more shows and fill those venues that they're managing. And they have all probably experiment elsewhere and ended up realizing Ticketmaster also happens to sell them the most tickets. They're managing those buildings for someone else generally. That someone else doesn't care about competition they care about results. So the reason we're the largest supplier the AEG's facility business or SMG or others just because it's good business for both of us. So they're not a business to run will continue to be a good supplier to them. And in return I would assume a ticketing partner forward. So no effect from us, continue to think that we'll grow our business equally well. And we've been growing it in both of those companies over the last five years.
Operator: We'll go next to David Joyce with Evercore.
David Joyce: A question on the venue types and the volume of shows, there was an impact on the fourth quarter and having fewer stadium events. How should think about it this year in terms of size of venues and what that should do for margins on the concert side, and if you could have any visibility on that impact quarterly? And then secondarily on Rock and Rio, just wanted to think about how that will impact you financially this year. I now it bridges two quarters later in the year and what are your thoughts on expanding that again, as that festival has done in the past?
Michael Rapino: So, I'll take the three or four part venue question, David. So one of the things we said is that growth this year is expected, and amphitheaters in North America and the arenas globally and stadiums internationally. Last year, we grew our amphitheaters in North America and you saw, if you want to talk about margin benefiting concert simply because you have all of those food and beverage and other ancillary per fan revenue streams directly associated with our amphitheater business as we talked about that's the most profitable and when we can monetize them, and all those rates in our own buildings. So that helps the overall margin if you will, I don't, because as we told you many times in the past, but we don't obsess on margin. We obsess on growing the AOI, I couldn't tell you the exact margin ramifications certainly not by quarter. But I can tell you that I do expect us to benefit and continue to grow in AOI ff the amphitheaters and their continued growth. And that's largely in Q2 and Q3 period. And then you'll see the same with festivals as we continue to grow our festival business. Again, benefiting from those attractive on side standing against Q2, Q3, so a lot of the benefits from the concert growth will continue to see all primarily in the second, third quarters.
David Joyce: And then on the Rock in Rio, how that should impact you this year and do you have plans yet for how you would be alternating and other markets like Las Vegas or Portugal residents been done before?
Kathy Willard: So on Rock in Rio, I think it was outlined in the 8-K pretty clearly. But we do not consolidate that at this point. So it's equity earnings when the event happens.
Michael Rapino: And there aren't, again the plans that are out there have been announced, they're the events in Brisbane. No other event has been announced at this point.
Operator: We'll go next to Ryan Sundby with William Blair.
Ryan Sundby: Michael, you talk about adding more stores to international markets. I guess in the 13 markets where you promote shows that don't have ticking operations yet. Is there a common kind of barrier that exists that that keeps you out of those?
Michael Rapino: No, no. It's just been in our resources time execution. We have a prioritized list and the first 3 or 4 years that we bought Ticketmaster, we had 14 platforms. So, a lot of what, we’re just getting all of our backend enterprise platform rebuilt. So, we could move into new markets was a common platform just adjusted for currency and taxes and retail. So, we have a robust platform now and we're just rolling out market-by-market in our prioritize list. It's just people, energy and time to get it done no companies exists with the, we have a big enough market share on a global basis that would inhibit it. They’re usually local operators or local ticketing companies, they may have a leadership position, but our content usually lets us come in with a strong position. So, what is they’ll able to see us adding market-by-market and are building within the markets were in brick by brick over the next few years.
Ryan Sundby: And then on presence, how micro can you go with that? Is the 500 venues and 75% major sports in 5 buildings? Is that a big chunk of it or are you pushing this down to the club level over that couple of years? So just curious how far you can go with that?
Michael Rapino: Absolutely, we foresee this becoming the standard of our access control entry and how it is we distribute and manage tickets. So, the focus is getting the large ones first which stand drives Paul, the Ticketmaster for the adoption as opposed to be out there trying to push it everywhere, but starting with Live Nation from amphitheaters to clubs and theaters. And they're major sports team and then going in wildest possible from there. It's a same thing as Michael just saying, it's just matter of prioritization execution to get done all of them.
Operator: And we'll go next to Doug Arthur with Huber Research.
Doug Arthur: Just understand the fourth quarter a little bit better. Kathy, you had 15 million step up in marketing which you've highlighted in the third quarter. And the bulk of the 15 million on the data breach was in the fourth quarter. So is that a fair way to look at it? And then, are we done on these? Or is the marketing going to continue for a while?
Kathy Willard: So, yes, it’s a fair way to look at on the fourth quarter, but I mean we market every show, right. So, the normal accounting for show accounting is that the advertising expense is the expense when the show happens expect at year-end, that we have to expense anything that's on the balance sheet for future shows. So, you're always going to have that effect every fourth quarter just like we have.
Michael Rapino: And, Doug, that's a good think. Like you want that number to be high, which we don't spend marketing unless we have the show. So, the good news is that you look at that number and say than they have a lot of show went on sale that will monetize in '19. So which is an accounting we have to actually true it up at the end of the year.
Kathy Willard: And then on the investigation, cost investigation continues, that we would expect to have some level of expenses in 2019. We just haven’t given you specifics on that.
Doug Arthur: Okay.
Michael Rapino: Don’t expect it to be somewhat less than the $15 million at this point in the millions, but it will still continue and won't be material on the similar things. End of Q&A
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions at this time. So I'm turning the call back over to our speakers, for additional or closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: Thank you everybody. We'll talk to you soon.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Live Nation had its best quarter ever and we are on track to deliver another record year of results across revenue, AOI and free cash flow. For the quarter, revenue was up 11% and AOI was up 16%. And year-to-date, revenue was up 11%, AOI up 17%, and free cash flow was up 22%. All our divisions, Concerts, Ticketing and Sponsorship, each delivered their strongest quarterly AOI results ever. Our Concerts business is our flywheel, attracting over 33 million fans to shows globally in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year which then drove record results in our onsite Ticketing and Sponsorship business. Through October, we have sold 85 million tickets for concerts in 2018, up 6% year-on-year, and we were on track to sell over 90 million tickets this year. With our strength in concert attendance growing, we're also seeing similar success in our onsite Sponsorship and Ticketing business, giving us confidence that 2018 will be another year of record results for Live Nation overall and for each of our divisions. Starting with our Concerts division, it continued to show strong global demand for Concerts through the third quarter. We drove an 8% increase in attendance to 71 million fans attending over 24,000 shows across 40 countries, driving revenue up 11% and AOI up 29% year-to-date. We have also grown our show count by 17% year-to-date to 24,000 shows, at the same time we have increased the revenue generated by each show through pricing optimization. Across arenas and amphitheaters, our average ticket price is up 14%, driven by front of house pricing which is up 25%. Collectively, these increases have grown artist revenue by over $300 million across roughly 6,000 shows. This summer, we also saw growth onsite to our hospitality initiatives at our amphitheaters, increasing our average revenue per fan by nearly $3 to almost $27. This is an increase of more than $6 per fan over the past three years as we have driven substantial improvements across our food and beverage, VIP, and parking programs. With the success of our Concerts flywheel, we're promoting more shows for more fans, more effectively pricing and selling tickets, and delivering a better fan experience than ever before. As a result, we will spend over $6 billion producing concerts this year, making Live Nation far and away the largest financial partner to musicians. In our high-margin Sponsorship business, we have continued our double-digit growth this year, with revenue up 11%, and AOI up 12% year-to-date as we delivered our best quarterly results ever for Sponsorship business. With 1,000 sponsors across our on-site and online platforms, Live Nation is the global leader in music sponsorship, providing brands with an opportunity to reach our core millennial audience as we again add new branded partners this quarter including T-Mobile, Sony, Pennzoil, Sterling wine, and Subway. On-site continues to be a key growth driver, and year-to-date our festival Sponsorship business was up 12% as we continue to find innovative ways to scale and connect brands with nearly 9 million fans attending over 100 festivals worldwide. Other key growth initiative is deepening and broadening our strategic brand relationships with now over 70 sponsors investing on our platform across multiple fronts. Collectively, the committed spend by this group is up 13% to nearly $350 million for the year, accounting for approximately 75% of our overall Sponsorship & Advertising revenue. With over 95% of our expected Sponsorship revenue for the year now contracted, we are confident we will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. Ticketmaster continues building its position as the global ticketing marketplace leader, with 15% growth year-to-date in global fee-bearing GTV, driving revenue growth of 13%, and AOI growth of 11%.. Ticketmaster will deliver almost 500 million tickets worth approximately $31 billion GTV across 28 countries this year, making it the world's largest such marketplace. And the success of our marketplace is stronger than ever, as all three quarters in 2018 have been amongst the top five quarters ever for recognized GTV. During the third quarter, we continued our Presence digital ticketing rollout to NFL stadiums and many Live Nation buildings, bringing the install base to 177 venues. In the third quarter at these venues, we held over 1,500 events with over 3 million fans using mobile tickets for entry. We proved out the scalable capability of mobile ticket in the quarter with as many as 97% of the fans for some NFL games entering via mobile. For the fourth quarter, we expect digital ticketing growth to continue with another 10 million fans across 2,000 events, approximately 5 million of whom will enter using mobile tickets. The move to digital ticketing has meant that sports teams, venues and artists have much greater control over the ticket, enabling them to better control distribution, and ultimately the chain of custody for the tickets. Overall, Ticketmaster's results are validating our dual strategy of delivering a great marketplace for fans to buy tickets while providing the greatest enterprise tools to venues, teams and artists looking to control their tickets and maximize the value of their events. By continuing to do both effectively, I expect us to deliver high single-digit growth in Ticketing AOI this year. As we approach the end of 2018, we are confident that our strong performance will deliver another record year of top line AOI and free cash flow. All of our businesses, Concerts, Sponsorship and Ticketing have delivered growth year-to-date, and based on this key operating metrics, we expect each to deliver record revenue and AOI for the full year. As we look forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue the global consolidation from our Concerts and Ticketing businesses and further growth in Sponsorship and Ticketing from the concerts' flywheel. With that, I will turn our call over to Joe to take you through more additional details on the divisional performance.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue in the third quarter was up 12%, and AOI was up 30%. This was the best quarter in Live Nation Concerts history with 33 million fans attending 7,700 shows, delivering fan growth of 3.6 million in this quarter alone and bringing our fan growth for the year to-date to 5.4 million. Overall, our ticket sales for shows this year has accelerated over the past three months, increasing from 4% growth back in July to now being at 6% growth for October. All parts of this business continue to do well led by our top global tours, including five tours that have each sold over a million tickets this year, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Kevin Hart (08:53), Justin Timberlake, Pink and Bruno Mars. And for the quarter, our arena and amphitheater shows were the largest growth driver, each adding 5.2 million fans in the quarter. At the same time, our show counts and fan base (09:08) our festivals and theaters and pubs while we had our second strongest stadium year ever trailing only last year. Looking at the fourth quarter, we see continued strong performance in our North America arena and theater and club shows, while internationally we are comping a very strong Q4 last year that had unusually heavy touring activity with U2, Coldplay and Bruno Mars all out. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. Sponsorship & Advertising revenue for the third quarter grew by 8% and AOI was up 8% as well. Our growth for the year has been strong across both Sponsorship and online Advertising businesses with both growing revenue and AOI in the double digits year-to-date. And from a geographic perspective, both our North America and International markets have contributed similarly to our Sponsorship growth, while North America has driven our online advertising growth. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 8% and AOI was up 1%. Global GTV was up 3% for the quarter and 7% year-to-date, driven by fee-bearing GTV which was up 13% and 15% for the quarter and year-to-date respectively. Primary GTV was up 13% for the quarter and 14% year-to-date, and secondary GTV was up 11% for the quarter and is now up 22% year-to-date. As in the past, concerts, and particularly Live Nation concerts, are the largest growth driver of our Ticketing business. Ticketmaster remains first and foremost the world's top ticketing marketplace for artists, sports teams and venues to sell tickets to their fans with primary ticketing representing over 90% of our global GTV, and only approximately 2% of our concert tickets and 4% of our sports tickets are resold on our secondary platform. Michael gave you an update on the success we're having with our digital ticketing rollout, and at the same time we're continuing to see an overall shift in ticket sales to our mobile platform. We sold 45% of our tickets in the third quarter on mobile with sales up 37% year-on-year as we increased mobile visits by 27% and grew our app downloads by 30% to over 50 million. These results make it clear that the tickets have made the shift to mobile, giving us even greater confidence that digital ticketing will be rapidly adopted. Finally, our open distribution strategy continued selling more tickets for clients off-platform, up 23% with almost 12 million tickets sold year-to-date. And while margins move around quarter-to-quarter, we expect full year margins for Ticketing to be in line with last year. In summary, we're confident that 2018 will be another year of record revenue in AOI results overall and for each of our businesses. On FX, Q3 revenue and AOI were negatively impacted by about 1% with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. And for the full year, we expect the impact to be less than 1%. Looking at Q4, we expect another strong Concerts onsale for next year, which we project to drive up to $10 million in advertising expense growth, along with increased deferrals in Ticketmaster's recognition of Live Nation concert tickets. And I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2018, our revenue was up 11% to $3.8 billion. AOI increased 16% to $386 million and free cash flow adjusted was $307 million, up 21% all compared to the third quarter of 2017. As of September 30, our deferred revenue related to future shows was $759 million. Revenue growth was driven by all our segments with the majority of the growth coming from Concerts, up 12%, from higher attendance and increased show count primarily in amphitheaters and arenas. Our AOI growth of 16% for the third quarter was also driven by the Concerts segment, which delivered 30% AOI growth. Operating income was $234 million, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year, and our net income for the quarter was $173 million, up 27% over last year both driven by the growth in AOI. For the third quarter, the impact to earnings per share from the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $21 million, consistent with the same period last year. For the nine months of 2018, revenue was up 11% to $8.2 billion. AOI increased by 17% to $761 million and free cash flow adjusted was $529 million, up 22% compared to the prior year. Revenue growth for the nine months was driven by solid growth across all our segments. Concerts grew by a 11%, again delivering the majority of the revenue growth due to increased amphitheater and arena activity, along with the higher onsite spend per fan in our amphitheaters. Sponsorship and Advertising also grew by 11% and Ticketing revenue was up 13%. AOI through September was up 17% as each segment delivered double-digit growth. Operating income was up 24% to $363 million. Driven by the increase in AOI, it was also impacted by slightly higher depreciation and amortization expense. Net income for the nine months was $208 million, up 13% due to our growth in operating income after higher interest expense from our debt refinancing. For the 9 months, the impact to earnings per share from the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was 54 million and we currently estimate that the impact for the full year will be approximately $77 million. Moving to our balance sheet, as of September 30, we had total cash of $1.9 billion, including $734 million in Ticketing client cash and $553 million in net Concert event-related cash, with free cash of $613 million. As you look at our working capital accounts on the balance sheet, the growth over December of 2017 is driven by the normal seasonality of the business at this time of year and a bit higher given the overall growth of the business since last year. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months was $256 million compared to $418 million in 2017. To maintain just the working capital where the receivables increased, driven by the higher Concert activity in the third quarter and accrued liabilities were down because of the payment of the legal settlement accrued last year. Free cash flow adjusted through September was $529 million, an increase of 22% over last year. Our total capital expenditures were $169 million for the nine months, of which 53% was spent on revenue generating items. We currently estimate that total capital expenditures for 2018 will be approximately $250 million, roughly half of which will be spent on revenue generating CapEx. As of September 30, our total net debt was $2.8 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.1%. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we currently expect that stock-based compensation expense and acquisition expenses will be in line with the third quarter of this year. Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our first question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions, I have a few. For Michael, you mentioned ticket pricing optimization in the prepared remarks. I guess the expansion of platinum ticketing and price increases were a big part of the strategy this year. Do you expect this as something that we're going to see a lot more of in 2019? Is there still a lot of room there? And what has been the feedback from artists and fans? Then I have some follow-up.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Brandon. Yeah, we believe that we kind of had this theme we've talked about for a while on tickets continually be probably the most inefficiently priced product in the world. I mean, there is literally no other product in the world that is worth more than it's sold a second later. Generally, what you do is you increase your price. But we know we had this balance of the artist, this incredible brand manager and he has to find that fine line of what does Bruce Springsteen charge for the front row versus what the market will bear. So we know that we don't expect the business to be completely efficient market-wise because it will probably be a contradiction to maybe what the artist stands for, but we do know that $8 billion number is that they throw around on the size of the secondary market with the price gap. We do know every year the artist is looking more and more at, I have to figure out through VIP Platinum P1 (18:57) how to charge more for the front because I can't continually let it just be sold on the secondary market. So we think we're in that first, second inning of that game. We think there's a long great path forward where the artists will continually look to increase the pricing. Now, the advantage is we get to decrease the pricing in the back part of the house. Generally, our problem, in any concert, we never have the back sold but not the front. As you know, the house usually is, the front is sold and we're trying to fill the rest of the house. So the lower we can price the backend and the higher we can price the frontend is the optimate pricing for both the gross and for sell-through. So this is just a new kind of concept of dynamic pricing and increasing the pricing in the front. We're in the first or second inning and we think we have lots of pricing opportunity for years to come.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. And then I was wondering if you could unpack your outlook for especially Ticketing a little bit. How will the timing of onsales this year versus last impact the phasing of AOI at Ticketmaster between Q4 and 2019 and maybe how accounting changes here and abroad may also impact AOI at Ticketing?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, Brandon. I'll take a leap for the first part. This is Joe. Our expectation is, is that next year is going to be another very good year. As I've said in some of my comments, we see a strong setup of onsales in Q4, the benefit of which is certainly on the Ticketing side with Ticketmaster recognizing a number of those tickets, particularly the non-Live Nation side of any tickets that get sold in Q4. Part of the impact is also on the Concerts side. Through the accounting, you expense your advertising for non-sale when – in the period it takes place. So our large onsales that we'll have as we do particularly a stadium, big arena tours will be recognized in Q4 in in the Concerts part of the business. And then I'll let Kathy speak to what the accounting means for some of the recognition.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. And it's less about changes next year versus this year in the accounting, it's more just the fact that we're expecting more of those tickets to be sold for Live Nation events by Ticketmaster, and because of that, for the tickets we control, we defer those to next year. So that's what Joe was addressing in his prepared remarks on that.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. And then just one more. Your acquisition strategy has generally been to use cash to fund your inorganic growth. And as rates come up and the environment changes a little bit, do you expect to only continue to do cash acquisitions, or would you consider starting to use your stock a little more as well?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, we absolutely consider both and we'll look depending on the size of the acquisition. Obviously, our cash, we're pretty happy with our debt structure right now but have room in our leverage ratio. We're in a pretty comfortable space, so we'll look at overall the AOI that'll be coming in and start to consider at least a combination of cash and stock on bigger deals.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question will come from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. With the on-site, you've had tremendous growth over the past few seasons. What further opportunity do you see at the North America amphitheaters? And then just beyond that, what's the opportunity to take those best practices from the amps to the festivals and then maybe to the clubs and theaters as well?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. This is Joe, David. As we said, we're at about $27 per fan right now. When we benchmark the sports fees, they're in the 30s, so we think there continues to be good opportunity for continued growth over the next several years by further honing the offer, the VIP offer, all of the other ancillary services that we have. So we're very optimistic. We think the organizational change we put in place at the end of last year to get more focus on execution to the amps has helped a lot this year and the continued growth there. So we think there's quite a bit more to continue to move. And absolutely we are taking learnings that we're getting here. We've brought them into the theatre and club business particularly in North America already, very focused on the VIP offerings there, focused on our beverage service, what we have, our points of sale, our mix and so on. And I think festivals are more individualized given the thematic of the festival, but absolutely starting to roll some of that out there, too.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just regarding your commentary for concerts in Q4, I think you mentioned North America would be strong but measured against international tough comp. And then is there any way you can sort of frame your outlook for concerts in the aggregate for Q4?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. Nothing more than we've already given.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So two questions. First, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about your acquisition pipeline. It looks like you acquired an asset in Brazil this quarter. Are there any other geographic markets that you're focused on either on the Events or Ticketing side? And my second question is there's been a lot of questions I think from investors on the upcoming FTC workshop in Ticketing, can you just talk through some of the details around this, whatever you're willing to share either the process or some of the issues that they're depressing on? Thank you.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Amy. We continue as we have historically. We think there are lots of great bolt-on acquisitions that are generally accretive as we're buying them. We're in over 40 countries now. So we look at building on where we already have a business. So in those 40 countries, we're always looking for ongoing festivals or established promoters or music venues that can build on our business and grow our core business. So we kind of look at it on a global basis and have a running acquisition list of things we're exploring. I'd say all of – there's no one country that's more important than the other, we see growth in all of it. U.S. as you've all seen, the last few years has been growing and we think the U.S. has lots of growth left. We have a lot of markets where we're underdeveloped still in cities, Miami and Florida, Los Angeles, Denver, Seattle, we have a lot of markets where we can still grow our business. Canada is a big opportunity, Australia, South America, as you've seen us move over the last few years. So what we love about this business is actually the global opportunity on a bolt-on strategy with really no regulations on a local basis. So it allows us to move into these countries like Argentina and Brazil and Milan and in Cape Town. And if there's a great international promoter or a festival, we can instantly buy that and build it into our global platform and power accretively instantly. So what we – we have a long list of businesses we look at across the globe and we think that will keep – you'll keep hearing about an ongoing story of the bolt-on to keep building our business. Joe will fill you in on the TM.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes. Yeah. So Amy, on the FTC workshop, just to be clear, the FTC in our conversations with them have told us this workshop has been long in the works, well predates any of that press cycles that existed around various assertions that as we've answered with the Senate and elsewhere were largely misleading about. But the FTC workshop, to our understanding, is going to focus on a wide variety of practices in ticketing, it's going to focus on speculative ticket sales, which is basically ticket sales where the ticker doesn't actually exist. It's going to focus on fraudulent advertising and the use of misleading websites. It's going to focus on the use of bots, all three of which, to be clear, Ticketmaster doesn't participate in. We're the only major secondary site that doesn't do spec selling, doesn't – we certainly don't use fraudulent advertising and our policy is not to allow bots – is first to try stop bots and secondly, to not let people who use bots post their tickets. So we think there's going to be a whole host of topics and we're going to fully participate. We applaud the fact that the workshop is taking place and we think that there'll be a lot more transparency and accurate information coming out of it.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on Presence. So Q4 10 million fans expected to enter $5 million on mobile. What's, I guess, the barrier there to getting that $5 million up to a higher number at some point?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Is the question barrier or...
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, it's not – this is Joe. It's not really – the reason why it's $5 million versus $10 million is the decision by teams whether or not paper tickets for season ticket holders are also issued in addition to the use of the mobile tickets. There are some teams that have already switched to mobile only with the exception of people that have indicated an issue, that's what we talked about up to 97% of the people entering a game on a mobile ticket. So it's our expectation that as teams get more comfortable with the technology, they see it working, they see other teams that are the leaders able to get 97% plus in without any issues, we'll have more and more teams adopting the use of all mobile.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. And then I guess following up on – I'm bringing this question on pricing. Are you seeing kind of pricing across the board with all artists, so everyone taking a little bit more pricing equally, or are there a couple of artists that are kind of pricing much closer to market value and then you've got a kind of a pool of artists you need to go back and address in the future?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, it's across the board. There would be – generally, every artist is probably underpricing this product, might just be the one front row or it might be the first 17 rows depending how big you're for an arena or a stadium. But generally, artists underprice their product and all have opportunity to increase their pricing.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then I guess back to the digital ticketing, as you – as your data kind of improves on who's coming to the shows and their behavior there, when you think about sponsorship and advertising, the 70 partners that drive 75% of the revenue, how has that changed? Do you think you have room for more partners that drive a big chunk like that, or is it those 70s and even more?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think it's both. I think those 70 absolutely have already shown their commitment to music and to our business reaching these millennial fans. And when they can get an even tighter connection they will absolutely be spending more because they'll be getting the results from their sponsorship. And there continue to be a number of categories and markets where we have sponsorship opportunities, and I think this just makes our product all the more attractive in general for all of those potential sponsors.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And I'm just going to jump on that. The core of the digital ticket unlocks multiple revenue avenues for us as well as just a better way to do business. Right now, as we've talked about, we have 16,000 barcodes that walked in the arena. I don't know who those barcodes generally are, if they've changed hands. In the future, we're going to have 16 (32:04) digital tickets walk in that building that are scanned. So, we're going know who those 16,000 people – we're going to have a one-on-one dialogue with them. So yes, our data increases tremendously on knowing all about the customers that go to our shows, so that's obviously very valuable for sponsors. But two, we also get to talk to the fans at the show. It really opens up the how do you correspond with these 16,000 people that walked in a concert. Do you upsell them when they're walking, do you know what seats they're in, are they getting a beer or are they buying a T-shirt? So you really bring to life those 90 million customers that go to a Live Nation show we talk about that generally we haven't been able to actually sell once they walk in the door. We're good at getting them to the door. We're good at talking to them weeks before the show. We haven't had any technology to-date that lets us talk to them while they're at the most important place: the show, the festival, the pre-show, the after show. So we get to talk to them while they're at the show, provides incredible revenue opportunities. Also, just you're at a country show, we can talk to you about – do you want to go next Friday, we have tickets available for another show. So the dialogue that we get to create with this engaged customer base when a digital ticket turns a barcode into a customer both before the show and at the show provides incredible opportunities for our Concert division and our Sponsorship division.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
David Joyce - Evercore ISI: Thank you. Could you please talk about the Ticketmaster margins? I know you've already guided to similar margins to last year and also in the past you've talked about obviously managing to cash flow growth instead of the margins themselves, but could you please discuss what the impacts are on the margins from the mix of international ticketing businesses which are typically lower, and from the investment level on continually redeveloping Ticketmaster? Just help us think about what the impacts are there and why the impact of higher volumes are not resulting in higher margins. Thank you.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, David, just again just to make sure we frame this, year-to-date, our revenue is up 13% and our AOI is up 11%. And I indicated that for the full year, our margins are expected to be flat. So that's the overall context of it. It's a very stable business, and yes, we continue to make substantial investments in areas like digital ticketing which is, as Michael just went through, for a lot of reasons massive change in the Ticketing business that'll have a dramatic benefit on Concerts side of the business, on our Sponsorship side of the business, so that flows through elsewhere. So part of it is divisional accounting may track costs in one area and benefits in another on some levels. But it is also, yes, our investments on ticketing throughout the world. International ticketing continues to grow well which, as we've talked about, is generally a lower margin. We're continuing to focus and invest in our theaters and clubs, do-it-yourself business where we have 25,000 shows, 25 million fans a year which we think is very important to continue to develop high-quality tools for the artists. And those tend to be lower margin tickets due to their general simplicity relative to what exists at the arena, amphitheater or stadium level. So we'll continue to grow the business across all fronts, and I think continue to deliver strong AOI growth against that.
David Joyce - Evercore ISI: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Please go ahead.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah, thanks. Just continuing on the margin theme, I mean, on the flip side, the really impressive margin improvement in the huge Concerts segment, and I know you've talked about the pricing in the house and the revenue per attendee going up, scheduling improvements, but what's sort of driving that overall and how much more progress can you make on margins in the Concerts segment?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey Doug, this is Joe. I think you gave the two big drivers which is we continue to grow the high margin food and beverage, ancillaries per fan, that flows through very well. And then secondly, pricing inherently flows through very well also. So those are the two biggest drivers. For all the reasons that we talked about before not being margin obsessed, I don't think we're focused on what exactly can that be because we'll continue to grow our business in stadiums and arenas and other buildings that may be more traditional margins as opposed to our buildings which will be higher margins. We'll have different mix year-to-year. We thought this year is a heavier amphitheater mix. We've also got arena growth so those fluctuations and the fact that we are overall just focused and obsessed on growing the business and growing profitably means that we're not going to be as determined as we think about that margin number.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Well, you had cited earlier in the year that the big stadium show mix would be not as great in this year's third quarter, I think you've cited in this release...
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: ...specifically internationally. Does that does help your margins when that's true?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well on a relative basis, your amphitheaters are going to because of your average per fan revenue you get from the onsite, it's going to be your highest margin customer, if you will. So in a year we've got relatively more amphitheaters than, yes, that's going to help your margin.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Right. Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: But Doug, we've always talked – we're growing our business – it's more important on our scale flywheel to grow than for me just to select amphitheater shows that are higher margin and at the expense of stadiums or other shows, right? So we know that if we get 90 million customers in our flywheel on a positive basis that we can sell them more food, we can sell them more sponsors, we can sell them more ticketing services, all the other higher margin businesses than the low margin flywheel. So our first goal is we will continue to grow the global market share of the Live business which we still have great opportunities in, with that then we'll also be able to grow across our businesses that we scale from that flywheel.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Got it. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further telephone questions at this time. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

And it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2018 conference call. We've continued our strong performance in the second quarter with AOI up 18%, revenue up 7%, and free cash flow up 14%. Each of our businesses contributed to these results, all delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. We have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, bringing over 550 million fans in 40 countries to live events each year. With our key metrics in Concerts, Sponsorship and Ticketing, all pacing ahead of last year, I'm confident that 2018 will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the company. Starting with our concert business, which is our flywheel, and through July we have sold 70 million tickets to shows this year, almost 3 million tickets more than last year at this point, putting us on track to have over 90 million fans in our concerts this year. In the second quarter, we promoted 9,000 shows for over 25 million fans, delivering a 13% increase in AOI and 6% revenue growth. As we previously indicated, this year will be particularly strong in our amphitheaters, with attendance up double-digits to the second quarter and on track to grow by 3 million fans for the full year. Given our ability to drive high-margin on-site spending with this audience, these additional fans are highly profitable. At the same time, we continue improving on-site experience at our amphitheaters, driving increased spend per fan, with additional points of sale, improved product mix and optimized pricing. From this and other initiatives, we expect spend per fan to accelerate this year increasing by $2.5 to $3. We also continue to capture greater value for the artists and Live Nation through pricing optimization, delivering more of the market value to the artists. As a result, average ticket pricing is up double-digits in amphitheaters and arenas so far this year, driving a $500 million increase in revenue for the year, assuming consistent price increases continue. Through the second quarter, we have booked 5,000 arena and amphitheater shows, up 18% over this point last year, putting us on track to sell over 90 million tickets of 32,000 shows and deliver double-digit AOI growth in our concert business. Our Sponsorship business continues to grow rapidly, with AOI up 14% and revenue 12% for the quarter. The strength of our platform and our ability to provide direct engagement with over 90 million fans has enabled us to continue building relationships with strategic brands that have driven much of our growth. This group accounts for 75% of our total sponsorship and the number of these sponsors has grown double digits this year, as we have added relationships with companies such as American Eagle, General Mills, Rémy Martin. As a result, the committed spend by these strategic sponsors is also up double-digits through mid-July. Festivals provide a key opportunity for sponsors to engage fans at a time when they are receptive to such brand messages. Our European festivals have grown particularly strong in the second quarter, with revenue per fan at these festivals up 12%. Overall, through July, we are pacing double-digits ahead of last year in committed revenue, with 90% of our planned revenue for the year committed. Given this, I expect we delivered double-digit AOI growth in Sponsorship again this year. Ticketmaster continues to demonstrate that it's the best marketplace for venues, team and artist to sell tickets to fans globally, with GTV growth on fee-bearing tickets up 11% this quarter. As a result, Ticketmaster's AOI for the quarter was up 15% and revenue up 13%. At its core, Ticketmaster continues to be the most effective ticketing platform in the world, with the technology to service venues, sports teams and artists and the marketplace to attract and convert ticket buyers. Our digital ticketing rollout is proceeding on plan with Phase 1 in 2018 focusing on deploying our Presence access control systems. To date, we have installed Presence systems in 125 venues, with another 75 venues planned in the second half of this year, positioning us to have at least 60 million fans using this system next year. In addition to building technologies to better service our venues, artists and teams, we continue investing to make Ticketmaster an even better marketplace for fans to buy tickets. In broadening ticketing options for fans, we have increased the number of events listed on Ticketmaster by 16% this year to almost 280,000 events through June. From a fan behavior standpoint, we continue to see an ongoing shift to mobile, and following a redesigned purchase experience, mobile ticketing sales were up 34% for the year, now accounting for 40% of all ticket sales, with mobile conversion rates up double-digits. Overall, Ticketmaster results are validating our strategy of delivering efficient marketplace for fans to buy tickets, while providing a great enterprise software solution to venues, teams and artists looking to maximize the value of their events. With this strategy's continued success, I expect us to deliver high-single digit growth in Ticketing AOI this year. In summary, 2018 is on track for the company to deliver double-digit AOI growth, along with strong gains in revenue and free cash flow. Each of our businesses is contributing to this success, as we put on more concerts for a greater number of fans, continue to monetize fans who come to the shows and sell more tickets to events of all types and further demonstrate the value of our 90 million fans to sponsors. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details of our performance this quarter.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Before I get into the division numbers, as a reminder, we're now comping against Q2, 2017, which was our highest AOI growth quarter ever, with $40 million or 22% overall AOI growth, including 51% Concerts AOI growth and 21% Sponsorship AOI growth. Against that backdrop, this quarter was our third largest AOI growth quarter ever, with AOI up another 18%. Getting into our business segments, first Concerts, Live Nation Concerts' AOI in the second quarter was up 13% and revenue was up 6%. Driving that growth, Concerts had its highest second quarter attendance ever, including arena attendance growth of 17%, with over 7.5 million fans, amphitheater attendance growth was up 14% and is trending to grow by 3 million fans this year, and global festival attendance was up 3% across 33 festivals in the second quarter, with record crowds at 14 of these festivals. Looking to the full year, again, this year we expect to promote about 20 of the top 25 global tours and we have already sold almost 70 million tickets for shows this year through July, an increase of 4%, consistent with our expectation of surpassing 90 million fans for the full year. Our pipeline of amphitheater and arena shows continues to be very strong with over 5,000 shows booked through July, up 18% compared to this point last year. Festival ticket sales are up double-digits through July and we expect our 100-plus festivals will host almost 9 million fans this year. Coming off the biggest stadium year in the history of the company in 2017, we expect our stadium show count and attendance will be a bit lower this year, but will still be our second-largest stadium year ever, with over 250 shows globally. As we now have good visibility into the full year, we expect double-digit growth in amphitheater on-site spending, increased ticket pricing and mid-single digit growth in fan attendance, and we are therefore confident that we will again deliver solid double-digit growth of Concerts' AOI for the full-year. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, our Sponsorship business benefited from our Concerts flywheel, helping drive AOI up 14% this quarter, while revenue was up 12%. In the second quarter, over 60% of the AOI growth was from Sponsorship, split fairly evenly between North America and International. Our North America online business drove the remaining AOI growth for the quarter, driven by new ad units in the financial services category. Based on the Sponsorship & Advertising net revenue now contracted for the year, we're confident we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full-year. Finally, Ticketmaster, for the second quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 15% and revenue up 13%. Total global GTV was up 7% for the quarter and global fee-bearing GTV was up 11%. This came from a 9% increase in primary GTV and 29% growth in secondary GTV. North America was the primary driver of our fee-bearing GTV growth, up 15% for the quarter. Concerts activity continues to be the primary driver of GTV growth, accounting for approximately 80% of primary GTV growth so far this year and secondary growth was also heavily driven by concerts, with sports, and notably, the NFL also providing material growth in the quarter. Based on our results for the first half and our second half pipeline, we expect Ticketmaster to deliver high-single digit AOI growth for the full year. In summary, now more than halfway through the year, we are confident that 2018 will be another year of record top line and AOI results overall and for each of our businesses. On a few specifics, we expect Q3 AOI overall to be up low-double digits, and on FX, we had a 1% to 2% positive impact on the business in Q2 and expect to largely give back in Q3 what we gained in Q2. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe and good afternoon everyone. Our key financial highlights for the second quarter of 2018, our revenue was up 7% to $2.9 billion. AOI increased 18% to $260 million. Free cash flow adjusted was $176 million, up 14% compared to the second quarter of 2017. And as of June 30, our deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.6 billion. The increase in revenue was across all our segments. Concerts was up $131 million or 6%, driven by arena and amphitheater activities. Sponsorship was up 12%, with growth in both North America and Europe, and Ticketing revenue was up 13% from increased fee-bearing ticket volumes. Our AOI growth of 18% for the second quarter was again driven by all three segments with each delivering double-digit growth. Our operating income for the quarter was $135 million, a 19% increase over last year, driven by the growth in AOI. And net income for the quarter was $69 million, as compared to $81 million last year, due to the impact of higher interest expense and non-controlling interest expense, along with increases in net foreign exchange rate losses. For the quarter, the impact of earnings per share from the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $17 million, fairly consistent with the first quarter of 2018. For the first six months of 2018, revenue was up 11% to $4.4 billion. AOI increased 19% to $374 million and free cash flow adjusted was $222 million, up 23%. All of our segments delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and AOI for the first six months. The majority of the revenue growth in the first half of the year was in the Concerts segment, up 10%, largely from increased show count and attendance in arenas and amphitheaters. Sponsorship & Advertising revenue increased 14%, with strong growth in North America, and Ticketing revenue was up 16% from higher fee-bearing ticket sales. AOI growth for the first six months was from strong increases across all three segments. Operating income was up 40% to $129 million from the increase in AOI. And net income for the first half of the year was $35 million compared to $48 million last year, due to the impact of higher interest expense and non-controlling interest expense, along with increases in net foreign exchange rate losses. For the first six months, the impact to earnings per share from the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest was $34 million, and we currently estimate that the impact for the full year will be approximately $75 million, with the remainder for the year fairly consistent across the last two quarters. Moving to our balance sheet, as of June 30, we had total cash of $2.3 billion, including $734 million in ticketing final cash and $1.1 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving free cash of $458 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months was $520 million compared to $805 million last year, due to the timing of event-related working capital amounts, primarily related to artist deposits impairments to ticketing clients. Our total capital expenditures were $94 million for the first six months, with over half spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect total capital expenditures for 2018 to be approximately $250 million, with roughly half on revenue-generating CapEx. As of June 30, our total net debt was $2.8 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.1%. For the remainder of 2018, we currently expect that non-cash compensation expense in the second half of the year will be fairly consistent to the first six months, and acquisition expenses and interest expense for each of the last two quarters of 2018 will be similar to the second quarter of 2018. Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.
Operator: We'll go first to Brandon Ross at BTIG.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Couple of questions actually. If you look back at your geographic mix over the last several years, International has maintained a pretty constant share of, I guess, your revenue and AOI. What in your mind has held International back from becoming a bigger part of your business? Is balance sheet or access to capital your biggest constraint to unlocking your global opportunity? And then I have some follow-ups.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And thanks, Brandon. No, I don't think the context is that we've been holding back the International growth. The great news is the U.S. business has continued to grow at exceptional rates. So we look at both a global footprint of huge International opportunity long term, but we also see in the U.S. a market that still has great runways and a lot of markets that we're still not in, cities within the U.S., sponsorship and pricing, monetization and amphitheaters alone as we keep talking about, that's going to be a big growth driver for us for the next few years as we increase per heads. So the U.S., we've just continually executed across our platform, been able to grow it and drive both revenue and AOI, while we've been equally growing the International business both at TM, Sponsorship and Concerts. So we think over long term, like most businesses that are global, we think that the International opportunity will continue to be a long-term great opportunity from a revenue and AOI. You've seen us move into markets like South America and Asia, South Africa and Eastern Europe, and those markets were relatively zero market share, will continue to be great long-term opportunities. So we think the business both is a U.S., Canadian opportunity for the next 5 years at minimum to keep monetizing our current business while we grow it and we'll keep growing internationally across our businesses. We don't see any real capital constraints. There has never been an acquisition or a bolt-on or something that we want to do that our balance sheet hasn't afforded us. As you know that, I think the beautiful story of Live Nation is we're not looking for large acquisitions outside of the core, it's still a very fragmented, mom-and-pop business on a global basis. So we've been able to take advantage of our bolt-on strategy, whether it's in Philadelphia or Milan, whether it's a festival or concert promoter or a venue. We can buy those with our current balance sheet. We're really good at synergizing those on a global basis and making them accretive very fast. So, we don't see any constraints to our balance sheet. We have a lot of capacity left on our balance sheet. But at the end of the day, most things we're looking to buy are going to be accretive, because they're down the center field of our core business. And when we buy a festival in Milan, a promoter in South Africa, we're bringing instant revenue and AOI to that business from our ticket sponsorship and content pipe. So continue to see growth both global, U.S. and our current balance sheet can continue to power that growth.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. And driving primary ticket price has been a big initiative for you guys and I guess industry wide this year. As you look back on the first half, do you believe taking price on tickets has been a successful endeavor for the industry? And do you plan to continue to push price as we think about 2019?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I think we've talked out loud that there's still – it's not a precise number because it's not tracked, but $8 billion is used, but there is a huge secondary business that still exists, which still means that pricing inefficiency is alive and well for both sports teams and great artists, where the product primary price sold is leaving a lot of money on the table. So, we've said it over the last couple of years, I'll probably saying it for the next five years, as the market becomes more efficient, meaning the artists, the sports team, the content owner has a larger appetite to price higher, to take some of those tickets out of the business, the opportunity will be an ongoing annual opportunity for us at Live Nation, as we try to convince content that one of the great ways to maximize and minimize scalping is to maximize your pricing strategy. Now, there's also ways that you got to lower the prices in the backend of the house to make sure you sell through and there's no one simple strategy, but overall pricing and increasing the P1s or the VIP tickets or the platinum tickets, we do know is a great way to take some of the secondary business and turn it into the pockets of the artist and the sports team.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And Brandon – yeah, Brandon, just giving you a few specific numbers, again, as Michael mentioned, amph and arena pricing is up double-digit so far this year. And at this pace, we'll deliver another $500 million this year to artists, and we think that's maybe 10% of the secondary opportunity. So, long runway to continue doing it, as we continue to get better and better pricing models and artists get more comfortable that they're the ones who should be getting that money as opposed to brokers.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. And just a quick housekeeping, can you speak to the mix of amphitheater shows in Q2 versus Q3?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: It would be roughly 30% as Kathy is double checking, but I'd say it's about 30% Q2, 70% Q3.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. Thanks for the questions.
Operator: And we'll go next to John Janedis at Jefferies.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Thank you. Maybe somewhat of a follow-up to Brandon's question, but on the Sponsorship & Advertising business, you guys talked about European festivals, but with some of the acquisitions you've done and the global expansion, what opportunities are ahead for maybe LatAm or Asia to be more of a growth driver? Are the U.S. clients making more global buys now as a result, or will it be a combination, or regional and global and or local?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, our business is all three. We're selling – out of our 900 sponsors, we have a lot of sponsors that are buying the local Milan or Tampa Bay advertising package at an arena or amphitheater series. We have a regional business. And then you have the strategic global clients. So it works on all levels. The more – when we buy a festival and promoter and move into a market in Germany, it provides our Sponsorship team instant inventory for the local and regional sponsorship buy, which you need as a foundation. And when my team is talking to the CMO, CEO, at a global organization being – obviously laying out our platform and all of our touch points, and the more markets that we can touch, the more of an opportunity will present to that global brand. So, we are always been a combination of a local business with a central strategy and a central buying strategy. But you need local execution to drive both the sponsorship and then ultimately the concert.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Got it. And maybe separately, over time on Presence, do you get to 90 million plus or 100 million fans over time with that or is it cost prohibitive as you move towards smaller venues?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, there is no cost limitation on it. It's just the ramp up. We expect fairly quickly for it to become the standard access control system.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to David Karnovsky at JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thank you. We've recently seen your theater and club division at the new venues in Cleveland, and before that, Denver, can you just provide more color on the opportunity you see in this space? And then separately, do you see potential to expand your North America amphitheater footprint at all, just given the success you're having with on-site?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you. We look at our business and there's multiple channels we want to continue to grow in. Festivals, we've talked about, and within festivals, the 100-plus we have now in that channel, there's sub-strategies within that. So we look at theaters and clubs the same. On a global basis, we're probably close to 200 that we may manage, lease or book, in some sense, U.K., Australia, Canada and the U.S. That division has been growing because you read about the explosion of the experience, and probably in your local town, what used to be a dance bar or a club now is a live bar and live music is alive and well, and 500 seat venues, and 2,000 and 4,000 seats. So, we've seen a new surge, whether it's in retail developments, malls being converted, where everyone is looking for a live club as a – one of their anchor tenants. So, we're talking to lots of developers all the time about adding a House of Blues or a film or one of our many 500 to 5,000 seat venues that are high margin, provide incredible platform for us, for our sponsorship, and our young artist network. So we're going to continue to looking in markets on a global basis, and if there's an opportunity with the right retail developer or a developer or a location that we think works, then we'll continue to expand there.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then, on the opportunity to expand your North America amphitheater footprint at all?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Same thing. We think the amphs are – again, lots of cities don't have amphitheater or lots of times the amphitheater is 40 miles outside of town and there's a new urban opportunity like in Boston and Toronto. So, whether we're looking in the U.S., Canada at upgrading or elevating our current position or we're looking at some international markets where we think – an outdoor amphitheater is a great experience. In our research, if you ask fans where do they want to see their band of choice, it's kind of obvious they want to see U2 in a small club than they'd love to see them outdoors where they can dance and have fun, and then the list goes on from there. So, we know amphitheaters and outdoor experience, social gathering, all those good things is a real important value proposition, and we'll continue to look for places to expand that makes sense for us.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just on Ticketing, I think you did 16% AOI growth in the first half and you've got into high-single digit growth for the year. Can you just walk through some of the puts and takes for how to think about growth in the back-half? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, this is Joe. We tend to see Q1 and Q4 as our largest quarters. Q4 is when the on-sales for the next summer starts, particularly driven by stadiums, and then in the Q1 for the arenas, and later in Q1 for the amphitheaters, and generally the size is a bit smaller in Q2 and then the smallest in Q3. So Q2 has got the trailing end of the amphitheaters and arenas and they're closed for the summer. And then Q3, you tend to have a lot less going on sale. So, less activity from the concert side.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll move next to Drew Borst at Goldman Sachs.
Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Couple of questions if I may. Firstly, on the digital ticketing in the Presence system, then you guys talked about how you're going to ramp that up over the back-half of the year. Can you talk about the financial implications of rolling that out?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. These are not overly expensive systems frankly, our access controls. Our Presence systems are more standardized in terms of off-the-shelf components. So tend to actually be less expensive to deploy than it was for us to deploy our traditional systems. So, we don't think it's a meaningful cost, it's all within the CapEx estimates that Kathy is giving you, which is, I think sort of within our normal overall spending range.
Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I was also wondering if, as you look out into next year, is there other benefits to revenue growth and some profit as you deploy it?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Absolutely, there are benefits, as we get the data from the digital ticketing in terms of who the individuals are, their behavior, that has a substantial unlocking the marketing on both the Ticketmaster and the Concert side, and also provides substantially more value for our sponsors in terms of their ability to understand who exactly they're engaging with. I don't think we're ready yet to declare the timing on those benefits. But there's no question that those benefits will be an important driver of our business in years to come.
Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. And then on the on-site spending, I appreciate the update and the increase in the guidance for on-site spending this year. As you look at over the next couple of years, 2019, 2020, how do you think about the roadmap to continue driving that growth?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think what we've said is, we're very focused on getting that number to at least $30 to put us on parity with the major sports teams, and once we get to $30, we'll reassess and give you guys the guidance and direction from there.
Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just last one from me, recently Ticketmaster had a data breach in London. Could you just give us some color on if there's any risk of a penalty, because I think this would fall under GDPR, which was recently implemented. But could you just give a little bit of color on that?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Just to correct one specific comment, it was a vendor of ours was breached. Ticketmaster systems were not breached. It resulted in the loss of some of our customer data, low single-digit percentage of our customers on a global basis. We're obviously working with the ICO, which is the EU GDPR body as they need to look at this. We do not expect any impact that will be material, given the number of people impacted, given our insurance profile, we don't see it as being a material risk.
Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ryan Sundby at William Blair.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on Drew's question on Presence there. As you kind of roll out these – the 200 systems, do they all turn on kind of immediately or is there some kind of ramp period there?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So the systems are all on immediately as you deploy them, and the systems are effectively, they're backward compatible. So, in general, to the extent there are any trailing PDFs out there, the systems can still take those and then on a go-forward basis, as it switches to all digital or a combination of digital and some sort of RFID or other stocks, then it can take those as well. So as we deploy them into our amphitheaters this summer, that was exactly how it worked, because there have been on-sales that had PDFs, those systems had to be able to be backwards compatible, taking those tickets as well.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. That helps. And then, I guess, I was a little surprised to hear that this will still be the second largest stadium concert year for you guys. So maybe, mix, is it still as big of a headwind as you thought it would be this year or has that maybe improved as you kind of got into the season more?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think we've always said we expected to have fan growth this year. It's just that we didn't expect as many stadiums as we had last year. So, just was trying to make that clear that it is our second biggest year, because we didn't want too much read into it.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Doug Arthur at Huber Research.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah, thanks. A couple of questions. Just going back to mix, I mean, the number of events is up again really significantly, 17.5%, I think year-over-year for International and North America. The attendance was up nominally, 2%. So, obviously, you've talked a lot about the stadium mix. Is this just continuation of very strong club activity in the mix at this point? I know that was a factor in Q1.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes, absolutely. Theaters and club business has continued to be very strong for all the reasons that David alluded earlier in his question. So to us, it's all positive.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: And you guys have made a – obviously done a lot of partnerships and some acquisitions, is there any way of kind of breaking out that impact on growth in Q2 in terms of new editions?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. It would be small, small, small. In the scheme of our 32,000 shows, you've seen everything that we've acquired. There's nothing that really is a dramatic, move the needle in terms of that fan base.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then, finally, Kathy, on the amortization of non-recoups. It's down this quarter versus last quarter, of course, so are revenues at Ticketing. Should we expect sort of a similar kind of number in Q3 and then a fairly – a larger number in Q4, because of the seasonality?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I mean, there's going to be a little bit of seasonality, and you can look at prior year, but we're still expecting full year to be consistent with last year.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to David Joyce at Evercore ISI.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some color on the supply of content, how you will keep growing that next year. Certainly is – are there just – are there a lot more artists who are on the roads? I was just wondering if you could kind of frame it for us, where the supply is, because clearly there's still plenty of demand and plenty of pricing to come. If you could just help us think about that for next year?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. We've said the last few years, we think there's more bands on the road, there's more events happening and more geographies that are being played now. So we think next year, the year after, on a global basis, there'll be more artists on the road playing some venue from small to big, and more fans going to those shows from a supply, demand. So overall, we think the industry is having a great, continued growth phase and we think it will last for quite a while, especially as the international and global markets start to build more venues and infrastructure to emulate a lot of the U.S. infrastructure.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: And in terms of the ancillary revenue opportunities that you've created at the festivals and amphitheaters, when would you be fully build out on those opportunities where you own or operate the venues?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think we see there still being quite a substantial runway in terms of the opportunity. We've given you guys most of the information on amphitheaters, so they've been making nice progress. But as we really think in terms of the best-in-class hospitality, we think there's still substantial runway there. Festivals, again, there's some great ones like the BottleRocks out there, that are just phenomenal at how they're driving F&B and their overall average per fan spending. And as we bring more of that DNA into our other 100 festivals, still see a lot of ways to go in terms of driving those numbers.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jason Bazinet at Citi.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just had a market share question. I think this is right, in Concerts, there's I think now four distinct revenue items, there's the money you get paid for promoting something, there's the food and beverage and ancillary, there is venues, and then there is Artist Nation. If you just focus on the promotion side of concerts and festivals globally, where do you think you are now in terms of market share?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So, on a global basis, we might be somewhere in the 20s to 30s. There's not a lot of great data on a lot of the international markets. But if you looked at small club dates to street festival, the market can be defined fairly broadly, but we've said out loud that we think somewhere in the 20% to 30% global market share, huge opportunity obviously on a global market still.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And then the other thing is just, we think that there's a lot of latent demand on top of the actual market today, especially for the top global talent that there hasn't had necessarily been the infrastructure to promote them through all of the markets. And as we do that, we think that will just build the market. So, that's the other reason that just makes it hard to give real, firm market share numbers today.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): If you don't win a mandate for some reason on the promotion side, someone turns you down, what's the most common reason?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: History another promoter, but...
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Lots of competition out there...
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: ...locally, different basis.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will bring our question-and-answer session to an end and additionally bring to an end today's conference. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Don, and I will be your conference facilitator today.

Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. 2018 is off to a great start, even better than I expected when we had our February call. The first quarter outperformed our projections as we delivered 19% revenue, 24% AOI, and 76% free cash flow growth, all of our divisions delivering double-digit AOI growth. Even more importantly, we now have booked enough concerts, sold enough tickets, had enough advertising commitments to be confident that we will have a successful 2018, delivering double-digit AOI growth for the year. We continue to benefit from a global concerts industry that is structurally growing with strong tailwinds for both supply and demand. Starting with the Concerts business, revenue was up 20%, and AOI improved by 29% as we promoted 22% more shows for 15% more fans globally in the first quarter. Looking toward the full year, through April, we have booked 5,000 arena, stadium and amphitheater shows, up 21% over this point last year. This growth is led by our amphitheaters, with show count up 27% to over 2,000 shows, growth that we will now further monetize through on-site fan spending. At this point, I have even stronger expectations for growth on-site spending at our amphitheaters. Across a number of initiatives we are executing this year, enhancing our VIP offering, adding points of sale and improving product selection, I now expect our average spend per fan to grow by at least $2.50 through the summer. We also continue to capture more value for the artists and Live Nation through pricing optimization, delivering more of the market value to the artists. As a result, average ticket pricing is up double digits across each amphitheater, arena and stadium tickets sold so far this year. And while North America is having a strong summer, we continue to see strong performance across the 40 countries we promote shows around the world, with tickets sold for international arena shows and festivals up double digits through April. I'm particularly encouraged by our progress in Latin America with tickets sold for shows in the region more than tripling so far this year. And our recently announced acquisition of Rock in Rio will provide us a strong foundation for future growth in Latin America. With our global concerts business looking strong again this year, the Concerts segment continues to be the engine that powers the Live Nation flywheel strategy, growing the profitability of the Concerts business while also driving our sponsorship and ticketing businesses. Our Sponsorship business continues to demonstrate the value of directly connecting with 90 million fans at our concert this year with revenue and AOI both up 17% for the quarter. Through April, we are pacing double digits ahead of last year in committed revenue, and have over 80% of our planned revenue for the year committed. I again expect our growth to be driven by our festivals and large strategic sponsors, and we continue adding a number of these new partners, including Frito Lay, Proctor & Gamble and Twitter. As a result, I expect we'll deliver double-digit AOI growth in Sponsorship again this year. Ticketmaster had a very strong start to the year as well, growing revenue 19% and AOI by 17% for the quarter, as it had its largest quarter in history, transacting almost 60 million tickets for 21% growth in global GTV to $5 billion. At its core, Ticketmaster continues to be the most effective ticketing platform in the world, with the technology to serve venues, sports teams and artists, and with the marketplace to attract and convert ticket buyers. Demonstrating our success, we signed 135 additional clients in the quarter, adding new clients across 19 countries. Our strategic partnership with the NFL is off to a strong start, with substantial increases in both primary and secondary ticket sales in the few weeks since the schedules were released. And as our pioneer client for digital ticketing, the NFL has eliminated ticket PDFs for next season, positioning teams to identify a much higher portion of fans attending their games. Verified Fan, our artist program to help ensure tickets are sold to fans at the onsale, also continues to grow with major onsales including Pearl Jam, Elton John, Thirty Seconds to Mars and 5 Seconds of Summer rolling out campaigns in the first quarter. And we continue investing in new technology to further differentiate Ticketmaster from others in the ticketing business. Today we announced our partnership with, and investment in, Blink Identity which has cutting-edge facial recognition technology, enabling you to associate your digital ticket with your image, and walk into the show. In addition to building technologies to better serve our venues, sports teams and artists, we continue investing to make Ticketmaster an even better marketplace for fans to buy tickets. To start, we have increased the number of events listed on Ticketmaster, up 16% for the quarter to over 195,000 events. And along with this, we increased site visits by 9% while lowering our paid cost of acquisition by 20% through continuing marketing improvements. Once we have customers visit our site, we further improve our conversion, particularly on mobile. Following a redesigned purchase experience on mobile that we rolled out last year, mobile ticket sales are up 36% for the quarter, now accounting for almost 40% of all ticket sales, with conversion rates improving by over 20%. With this strong start to the year, we expect another record year in ticketing. 2018 is on track to deliver double-digit AOI growth along with strong gains in revenue and free cash flow. Our key leading indicators for our Concerts, Sponsorship and Ticketing are ahead of last year, and we expect each of our businesses to deliver record revenue and AOI this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details on our performance this quarter.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, Concerts. In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 7,000 concerts for 12.5 million fans worldwide, increases of 22% and 15%, respectively. Show count growth exceeded fan growth because much of our show count increase came from club shows in the quarter which have a lower number of fans per concert. Both North America and international markets had strong fan growth at 18% and 11%, respectively. And for the full year through April 30, we've sold over 50 million tickets for shows this year, up 5% from last year and putting us on pace for about 90 million fans this year. This growth is largely being driven by North America so far with 34% growth in amphitheater ticket sales and 4% growth in arena ticket sales. Internationally, we have seen similarly strong growth in arena ticket sales, up 15%, with the expected decline in stadium shows. Globally, our festival business continues to expand as well with ticket sales for festivals up 17% year-on-year, heading forward where we expect to be almost 9 million fans this year. Overall, we continue to believe that 2018 will be another strong year for our Concerts business, growing our fan base by mid-single digits, further optimizing pricing, and capturing higher average spend per fan at our amphitheaters. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, AOI was up 17% for the quarter with North America up 13% and international up 21%. The majority of our growth came from the online portion of our business, up 25% for the quarter, driven by an increase of new advertisers across our digital network globally combined with growth in programmatic ad sales and continued strong interest in our new digital and content products. Given that over 85% of our advertising AOI is typically recognized from the second through fourth quarters, at this time of the year, our committed sales pipeline is our key leading indicator. And with over 80% of our target sponsorship committed, we're tracking to deliver double-digit AOI growth again this year. Finally, Ticketmaster's global GTV in the first quarter was $8.2 billion, up 12% year-on-year. Of this, our fee-bearing GTV was $4.5 billion, up 22% with ticket volume up 7%. Within this, primary GTV was up 22% while secondary GTV was up 28%. North America and international markets were similarly strong, up 23% and 21%, respectively. Concerts activity continues to be the primary driver for GTV growth for Ticketmaster with over 80% of primary GTV growth coming from concerts along with a substantial portion of our secondary growth. Overall, we were very pleased with our first quarter in Ticketing and how it sets us up for the full year. We saw continued strong consumer demand from most tours, also benefiting from some onsales that we were expecting in the second quarter moving into the first quarter. And as a result, we continue to expect mid-single digit growth in ticket sales for the year, generating double-digit growth in fee-bearing GTV. In summary, four months into the year, given the strength of all of our leading indicators, we're confident that we will deliver double-digit AOI growth in 2018. Our flywheel model is working. Our first quarter results were substantially driven by our Ticketing business, notably from selling more concert tickets. We will see these concerts play out throughout the year, driving our high-margin, on-site and sponsorship businesses. On a few specifics, we currently expect year-on-year percentage AOI growth to be fairly consistent across the remaining three quarters. And on FX, we had a 2% to 3% positive impact on the business in Q1, and based on rates today expect Q2 to be about the same. Before handing the call over to Kathy, let me step back and make a few comments about a recent New York Times article and some allegations it made. First, as it relates to the consent decree, we do not believe that over the past eight years, with almost 200,000 shows and thousands of Ticketmaster renewals, that we've made a practice of violating the consent decree. Unfortunately, our competitor, AEG, has chosen to complain to the DoJ whenever they lose to us, which has been often. And when they didn't get what they wanted out of the DoJ, they complained to The New York Times. That's the genesis of this. After AEG complained to the DoJ, we took a hard look at over 30 venues and produced information about our dealings with those venues. The DoJ then raised concerns about 3 of them, 3 out of over 2,000 venue clients in North America. We don't believe there were decree violations with respect to those three, but given the thousands of Ticketmaster venue relationships, this clearly shows we have no systemic issues. Second, it's important to emphasize that under the decree, we are allowed to bundle ticketing and content, and we are allowed to talk subjectively about how ticketing may affect concert routing. We are not allowed to force Ticketmaster on venues, nor are we allowed to retaliate against venues that choose other ticketing providers. And by policy and practice, we don't do either. We take our obligations to comply with the consent decree very seriously, and we broadly agree with the DoJ on what we can and cannot do. And since the beginning of the consent decree, we have had in place ongoing training and controls to ensure that we have the highest possible adherence to the decree. So we just don't believe we've intentionally violated the consent decree. Any possible disagreement with the DoJ is very much on the margin, generally having to deal with comments made by few local promoters over the years and how those comments can be misconstrued. This is not a case where the DoJ is fundamentally questioning our flywheel business model, nor thinks there is anything structurally unlawful about it. So, as a result, we don't see these issues leading to any fundamental changes in our business practices nor any material costs to the company. And I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. As I mentioned on the last call, beginning with this reporting period, we are now reporting royalties and nonrecoupable advances paid to our ticketing clients as a reduction to revenue in our Ticketing segment. This change has no impact to our AOI or operating income. We have adjusted the 2017 financial statements in this 10-Q to reflect this new reporting for comparability. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2018, our revenue was up 19% to $1.5 billion. AOI increased 24% to $114 million. Free cash flow adjusted was $46 million, up $20 million from the first quarter of 2017. And as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.8 billion, up 12% over the March of last year. The increase in revenue was driven by all segments with each delivering double-digit growth. The majority of this growth came from Concerts, up 20% with increased activity in arenas globally and North American theaters and clubs. Ticketing revenue was up 19% from higher primary and resale volumes, both driven by concerts as Joe noted. Our AOI growth of 24% for the first quarter was again driven by all three segments delivering double-digit growth. Strong growth in sales volume at Ticketmaster contributed most of the increase. Our operating loss was $6 million in the first quarter, an improvement of $15 million or 72% over last year, driven by the strong operating performance across all our business segments. And net loss for the quarter was $34 million, in line with last year with the increase in interest expense and debt extinguishment losses totaling $7 million primarily related to our March debt refinancing. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $16 million. For the full year, we currently estimate that this accretion will be approximately $70 million with the remainder for the year fairly consistent across the quarters. Turning to our balance sheet. In March, we issued $300 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2026, $550 million of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2023, and amended our senior secured credit facility to reduce the interest rate for our term loan B. The proceeds were used to repay the majority of the outstanding convertible senior notes due 2019 and the related repurchase premium and fees, leaving $524 million available to repurchase the remaining balance of the convertible notes due 2019 and for investment in the business. As a result, we recorded $3 million of debt extinguishment loss in the first quarter and we expect total interest expense for the full year to be approximately $140 million with growth evenly across the remaining quarters of 2018. As of March 31, we had total cash of $2.9 billion including $888 million in client cash and $1.3 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $718 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $775 million, up $14 million over the first quarter of 2017 primarily from our higher deferred revenue. Free cash flow adjusted was $46 million, up $20 million from the first quarter of last year. Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $37 million with 52% spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect our capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $250 million with approximately half on revenue-generating CapEx. Our total net debt as of March 31 was $2.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.1%. For the full year 2018, based on our current estimates, corporate AOI will be in line with last year with Q2 cost increasing over prior year by approximately 10%. And non-cash compensation will also be about the same as last year and fairly consistent across the quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, we currently expect that acquisition expenses will be about $10 million, which includes the estimated costs for Rock in Rio along with other transactions. And the impact of all net expenses below operating income will be approximately 25% of AOI for Q2. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks and good afternoon. So first, on Verified Fan, maybe there's a little bit of controversy out there with the Taylor Swift concert. What are you learning and how many fans do you have right now? Anything you could share with us would be really great. And I know – my second question is actually on concert mix. I know that margins are not a really big focus for you. But obviously given the mix of amphitheaters and the onsite revenue bogey that you laid out, should we be expecting that margins this year will improve relative to last year? Thank you.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Amy. It's Michael. I'll take Verified Fan. We had a very successful launch last year in terms of distribution and getting it across a ton of tours and kind of pursuing our goal of, can we identify fans in advance and then make sure that we can deliver that ticket to that fan at the price the artist wanted. 2017, we learned a lot. I would say that what we learned is the reality of Verified Fan is as long as we do it in advance and we get registered fans and then we have inventory to match, it works seamlessly. Where we learned some lessons is when we over-verified and didn't have enough inventory, i.e., you got verified but we still didn't have enough tickets – not a good experience for the fan – or when we did verify fan at onsale, and put too much pressure at one's time. So, overall, we've learned through the execution that when we register the fan in advance of the onsale, get that database done, correlate that, flush out any of the bad bots, we can identify fans directly and sell them. We wouldn't see any correlation on the controversy of Taylor Swift Verified Fan reducing sales. That wouldn't be the reason sales are strong or soft for an artist. Verified Fan is kind of a separate strategy, just a separate profiling to get fans the direct price. We've got a bunch of artists again using it this year. We think it's part of an ongoing evolution of artists taking control of delivering that ticket at their price.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And then this is Joe, Amy. On the concert mix, because all of the on-site revenues, $2.5 growth that Michael spoke about, all gets reported within the Concerts segment and that is – flows through at a very high margin. Absolutely, you're correct. When you have a shift in activity towards the amphitheaters, you would naturally see some margin expansion on the Concert business. As I think, we've talked in the past, I think, for the Concert business this year, we absolutely expect AOI to grow at an even more rapid rate than revenue because of that shift.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brandon Ross with BTIG.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Thanks for taking the question. So I know this summer for some of the high profile tours like Taylor and Beyoncé, you've raised price with the design of kind of smoking out brokers. But it looks like ticket sales for some of those shows are pretty relatively weak. How much of a sales lift do you expect there to be closer to the – closer to when those shows actually happen and how do you think about the tradeoff between attendance and price? And finally, can you kind of talk through the pluses and minuses of the strategy to take the brokers out of the equation. Thanks.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: All right. Brandon, I'll unpack that. We're not the promoter on Taylor Swift in America. So I don't know what those counts are. So, I can't comment on what pricing strategy they had there. We are doing Beyoncé, Jay-Z stadium tour. And that, I'm not sure what you're referencing there because the tour overall is very successful, would be close to over 90% sold. And by the time the show has all happened, we'll be close to sellout. So, no issues on selling. No tradeoff was put forward there. Priced aggressively, but also selling aggressively. But you are right. In theory, overall, what we like to talk to artists about is find that fine line. If you sell out at 10:01, you, in theory, probably have underpriced your show. So, when you sell out at 10:01 and there's eight pages of secondary sites selling your ticket at a higher price, you probably had pricing opportunity. So, artists are always the great brand manager trying to find that sweet spot between monetizing the show, as well as staying true to what the brand position is on pricing. So, I think, our thesis, overall, we talk about is every year, we see that the artist is pricing the house smarter, higher in the front end, maybe lower in the back end, and trying to take advantage of some of that secondary market that lives outside of their pot. So, overall, year-after-year, I think for the next five, six, seven years, you'll see artists every year climb back more from secondary into their own pricing and monetizing it themselves, which is great for our business.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. And then just to follow-up on The New York Times, is – that investigation is now fully over with, it sounds like? Just to confirm.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, there are the three venues that we noted that they've asked us questions about. So, we've given them information and we're not doing anything. But for the entire consent decree period, they've got the right to be coming back and asking us questions.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: We'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So this is a little bit of a strange question. But I guess I never really looked at the Ticketmaster growth prior to the Live Nation Ticketmaster combination until this New York Times article came out. And one of the things that surprised me is Ticketmaster's growth didn't really accelerate post the transaction. So I know it's a strange question because you guys had a good quarter and the results have been very strong at Ticketmaster along the way. But what evidence do you guys look at to know that the flywheel is actually working because when I look at that pre-deal, post-deal growth at Ticketmaster, it's not obvious I guess from the outside?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, one of the things, Jason, that we look at is, is the portion of the Ticketmaster growth that's being driven by the Concert business. And as we said for this quarter, that it was 80% of the GTV growth was driven by the Concert business. I think, part of this is you need to separate out the fee-bearing versus the non-fee-bearing. The fee-bearing being – sorry, the non-fee-bearing being a historically static season ticket volume that can historic growth rates. But if you look just at the fee-bearing GTV, I would have to believe we've got a substantially accelerated growth which is driven in good part by the fact that we've grown our Concert business. I don't remember the exact numbers in 2010 but call it 30-odd million fans to what should be now 90 million fans this year and with a very high portion of those fee going through Ticketmaster and being another way that we're continuing to monetize the overall events. So, I'm not sure what the facts are that you have, but that's how we look at it.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. Your release had noted that the show count for amps is up 27% this year, and I think, your 10-K has stated North America amp attendance last year was around 16 million. I know there're other factors to consider such as the mix of amp shows. But can we assume a similar growth rate for North America amp attendance this year?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think, it's a little bit early in the year. We still have all of our – almost all of our shows to play off. I think we gave you the guidance overall where we think the net balance between mix shift and volume increase in the amps will play out to around 90 million fans overall.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just on the Rock in Rio acquisition, can you just talk about how this changes your outlook for expansion in South America and then what you see is the opportunity to expand the brand to other territories?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. It gives us a great beacon in South America. We're now in 40 countries. We've been, over the last 15 years, good at entering markets. We tend to find an access point, either a promoter, existing promoting business, or a historic festival, which is attached to usually a great operator. Rock in Rio, one of the greatest festivals in the world, so good credible jump to our Brazilian business, and that will now be a real beacon for building around our Brazil and into the other South American markets, obviously sends a very loud signal to all of the potential partners we've been looking to bolt on to down there that we are serious about South America. Over the last couple of years, we've been put in lots of Metallica and Coldplay, U2 stadium tours throughout the region. So, we've got great partners, great experience. Now, we're going to turn that with Rock in Rio, turn it into a actual Live Nation businesses down there. This will be the start.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah, thanks. Couple of, sort of, boring financial questions and then a bigger picture question. Kathy, on the accounting treatment of the nonrecoups, on page 24 of the 10-Q, it looks like there is a – to net out the impact on AOI, there's a kind of other and elimination of a negative $1.2 million, so is that a one-time thing or is that to – is that something one should assume going forward? I mean, it's a small number but it lowers the AI impact add-back of nonrecoups.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: That will continue going forward. That's just eliminating some of the nonrecoup activity between Live Nation and Ticketmaster. So that's why we're adding back the net number.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then in terms of your restatement for last year, I mean, the segment elimination revenue figure and loss figure is down dramatically from a year ago. So, I assume that's the nonrecoup change.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Correct. So, yes, we've adjusted last year's to match the new accounting. So, what you're seeing in the Q, gives you consistent accounting between 2017 and 2018. But so, everything therein, the total and Ticketing had to be adjusted.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then finally, sort of bigger picture, how much did acquisition sort of ballpark impact particularly Ticketing in the quarter at large because you have been pretty active on that front?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, we've been pretty active. But any given year, it's – I don't know the exact numbers, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't 80%-plus organic. The acquisitions we tend to make tend to be bolt-on acquisitions that we're then driving growth from. Most of the acquisitions we're making are concert promoters and festivals that we then bring the Ticketing, the Sponsorship components into. Ticketing acquisitions we tend to make are pieces of technology hires not material in any kind of near-term driving of our AOI growth.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to David Joyce with Evercore.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. Couple questions on the Latin American concert front. First, on Rock in Rio, could you provide some more detail there why is it that you're not consolidating until next year? Is it just because there's no activity this year? And what's your growth plans there because they've sort of alternated into some – in different regions? Is that a brand that you're going to take more globally? And then secondarily, you talked about the volume tripling there. Is that just from the new hires or is it – that you've done in the region or has that been from just a heightened level of concert activity, or how should we think about that kind of allocation there? Thank you.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Rock in Rio happens every couple years. So 2019 is the next Rock in Rio. So that's why the business will be active then. It's not much of a business in between. Overall, we look at – we've said on a global basis, we think that now that the artist is unlocked on a global basis and demand in stadiums from Columbia to Cape Town is the same as Detroit. Thanks to the Internet, YouTube and Spotify everybody knows about the new Drake single this morning. So our job is to build this global platform. The major cities around the world where these superstar artists can continue to tour as they look to travel the world and tour more and more markets in South America, in Asia and in Eastern Europe. So, South America is a market we've – we always go slow, we always go down, find partners, get to understand the market, get to understand all the players. And then when we think we can find acquisitions of current partners with great history and operational skills, we tend to look to acquire them and then add our synergies to that market to drive our growth. So we look at Latin America as a strong market overall in the long term. Artists as I said, Coldplay, U2, Metallica, Rihanna, Shakira, most artists now when we look at their global touring, those hundred shows that they may allocate, they're all looking now to say Latin America is a 15 city kind of tour out of the hundred available dates. And we want to make sure we're able to monetize those dates to the markets. And Rock in Rio is by far an incredible asset to build our operations around.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Sundby with William Blair.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. But Joe, just a quick question there, I think, you mentioned that the shift in onsales from Q2 into Q1, how much did that had in the quarter?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Probably now it's just a chunk of the impact for Ticketing. It only impacted our Ticketing segment, and it was a piece of our over-delivery relative to where we thought we would be a couple of months ago.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. But that wouldn't impact the numbers through the end of April, right?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, no. Just – it would be a bit of increase in terms of our Ticketmaster ticket sales through April. Just for some of the – if you phased in one or two of the bigger onsales into Q2 versus Q1. Not a huge impact.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. And then, Michael, I guess any kind of color or is there an initiative that kind of stands out where the extra average spend per fan is coming from this year?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I would say it's more structural. I think over the last few years, we've been adding that DNA to our business. Historically, we were a great concert promoter, and we were a great marketer of tickets and we weren't a great hospitality business. So when we brought our – some outside skillset in, we reorganized our venue business last year to put more focus around the true experience at amphitheaters, put some resources against that. We start to see some real activity and some real buy-in on the local level. So I think the amount of overall initiatives we have across our 50 amphitheaters this year would be at an all-time high in terms of new POS, new product lines, speed to play in the lines, more washrooms, a whole host of initiatives we've put together this year in the quest to grow $2 plus. So, great execution with a new leadership team that comes with the hospitality background foreseeing some real focus across our amphitheaters.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then I guess the investment in Blink Identity, it seems like an interesting concept. Is this kind of how you envision the future of fans entering the – entering a show or – I guess what stands out about this versus maybe like a radio frequency or something like that?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: All right. These are some very talented guys that have come out with what we consider to be a very interesting technology that lets you tie in your overall identity to the tickets. And for us, it's part of what we've tried to redefine Ticketmaster as over the past several years. And one of the reasons why we do think it's more successful now is, we're willing to look at outside technologies, outside partners, how it is we can bring them in and enhance the overall fan experience, make things more effective for the venues. Whether this becomes the solution for everything or whether this becomes interesting product for a number of clients is to be determined. We just think it's the important part of where we're moving the Ticketmaster DNA to.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then I guess just last one from me. It seems like over the last couple years, you've experimented with some kind of unique offerings such as the $20 National Concert Week, the Festival Passports. Just wondering if you could maybe talk about the fan appetite out there for some of these differentiated types of packages, and maybe how you kind of see these type of offerings evolving in the future?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: We're in the same business of hotels and airlines. Midnight, the product is not worth anything. So, our job is to continually figure out ways to get that casual fan, who wasn't going to end up going to that show, to think about going to our show. So we've got an incredible database set. We've got a great internal team. And their mission the last couple of years is to wake up and figure out how do we create these holistic scale offers that can drive casual fans to come to the venue and at scale. Because of our business, we can deliver those offerings with real impact. So we think they're very effective. You'll see us continually look to be in that business of consumer offerings that are going to drive both the low end, whether it's a price discount or a high-end on a VIP experience. We think lots of opportunity to keep delivering segment value offers to our audience at scale.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll go to our next question from John Tinker with Gabelli.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Hi. Your cousins at Pandora tried and failed to enter the ticketing business. Spotify is emerging as the leading streaming company, and they're beginning to look a little more at ticketing. Is there anything you see there at all which could suggest they will do a better job?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I don't even know what that means, Tinker. I know Daniel pretty well. I don't see much of a ticketing company over at Spotify, so it was a nice jump. But what are you asking?
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: No. I'm asking if you think they could actually get in the ticketing business or if there's any evidence that this is real. I mean, the Pandora guys really I don't think had any idea what they're doing. That's why the new team have gone out of it, whereas Spotify has been pretty effective. Their problem is that they're not structured to make money. They have to change their business model and they've talked openly about that issue and how they need to add new services and ticketing is an obvious area. I just wonder if there's any evidence they're actually getting anywhere.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: We think – we've got a ton of respect for Daniel. He's new at the game as we saw yesterday. So, I think, he's got a big mission ahead of him and some staying in his lane, driving the streaming business against the Apples and the Amazons of the world. We have a partnership. We've been doing our API at Spotify like other places for a while. But at the core, I don't think Spotify is someone that's looking to get into our business nor are we looking to get in the streaming business. But we'll look at all those partners. There's some distribution opportunity for some incremental tickets. But at the core, we'll stay in our lane and we think we have lots of opportunity.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Great. Thank you. Good quarter.
Operator: We'll go for our next question to John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the Sponsorship business. One of the things that kind of looking at the growth rates here that kind of jumped out at me was it appears like the new data international side of Sponsorship performed really well this quarter. And I just wanted to ask where you see the runway for that business? As you look at things, do you see that maybe you've gotten a lot of the low hanging fruit on the U.S. side and there's huge opportunities on the international side. I'm just kind of curious to assess the progress you've made the last three or four years on Sponsorship. And has there been a geographic focus and is the runway internationally maybe bigger than we think?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you. We think runway – we think Sponsorship – the same for 14 years, Sponsorships got a lot of runway ahead of it. It is one of the foundations to what we do for a living. It's not an ancillary business, it's what we do. And we think that the wind at our back with experiences, you talk to any CMO, any brand in the marketplace, they're all looking at how do I connect with customers in this new age. And when we tell them we got 91 million and we know where they're going to be on a Thursday and what seat they're going to be in, we have a great platform. So we look at both international, U.S. Canada, we think every day that we – Brazil now with Rock in Rio as we keep building our flywheel of concerts, we think we know that that drives our audience and our sponsorship potential with brands who are hungry for some of their budget to be allocated to this experience space. So what we think – we think the market in the U.S. and Canada we still have a lot of room because it's a market where we continually are able to create great products. We have such a great asset base here. So we think the runway here is different in the sense of it's got a lot of levers around it. We have Lollapalooza and amphitheaters, incredible asset base that still has great runway. International just got good runway because it's new to us in a lot of markets. I mean we have zero in Brazil and next year and in like couple years, we'll have more there, so more about markets international as we've been growing those, we're able to ramp up sponsorship. So higher growth rate from the sake of there was a lower base, but we think both markets will continually have good double digit runway for years to come.
John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. And then just one clarification question I know you talked about the double digit AOI growth for the year. In the fourth quarter, there was kind of the hit on the legal settlement I think of $110 million that you ran through the AOI in that lines, I believe. If we think about that 10% or the double digit growth rate that maybe you're talking to for the year, should we be maybe adjusting that AOI number grossing in higher to reflect that legal settlement? Just trying to put that in context. And then just lastly, just one comment, thank you for the color on the DoJ and The New York Times issue. I thought you guys really provided some useful color there, and thank you for being transparent on that front.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you. We worked hard on it.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. On the AOI, yes, we're talking about adjusted for Songkick. So take last year, add back the $110 million and then the growth comes off of that.
John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session and brings to the end today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 conference call. I will make my comments today excluding the 2017 impacts of the $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year numbers comparable. Live Nation delivered it's seventh consecutive year of record results Live Nation delivered its seventh consecutive year of record results. Revenue was up 24%, AOI up 15% and free cash flow was up 21%. All our divisions concerts, sponsorship, and ticketing delivered their strongest AOI results in the history of the company. We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong consumer demand and robust supply of new and established artists hitting the road from clubs to stadiums. Live is truly a unique entertainment form that cannot be duplicated and creates a lifetime memories that fans are craving for more than ever in this experienced economy. We believe the live business will continue to have strong growth for years to come as fans globally drive demand, artists are touring more, and sponsorship and ticketing benefit from the concerts flywheel. Live Nation continued to grow its global market share in 2017, adding 15 million fans globally for a total of almost 86 million fans, driving concerts revenue up 26% and AOI up 24%. Across all of the artists we work with, we invested $5.6 billion to promote 30,000 shows in 40 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music. Fans, more than ever, find the live experience from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and share the experience with other fans. In the U.S. alone, over the past 10 years consumer spending on experiences has grown $5 billion per year, and we believe this ongoing trend will continue driving a structural increase in demand for concerts globally. In 2017, we built our leadership position across our business, with double-digit fan growth in both North America and internationally, and across arenas, stadiums, festivals, theaters and clubs. In addition to growing our show count and attendance, our pricing and on-site initiatives also continued to grow our AOI. Average ticket prices for our shows increased by 5% in 2017, amounting to over $250 million as artists more effectively captured the true value from their shows. Once at the show, average per-fan spending grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spending grew by 9% to over $24 per head as we added more high-end products, improved the quality of our food and beverage and offered increased points of sale. The strength of our business is continuing into 2018 with confirmed arena, amphitheater and stadium shows through February 19 up 7% compared to this time last year. Overall, we expect a very strong year across our amphitheaters, arenas and festivals with some decline in stadiums on a year-over-year basis. Given our plans to further monetize our fan relationships, I expect this will translate into a continued strong growth in concerts AOI in 2018. In our sponsorship division, we grew our high-margin business 18% and AOI 13% in 2017. Throughout 2017 our top strategic sponsors have been a key driver of our growth, as our 50-plus sponsors that spend over $1 million per year, collectively spent $285 million to reach our fans, up 19% from last year. Sponsorship at our festivals grew 20%, this growth was driven by our new deals with brands including American Express, American Eagle, Samsung and Amazon Web Services. All this reinforces the power of our platform of 86 million fans, and the continued shift by brands to invest in the live experience. Our research indicates that 90% of brands think that Live Nation can help them reach millennials, and almost 70% of fans say they are more likely to be receptive to brand messaging at concerts. With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship revenue for the year already committed, we are confident we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for this year. Ticketmaster continued growing its leadership in ticketing in 2017, with GTV up 15% and total platform GTV of $30 billion, delivering 500 million tickets to fans in 29 countries. This drove our 17% increase in ticketing revenue and AOI growth of 12%. The Ticketmaster platform continues to demonstrate its effectiveness in selling tickets to fans, with the fourth quarter being our top quarter ever, selling over 50 million fee-bearing tickets which delivered over $4 billion in GTV. Our number one priority at Ticketmaster in 2017 was building products to better serve the artist community. Music accounts for 80% of Ticketmaster's GTV growth in recent years, making it imperative for us to extend our focus from venues to those artists who are filling the venues. First among those product successes last year was Verified Fan, a key step in giving artists greater control of how their tickets are sold. Through the year, we worked with over 80 artists on Verified Fan, selling 3 million tickets and saving fans over $100 million relative to what they would have spent on the secondary market to buy these tickets. As we look to 2018, it will continue to be a top priority to evolve Verified Fan, while also building out a full suite of services that continue to give artists greater control of how their tickets are priced and distributed. At the same time, we've also continued to improve our marketplace, already by far the largest ticketing marketplace in the world. We remain focused on building the inventory available to fans, adding new clients and expanding our secondary listings. Adding third-party events enabled Ticketmaster in North America to increase by over 25% the number of events for which it sold in 2017, and further reinforced our marketplace as a one-stop solution for fans needing tickets. Ticketmaster continues to have success in 2018 as ticket sales are up 5% through February 19, positioning us for another year of growth. In 2017, we again delivered strong growth through our flywheel strategy, growing our global concerts business, and thereby driving growth in our high margin on-site, sponsorship and ticketing businesses. This strategy has consistently delivered for several years now, creating shareholder value through double-digit AOI and free cash flow growth. We believe that the combination of macro trends and our demonstrated ability to execute provide great confidence in our ability to grow the business for many years to come. In 2018, I expect us to further consolidate our global concerts position while enhancing our on-site hospitality business and capturing additional pricing opportunities. On sponsorship business, we will continue driving double-digit growth with more brands looking for that direct connection with music fans, and a more effective Ticketmaster marketplace along with further alignment with artists should continue to build on Ticketmaster's success. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe, to take you through additional details on our fourth quarter, and divisional performance.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first concerts. As Michael said in 2017, we grew attendance by 21% to a record 86 million fans, once again promoting the vast majority of the top global tours, including six artists who each sold over a 1 million tickets for concerts during the year. Looking at the markets, the North America attendance was up 13% over 54 million fans and show count was up 14%. Internationally, attendance was up 39% and show count is up 11%. Attendance was up across most of our venue types with arenas, stadiums and theaters, and clubs, each growing attendance by over 4 million fans for the year, and with each of these venue type increasing both show count and attendance per show. Only amphitheater attendance, coming off a record 2016 was off slightly as we saw several acts playing stadiums or indoors, last year. Globally, we also continued growing our festival portfolio, adding 12 festivals to give us a global portfolio of 97 festivals in 14 countries. As a result, we increased festival attendance by 14% to over 8 million fans and now have 27 festivals that each attracted over 100,000 fans last year. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, concerts revenue was up 53%, while AOI was down $12 million, largely due to timing of prepaid marketing spend, which was up $16 million year-on-year. As Michael said, we're optimistic that we will continue growing concerts AOI in 2018, we already have five artists who have sold over 500,000 tickets for shows this year, and show count is looking strong for the amphitheaters and arenas. Plans are also in place for continued growth of on-site spending which we expect to grow another $2 per fan in 2018. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business, in 2017, our international business, particularly Germany and across Asia, was a large driver of our sponsorship growth, with revenue up 30%, while North America grew 13%. Both sponsorship and online advertising contributed consistently with revenue of 19% and 16% respectively. For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 11% and AOI was up 7%, as we comped against a 2016 fourth quarter that had revenue growth of 22%. Finally, Ticketmaster, global GTV was up 6% for both the quarter and year-to-date driven by GTV, which was up 17% and 15% for the quarter and year respectively. Primary GTV which accounts for over 85% of overall fee-bearing in GTV was up 17% for the quarter and 15% for the full year. Secondary GTV was up 18% for the quarter and up 16% for the full year. We continued our shift to mobile ticketing over the year with mobile ticket sales up 35% accounting for 33% of our ticket sales in 2017, and we also grow our app installed by 37% to 43 million. At the same time, we improved conversion rates across our platforms, up double digits on both mobile and desktop for both primary and secondary tickets. And on margins, as we expected on the last call, adjusted for our legal settlement and legal fees associated with the lawsuit, our AOI margin for the year would have been in the 20% range consistent with 2016. As Michael mentioned, ticket sales through February 2019 were up 5% and we expect Ticketmaster to be deliver mid-single digit ticket growth for the full year. In summary, 2017 was a great year across all our businesses and we expect 2018 to continue the trend. From a phasing standpoint, we expect the majority of our growth to come in Q2 and Q3, particularly as we deliver on our on-site fan spending and sponsorship initiatives. As a result, Q1 AOI looks to be largely in line with 2017 results. On FX, we ended up with a 1% or less impact on AOI and revenue for 2017. And at this point, we don't see more than a 1% to 2 % impact for 2018. I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with our results for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 42% to $2.5 billion. Concerts contributed the majority of the revenue growth, up 53% with increased arena and stadium activity. Ticketing revenue was up 21% from higher primary and secondary ticket sales. As we had previously announced, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we accrued a $110 million legal settlement in our ticketing segment that reduced our operating income, AOI and net income for the fourth quarter and full year. This resulted in a consolidated AOI loss of $23 million for the quarter, compared to what would have been income of $87 million without the legal settlement. Our operating loss of $202 million in the fourth quarter largely driven by the legal settlement along with a $20 million goodwill impairment in concerts related to our artists services business. Net loss for the quarter was $191 million. The legal settlement and goodwill impairment were the primary drivers of this reduction. However, results were positively impacted by a $56 million income tax benefit, related to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform. Moving on to our 2017 full-year results. Revenue was $10.3 billion, a 24% increase over 2016. All of our segments, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing delivered double-digit revenue growth in 2017. The majority of our revenue increase was driven by concerts, up 26% from increased show count and attendance globally across arenas, stadiums and theaters and clubs. Ticketing revenue was up 17% from higher global primary ticket volume driven by concerts, and sponsorship and advertising revenue was at 18% from new sponsorship programs and higher online advertising. AOI was $625 million for the 2017 full-year or $735 million without the legal settlement impact. AOI in 2016 was $640 million. Our growth excluding the legal settlement was again across all segments. Concerts AOI was up 24% as a result of increased show count and attendance along with higher ancillary revenue per-fan at our amphitheaters. Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew by 13%, driven by higher sponsorship and online activity. And our ticketing segment grew excluding the litigation settlement from higher primary and secondary sales. Operating income was $91 million, down from the $195 million we reported last year, again driven by the legal settlement and goodwill impairment in 2017. And our net loss for full-year 2017 was $6 million, down $9 million compared to last year. For the full year, we recorded $92 million of accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest from certain acquisition-related put arrangements that impacts the calculation of earnings per share. This amount increased for the projection of third quarter due to finalization of the value of certain puts that were exercised in the quarter. We currently expect accretion of approximately $75 million in total for 2018 based on our current holdings, which will be fairly consistently spread across quarters. Amortization of non-repeatable ticketing contract advances for 2017 was $85 million compared to $86 million in 2016, including the impact of purchase accounting. We currently expect 2018 to be in line with this. Beginning in 2018, as a result of FASB's new standard on revenue recognition, we will now recognize clients' royalties and non-recoupable advances as a reduction to revenue in our ticketing segment, while the remaining revenue streams of the company will not be impacted. We will also have no change in the timing of when we recognize revenue. When we report 2018, we will apply this change to all periods presented for comparability. Overall, the impact of 2017 is a reduction of our total revenue of 6%. It will be no impact to our AOIs or operating incomes as a result of these changes. Full details of the impact to 2017 and 2016 can be found in Note 1 of our 2017 10-K. Turning to our balance sheet, as of December 31, we had total cash of $1.8 billion, including $769 million in ticketing client cash and $608 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $448 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $623 million in 2017, up from $597 million last year due to increased working capital. Free cash flow adjusted was $334 million or 53% of AOIs compared to $368 million or 58% of AOI in 2016. This metric is also impacted by the legal settlement and 2017 would have been $444 million or 60% without that. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $227 million, evenly split between maintenance and revenue generating items. The increase this year was primarily due to technology enhancements in venue and festival improvements. For 2018, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million, with about half of this on revenue generating expenditures. Our total net debt as of December 2017 was $2.3 billion with a weighted average cost of 3.9%. And finally, as we look forward to 2018, our deferred revenue for future shows, a key leading indicator for concerts was $816 million at the end of 2017, up 13% compared to the $722 million at the same point last year. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Brandon Ross with BTIG.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: (20:24) Ticketmaster. One, there's a story out there this afternoon that the Cowboys will take a 15% stake in SeatGeek and opt out of the NFL Ticketmaster deal. I guess SeatGeek also took venues in New Orleans. How do you size them up as a competitive threat there? Then on 2017, just trying to get a sense of what the organic growth would have been had you not had the legal fees associated with the Songkick Settlement. Calculating that it's about 17%, is that accurate? And then finally you've spoken a lot about Verified Fan and raising ticket prices, and we've seen that this summer with a little bit of push back from the fan communities, but how do you see that impacting your financials for the year, specifically those objectives? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey, Brandon, it's Joe, I'll take the first two and Michael can take the last one. On the Cowboys, I saw the same article as you did. I guess first of all just looking at the NFL broadly, I think we feel very good about our position with the NFL and the teams, as you know, they're working with us to launch digital ticketing for the first time, any league on a very broad basis. So, we think they're a great partner with that. We're aligned with them on the secondary as their official marketplace, we get all the links from their websites, we get all the season ticketholder inventory posted to our secondary. And then by competing with SeatGeek and others, we think will end up with the vast, vast majority of all of the teams doing their primary ticketing with us. I think, hard to comment on a specific thing, but what I will say is that, what matters to us most in general is what's the business model and what's the scalability of the business model. We spend a lot of time working on how do we make sure we have a very competitive business model, talk a lot about our flywheel and the different pieces of the business model, and as we go into every negotiation, we ask how do we make money? How do we scale this business? And how do we see the overall flywheel for growth? So, when I hear stories as you did about competitors giving substantial portions of their equity to get a contract, to us that would generally imply that it's not very scalable, which gives us more comfort with it. And frankly also sends a message out in the marketplace, I assume if you're the next guy talking to them, you're asking where your big chunk of equity is. So, if anything I think it seems that it makes it harder for them to scale if those reports are true.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Organic growth?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: On the organic growth point, we haven't broken it out exactly, but yes, if you back out the Songkick, generally what we've seen in the past is, is that of our total growth, 75% to 80% of its organic, as you know we're acquisitive with a lot of little tuck-in acquisitions, but 75% to 80% of the growth that you see would be organic. So, it would be in the back out Songkick in the low teens AOI organic growth.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Okay. And then just on Verified Fan?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, it's Michael, Brandon, Verified Fan, we're thrilled with our launch. It's a new idea for artists, we're happy in 2017, we had some of the biggest in the world from Springsteen to Taylor, U2 adopt the idea of trying to lock down your ticket directly to your fan at the price you wanted. So, we saw a great success in getting fans, the ticket direct at the price, always still going to be secondary tickets, that wasn't the main goal. Main goal was, can we convince artists that if they start pricing the house right, increasing their P1s, we can then also look at how we can deliver those P1s directly to the fan. And over time, we believe through digital ticketing and technology, the artist and Ticketmaster will continue to be able to deliver tickets directly to registered fans at prices artists believe and agree on, and for us that's the way we make the pie the biggest for both of us. So, we had a lot of artists on Verified Fan and we expect it to grow this year in 2018.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Thanks very much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. Maybe just following up on the ticketing side, but on the other hand, if you can, Michael I guess or Joe if you could comment on Amazon's restructuring I guess in the U.S. and UK, and perhaps what this actually might mean for you in terms of market share on the secondary side, that would be great? And then just a point of clarification, for your ticketing guidance, when you talked about mid-single digit growth, are you referring to revenue or AOI? And what sort of growth assumptions should we be making? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Amy, this is Joe. On Amazon, frankly we see the same things that you do that they have decided to pull back in the UK and the U.S. for now. I don't know that it was ever as much about secondary. So, we don't see a big share shift there. Most of the foray that they had in the UK seem to be primary related. They're obviously a competitor or player out there that we respect a huge amount and we'll see how it plays out. I think they learned some of the complexities of the business and hard to say what happens next with them. In terms of the ticket guidance, that was about ticket count. So, I don't think we were guiding exactly the revenue and the other pieces yet as you know and Kathy mentioned that will go through revenue recognition changes. So, I think it's a bit premature to get into the revenue side of it.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it, okay. That's helpful.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Hi, thank you. Two questions for me. One is, in the past you've talked about improving sellout, and I guess in theory the more shows you promote, the harder it is to improve that metric. So, can you talk about what you're seeing from a sellout perspective and to what extent are you seeing incremental success from improvements in data and technology?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. No problem. So, I wouldn't, John, say so much improved sellouts has reduced the number of unsold tickets for any given show, meaning upon average shows that 25%, 30% of the tickets not sold out, it's every 3 point or 4 point reduction in that, that we can get. That's a big benefit to the artists, big benefit to our overall flywheel strategy. So, we are absolutely seeing continued improvement, we look at it as is, our job is to make sure we're filling the shelves, we're getting people to show up and we're getting people when they show up to convert. So as we talk about all of the elements, each of those improved substantially through 2017 and data was absolutely a big part of it, as we get better and better at targeting with our marketing, targeting better with our search optimization, as well as improving the experience in driving conversion when you are at the mobile sites or on that desktop.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks, Joe. Maybe separately, just on festivals, can you talk about the incremental increase you're expecting this year that I guess with the scalability on the sponsorship side, are new festivals more profitable than they have been in the past?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: It's Michael. It's a pretty broad statement as you know, we have over 90 festivals in varying degrees of sizes and scales and some of them are start-ups and some of them are Lollapaloozas and established, so there is no kind of simple way of looking at, are they growing or more profitable, we look at the ones that either are existing in the main markets we have, we look to build on those and the big ones that you know about the Lollapaloozas, et cetera, are doing fabulous. And then we have a whole host of either start-up or middle ones that we are in the process of growing and maximizing like BottleRock's. So we look at a very portfolio and a market approach to festivals. We'd like to have kind of covered in all areas from start-ups to established with different growth rates.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. You mentioned amp attendance was down slightly in 2017, is there anything to indicate this might be a longer term change or is this mostly just a function of tough comp and the mix of touring acts? And then just as a follow-up, you guided to another $2 per fan growth in on-site spend, can you just discuss some of the drivers of that growth for 2018 relative to last year? Thanks.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. The amps we're seeing no trend that's relevant in 2017. If we look at 2018, we think we're going to have an increase in 2018 over 2017 and have a strong year in amps. So, we don't look at anything that would worry us, if anything the trend in amps over the last five years has been on the upswing, we're very, very bullish on the amps as a business, we continue to look to expand the amps, acquire new ones, build new ones, invest in them, they're a incredible piece of business line, and we're very bullish on them and we think 2018 will be a great year. As far as on-site spending?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. On-site spending, again, we're going to continue to do a lot of what we've been doing, continuing to get more and more granular, which unlocks the next round of sales, so it's continuing to add more points of sale, limiting those volumes for particularly in the middle of the show when you have the intermission, it's focusing on making sure you've got the right product mix at each one of those points of sale, optimizing pricing against your competitive environment, and what you see a price elasticity of demand is, and then it's also continuing to roll out at a bit higher scale, some of our on-site experiences and VIP offerings.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. So, Kathy was kind enough to call out the growth and the deferred revenue side. I don't want to suggest this is a near-term risk, but maybe, if you can talk about the longer term nature of this threat. As I look at the Spotify numbers and Apple in terms of these interactive streaming subscriptions that consumers are lapping up. It seems to be going a long way towards supplanting sort of the demise of physical music sales. Do you get nervous at all about that ultimately crimping the supply side of your business model, meaning the artists just have other ways to make money by just getting a royalty check or a check from their record label as opposed to going on the road and tour?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey, Jason, our deferred, Joe will explain you, you have it backwards, it's a good day when our deferred is up.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: No, no. What I'm saying is, the deferred means nothing is eminent, but I'm wondering if you step back, how do we sort of square this growth with these services with the supply side of your business model?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Okay. But just – again to set the facts straight, deferred revenue was up which mean we sold more tickets for shows in 2017 for 2018 shows than we sold in 2016 for 2017 shows. So that would be one of our key leading indicators that we were going to have another year of growth in 2018, I just make sure we got that straight for everybody. But to your point on the ticket supply, the supply, your correlation again would be I think, we would look at it quite differently, I think history says that the artist was very reliant on record deals with $50 million, $60 million, $70 million record deals in the old days.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So for many, many years you toured to sell records and records was a high piece of what a superstar income was derived. Over the last 10 years that's dramatically declined obviously and today we're streaming even more successful artist like Drake who maybe the most Spotify-ed streamed artist in the world, is going to make 95% of the money, his income on the road. So, at the end of the day the artists, we're thrilled that streaming is exploding, the more artists -the more consumers around the world that continue to consume music and find out about superstars and discover music is great for us, and the best part is the artist ultimately still looks the road as the ultimate way that he is going to drive most of his income on an annual basis to build his audience and connect with his fans. So, we think it's a great correlation that the business is healthy and the artist has great pipes distribution to spread his art, but ultimately we believe that the trend will continue where being on the road it is very important to his economics.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So the more Spotify grows, the better it is for you, so you'll (34:36)?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Absolutely.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Tinker with Gabelli.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Hi. Thank you. In terms of breaking out your ticketing, and so about 15% of this is from secondary. What would you estimate your share now do you think is in that market? And that this implies that I think you probably have about 300 million, StubHub reports about $1 billion?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, it sounds like you've done the math, John?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's for the quarter John, is that your estimates, because I think we talked last year already, we were over $1 billion in GTV, so this year we'd be well over that. I think at this point we're in – somewhere in the 20%s, but as we talk now for some time we're not – we're more obsessed with the Verified Fan and the pricing and really bringing the value on to the primary than we are at the exactness of a secondary share, we want to make sure we've got great product for the consumer, which we have we believe with our integrated inventory. We want to make sure we've got a very effective technology and product for artists and for teams. And we think that over time that helps create the most effective and successful marketplace.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: And more of a generic question to Michael, congratulations on your joining the board of Sirius, who with Liberty Sirius of just now trying to basically buy 40% of iHeart in bankruptcy. How do you see Live Nation, is there any involvement with the radio business in anyways, it's that something you spend a lot of money advertising on or is it just another small part of your ecosystem?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: You're good, John. You love to tie these together, but I can't give you much on it. Sirius is an interesting board, it was something for me to experience given the Liberty family, but other than it's in the Liberty family it's continually business as usual. On our side, we look at Spotify, and Sirius, and Apple, and all of those platforms as ongoing promotion tools, that we'll use in our business. But today it was just day a Michael Rapino decision to be on the Sirius board to get a little bit of an exposure to a new business model, nothing else to read into it.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: And how much money does Live spend on advertising on the radio side, or is it really just not that important now?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, it's not that important. We don't – we've been spending most of our as we said out loud for the last few years, our conversion in selling more tickets to the concerts has been about direct marketing and online. So we've shifted over the last few years most of our kind of traditional advertising to more online mobile advertising, which has been effective. Not to say iHeartRadio and radio stations around the world aren't still important to the artists especially when they're on cycle and launching a new album or single. So we do spend some money on radio still and it's one piece of the pie, but we shifted most – a majority of our advertising for concerts now is more online and direct.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Joyce with Evercore.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. Two questions please. First is on the ancillary on-site spend, guiding to another $2 increase. How much of your platform currently can use these new initiatives that you've been working on delivering to the seat in the extra kiosks and what have you. I'm just wondering how much more of a rollout you're going to be looking for, and I know you've talked about getting that figure up to about $30 in time? And then secondly on sponsorship and advertising, I was just wondering with the couple of the marketers that you called out, are they incremental to your sponsorship universe or they've been adding to current contracts, and what's going to be – how do we parse out the growth going forward? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. David, this is Joe. I'll take both of these, on the ancillary spend I think you got it right at the end, which is we continue to believe that we get to $30, and that's just the first target we have and then we reassess and go from there. Every year we've got a wide range of initiatives that we're testing in a handful of amps. We've rolled out to a broader set of amps and we have every amp running with, and then we'll do the same this year. So, we'll take some of the stuff that was successful last year and we'll expand it, and we'll be trying some new things this year. But everything that we've seen has shown that we continue to track right where we thought we would be in terms of adding a couple dollars a year and continuing to chug towards that initial target. On the sponsorship and advertising, the brands that we called out are a mix, some of them have been working with us for a while, and are adding new ways that they want to try to reach some of our fans and some of them are new. We've focused you I think on a couple of areas: One is looking for a major sponsors, what's the continued rate of growth of those sponsors, which was way about 20% last year; and then the other is looking at some of our more direct on-site spend and how much does that continue to grow. So, I think those will continue to be the couple of things that we focus you on.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: And I apologize if I missed it, but do have a domestic versus international split for both sponsorship and advertising contribution in 2017?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So I think yeah in my comments what we said is, is that international revenue was up 30% driven by Germany in particular and across Asia for the business and North America grew 13%, and that's both sponsorship and online were up pretty consistently with revenue up 19% in sponsorship and 16% online.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah, thanks. Kathy, a simple question here. In ticketing you – in the fourth quarter you basically reported a breakeven AOI, so the entire charge was in there, so if you back the charge out, is it fair to say that the adjusted AOI would have been $109.8 million, is that fair, without the charge?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, that's right.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. So that's actually a pretty strong quarter for ticketing?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Correct.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: On the bottom line and top line. And then secondly, I mean, Joe you cited the pre-marketing expenses of $16 million in the quarter. I know seasonally the fourth quarter is never a great bottom line in the concert business, but I mean you added a hell of a lot of revenues in the quarter and don't have much to show for it on the bottom line. Is there something other? Is it just a mix of shows or the expense of the tours that you were out there? I mean, I'm trying to understand the disconnect there.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, and again what I gave you on the marketing was just the incremental year-on-year. So yes, every year is a lot that was just happened to be a big growth Q4 for the marketing that as you know we have to expense. I think the other is just as we continue to get bigger and bigger, right, we're at 86 million fans, 30,000 shows, it was only a few years ago that we were at 50 million fans. So we have grown very rapidly, tremendously. A lot of that growth if you look at it, I think continues to be very Q3, Q4 driven. So that does – as your organization grows, that does put a bit of a cost burden on your slower volume quarters, in your first, in your four, in terms of just their ability to drive revenue relative to their costs, that then disproportionately comes in more in Q2 and Q3.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Ryan Sundby with William Blair.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So last call I guess it sounded like to me that the move to digital with NFL was kind of step one, then the hope was that you could get a broader roll out to kind of other major stadiums and arenas in 2018 and 2019. But just kind of hoping to kind of get a refresh on that view, how has the rollout gone so far, and maybe some thoughts or expectations around how many tickets or percentage of tickets you think will be sold digitally this year?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, this is Joe. I don't think we've gone out with any specific numbers. So we're probably not going to do that right now. But we'll start to deploy the digital ticketing at our amps this summer and that will be the first real use of them that will go into some of the NFL in the fall, and then really get broader and expand from there in 2019. So, you'll start to see again I think us doing it with ourselves first and then it will be expanding at the NFL level, and then at other specific team levels in other arenas.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. And then I guess just following up on the question on SeatGeek, I guess we heard a bit for the New Orleans teams maybe actually come in at a loss there. And while I guess they might make money on the Cowboys deal, I guess like you said it's a tough business giving away equity if that's the cost. So, I guess I understand your comments on scalability, but in the near term does this put pressure on Ticketmaster margins or do you think you partners kind of realize that maybe these terms aren't sustainable longer term?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes, it's Michael, we've never had a 100% of the NFL team. So, historically, there's always competitors that are TicketsNow and Axxess and other guys who've been at the table when these teams are up. So, SeatGeek's the latest we expected that as others. We knew that when we secure the overall relationship with the NFL that the competitors would then use those funds they didn't use to win kind of the national deal to go local, that's the usual model. We believe in the end, we're going to continue having close to the 31 teams, we'll lose two or three as we historically have done. And we expected SeatGeek or our competitors to be there at the table with the teams as they're up. We've renewed what we needed to renew in 2017 and we're on course on 2018 for renewal. So, I just would say not trying to discredit or competitors, they're always there, they've always been there, there's always a competitor at a sports teams door looking to challenge, and we don't see that any different this year than we have historically. And a competitor like SeatGeek is probably going to overpay, take some lost leaders to build their business. We just again, I think, Joe's point was, we look to both the New Orleans deal and the Cowboys deal, we know exactly what they were offered. You wouldn't want us to win that deal. We don't believe that it's a sustainable model, what that they can offer that to 30 teams, you only have so many pieces of equity. So, we expected them to be strong on a couple of teams or three, and we expect to win the majority as we have in business as usual. We're very, very happy about our overall NFL deal, because we redefine that deal to be much more in our favor going forward on how we can actually drive our secondary business. So, overall we're thrilled with the overall relationship of the NFL economics for Ticketmaster both the league and the teams and didn't see anything new that we don't see or haven't seen historically with the competitive bidding process of the ticketiness.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for the color.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Live Nation had its best third quarter ever and 2017 is on track to deliver another record year results across revenue, AOI and free cash flow. For the quarter, revenue was up 12%, AOI up 10%. For nine months to-date revenue was up 19%, AOI was up 16%, and free cash flow was up 15%. All our divisions, concerts, ticketing and advertising, each delivered their strongest quarterly AOI results ever. Our concerts business is our flywheel, attracting over 30 million fans to shows globally in the quarter, which then drove record results in our onsite ticketing and advertising business. Through October, we have sold 80 million tickets for concerts in 2017, up 20% year-on-year. With our strength in concert attendance growth, we are also seeing similar success in onsite sponsorship, ticketing businesses giving confidence that 2017 will be another year of record results for Live Nation overall and for each of its divisions. Digging deeper into concerts, strong global demand for concerts through the third quarter drove a 16% increase in attendance to 65 million of fans at our 20,000 shows in 40 countries. While growing our show count, we've increased the revenue generated by each show. We do this first by growing attendance per show, which is up 6% overall so far this year, again led by arenas and stadiums, each delivering strong increases in fans per show. And secondly, we work with artists to better align the pricing for their best tickets with market value. This yielded an average 9% increase in front-of-the-house ticket prices across our amphitheaters, arena and stadium shows so far this year. This summer, we also saw the benefit from onsite initiatives at our amphitheaters, increasing our average revenue per fan by 9% to almost $24. This is now a nearly 20% increase over the past two years, as we have driven substantial improvements across food and beverage, VIP and parking. With the success of the concert flywheel, we're promoting more shows for more fans, more effectively pricing and selling tickets and delivering a better experience than ever. As a result, we will spend over $5 billion producing concerts this year, making Live Nation far and away the largest financial partner to musicians. With this, we expect to deliver record results in our concerts business this year. This growth in concert demonstrates the power of Live across the globe, as more fans are attending live shows and making it a top entertainment choice and the only non-duplicatable music option. In our high-margin sponsorship business, we have continued double-digit growth this year with revenue up 20% and AOI up 15% year-to-date, as we delivered our best quarterly results ever for our sponsorship business. With over 1,000 sponsors across our onsite and online platform, Live Nation is a global leader in music sponsorship, providing brands with opportunities to reach our core audience. Onsite sponsorship continues to be a key growth driver and year-to-date, our festival sponsorship is up 20%, while our sponsorship per fan is up 8% as we continue to find innovative way at scale to connect brands with over 8 million fans attending 95 festivals worldwide. Our other key growth initiative continues to be deepening and broadening our strategic brand relationships with over 50 sponsors each spending more than $1 million on our platform from onsite to fan direct engagement. Collectively, the committed spend by this group is up 24% to over $275 million for the year, accounting for approximately 80% of our overall sponsorship and advertising. With 95% of our expected advertising revenue for the year now contracted, we expect full AOI growth in the low teens for the business. Ticketmaster continues to build its position as a global ticket marketplace leader with 14% growth to-date in global fee-bearing GTV. Ticketmaster will deliver almost 500 million tickets worth approximately $28 billion GTV across 29 countries this year, making it the world's largest such marketplace. And the success of the marketplace is stronger than ever, as all three quarters in 2017 have been amongst our top 10 quarters ever. Underlining this growth is our product innovation and this has been an important quarter for us as we have scaled our Verified Fan product and announced our first league-wide conversion to digital ticketing. Ticketmaster's Verified Fan has developed a proprietary process, leveraging algorithms which separates true fans from bots and delivers the tickets to fans and drive a 90% reduction in the number of tickets ending up on the secondary market. During the third quarter, we substantially scaled the product and have now worked with over 60 artists and Broadway shows, including Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, Hamilton and Bruce Springsteen on Broadway. As a result, by the end of the year, I expect we will deliver 3 million tickets to Verified Fans, saving them $100 million relative to buying on secondary sites after bots got the tickets first. We also announced our digital ticketing rollout with the NFL in September, and starting next season, all NFL game tickets will be digital. This will allow us to identify the fans attending the games, understand in much greater detail the behavior of these fans, reduce fraud and frustrated fans, and work with our clients to create new profit streams in ticketing. As importantly, these products come as we have a continued success in our core operations. Our mobile and desktop platforms continue to provide an improved online experience with 34% growth in mobile ticket sales this year and double-digit improvements in conversion on both mobile and desktop. And at the same time, our open strategy continues selling more tickets for clients off-platform, up 20% year-to-date with almost 10 million tickets sold. Overall, Ticketmaster's results are validating our dual strategy of delivering a great marketplace for fans to buy tickets, while providing the greatest value to venues, teams and artists, looking to control their tickets and maximize the value of their events. By continuing to do both effectively, I expect us to deliver high-single-digit growth in ticketing AOI this year. As we approach the end of 2017, we're confident that our strong performance will deliver another year of record top line, AOI, and free cash flow. All of our businesses, concerts, advertising and ticketing, have delivered growth year-to-date and based on key operating metrics, we expect each to deliver record revenue and AOI for the full year. As we look forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue to seek global consolidation of our concerts and ticketing business and for further growth in advertising and ticketing from the concerts flywheel. With that, I will turn over to Joe to take you through additional details on divisional performance.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue in the third quarter was up 11% and AOI was up 18%. This growth was driven by a 10% increase in show count and almost 30 million fans attending our events in the quarter. So far this year, we've had 65 million fans attend our concerts, up 9 million from this time last year. Our international markets have been particularly strong this year adding 5.5 million fans, while the U.S. has grown by 3.5 million. Arenas and stadiums have driven much of this growth globally adding 7 million fans, while festivals and theaters and clubs also contributed to these increases. Underlying its growth is an expanding group of artists touring with us, many of whom are now touring across multiple markets or globally, including six artists who have each performed in front of over 1 million fans so far this year. U2, Coldplay, Guns N' Roses, Depeche Mode, Bruno Mars and Metallica all of whom we work with globally. Given ticket sales through October for shows this year, we're now expecting to have almost 85 million fans attend 29,000 shows in 2017, tremendous growth from our 71 million fans last year. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. Sponsorship and advertising revenue for the third quarter grew by 16% and AOI was up 13%. Our growth for the year has been well-balanced between sponsorship and online advertising with both parts of the business growing revenue and AOI in the double digits year-to-date. From a geographic perspective, both North America and international markets delivered similar AOI growth with international markets delivering the majority of sponsorship growth and North America accounting for much of the online advertising growth. Finally, Ticketmaster, for the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 17% and AOI was up 4%. Global GTV was up 6% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date, driven by fee-bearing GTV, which was up 19% and 14% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Primary GTV, which accounts for approximately 90% of overall fee-bearing GTV was up 18% for the quarter and 14% year-to-date. Approximately 75% of this GTV growth is driven by concerts, much of which is Live Nation shows. Most of the remaining growth is from the art segment driven by the touring of Hamilton and other highly in-demand shows. Secondary GTV was up 29% for the quarter and is now up 15% year-to-date. Here again concerts and the arts are the greatest drivers of our growth, together accounting for about 75% of the increase year-to-date. Overall, our Ticketmaster marketplace is performing well for fans, as Michael noted. More specifically, our marketplace continues to attract more fan visits, 36% for the quarter and 28% year-to-date to almost 4 billion visitors this year. The shift to mobile continues its rapid progress, now accounting for 34% of tickets sold in the third quarter. And as part of the shift to mobile, we increased our installed base of apps to over 40 million, up 38% from this time last year, which positions us well for a shift to digital ticketing. As Michael said for the full year, we expect ticketing AOI growth in the high-single digits. And while margins move around from quarter-to-quarter, excluding one-off legal fees, we expect full year margins in line with last year. In summary, we're confident that 2017 will be another year of record revenue and AOI results overall and for each of our businesses. We also expect to grow our free cash flow enabling us to continue investing in the businesses for ongoing growth. On FX, Q3 revenue and AOI were positively impacted by about 1% with the strengthening of the euro and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. In terms of seasonality, we expect Q4 as a percent of full year AOI to be a little less than it was last year. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon everyone. Starting with our results for the third quarter, revenue was up 12% to $3.6 billion and AOI increased 10% to $335 million. Free cash flow adjusted for the quarter was up 4% to $253 million. As of the end of the third quarter, our concerts-related deferred revenue was $774 million, up from $417 million at the same time last year and includes tickets sold for shows next year. The majority of our revenue growth in the third quarter was driven by concerts, with revenue up 11% from higher show count and attendance globally across arenas, stadiums and theatres and clubs. Ticketing revenue was up 17% from increased ticket volumes, driven by the high demand for concerts. And lastly, sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 16%. AOI growth for the quarter was driven by an 18% increase in concerts AOI from improved operating results of arenas and stadiums. Sponsorship and advertising AOI increased 13% from new sponsorship programs and higher online advertising. And ticketing AOI was up 4% driven by increased ticket sales for concerts. Operating income in the third quarter was $201 million, a 5% increase over last year driven by AOI growth in sponsorship and concerts. Net income was $136 million, up 23% from $111 million in the third quarter last year, driven by the growth in our AOI. Acquisition expenses increased by $18 million in the quarter due to changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration. And income tax expense increased by $12 million for the quarter from our earnings growth internationally. Now, the results for the nine months. Revenue was up 19% to $7.8 billion and AOI increased 16% to $648 million. Free cash flow adjusted for the nine months was $434 million, up 15% from prior year. Revenue growth in the nine months was driven by concerts from increased show count and attendance in stadiums, arenas and theaters and clubs. Ticketing revenue was up 16% from increased primary and retail ticket volume driven by concerts. And sponsorship and advertising grew by 20%. AOI growth for the nine months was driven by double-digit growth in AOI across all three business segments with the largest part of the increase driven from higher concert show activity. Operating income was $293 million compared to $232 million last year. And net income for the nine months was $185 million compared to $104 million last year due to our improved operating results. Income tax expense increased $16 million as we continue to grow our international business profitability. For the nine months, our net foreign exchange rate gains included in other income increased by $8 million compared to 2016. For the quarter, we recorded $21 million of accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest with respect to the calculation of earnings per share. For the full year, we currently estimate that this accretion will be approximately $75 million. And diluted earnings per share for the quarter and the nine months were $0.53 and $0.62, respectively, the highest for each time period in the history of the company. Moving to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.8 billion, including $640 million in ticketing client cash and $513 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $648 million. Our free cash increased due to the growth in AOI along with timing of acquisition activity in 2017 so far. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months was $417 million compared to $120 million in 2016, driven by our higher AOI, increased deferred revenue for future events and the timing of payment of liabilities. Free cash flow adjusted for the nine months as a percentage of AOI is in line with last year. The conversion of AOI to free cash flow for the quarter is off a bit due to bad debt expense last year that reduced AOI, but didn't impact free cash flow. Our total capital expenditures through September 30 were $172 million with 52% spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect total capital expenditures for 2017 to be approximately $220 million with roughly half on revenue-generating CapEx. As of September 30, our total net debt was $2.3 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 3.9%. We also recently received an upgrade from Moody's on our corporate rating from the B1 to Ba3 and on our senior secured facility and bond to Ba1 and B1, respectively. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will take our first question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Joe, I know you don't like to talk about margin percentages, but I'm going to start off with a question on that. For the quarter, you had pretty huge top-line growth there. AOI growth was about 4%. You said for the year to expect flattish margins. Can you just speak to what kind of pressured that margin percentage in the quarter? You, I think, alluded to legal fees in the supplemental. Can you just kind of tell us if that's going to be something that's ongoing? And on Concerts, I think your biggest AOI dollar contributor in the quarter came from there. And you've always kind of said margin growth isn't something to count on in the Concerts division, but it's something that's clearly been happening. If you strip out the per cap expansion, are you growing margin dollars – AOI margin dollars through some of those initiatives that you mentioned such as pricing the house? And is that an opportunity for margin dollars going forward? Or is that just contributing to the overall flywheel? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. I'll take them in reverse order. So on the concert side, yes, obviously, as you said, the per cap growth are the largest contributor to the margin increases on the concert side. I think when you look at the other initiatives, which is both more people at the concert and higher pricing, obviously, since those flow through more directly, they are going to be beneficial to the margin. I think the point that I've always made on the concert business is just when you start with the 90-10 with the artists, you're constrained on where those margins can get to, not that we don't continually work and strive to improve them. And so, I think in the concert side, you're seeing this year, this quarter, the fruit of a lot of work that's been going on for a while, that continue to prove the economics of that business.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And also, just the mix of – we think the concert business has got a great flywheel, onsite, hospitality, huge part of how we're going to keep growing the company. But we also keep growing the business overall on the touring and the concert side, which is the 90-10 part of the equation. So as you're growing your higher margin onsite, beer, food and beverage, no matter how much you grow that, if you do the U2 tours of the world and that grows, when you put those two together, it's hard to move the overall net concert margin. So we just always wanted to be realistic that we're going to continue to grow the onsite, monetize the concert business and lots of runway left. But as you're also growing the global concert, ticket revenue grows, you won't see it so much in margin as you will in AOI cash flow over time.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: And was Artist Nation a contributor – has that been a contributor positively for you guys this year? Since you don't kind of break it out, I'm just curious.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes. I mean it's a high margin in theory business, because it's got no real costs. So it's a higher margin business. It's been fairly stable contributor of AOI to the business.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And then Brandon, on ticketing, again, first the context, we've long said, we don't try to micromanage the results of each division on a quarterly basis. We think that is not in our shareholders best interest. We absolutely look at it on a full year basis. This quarter, we had a handful of things going on, some mix as it relates to international versus North America, some mix within specific customers that were particularly active, and then, as I said, the one-off legal fees. But again, to reiterate the guidance that I gave is that for the full year, absent the one-off legal fees, we expect that our margins would be flat year-on-year. So, I wouldn't have characterized it as you did in terms of the pressure or decline. Those one-off legal fees are associated with the lawsuit that we have underway with Songkick that has been somewhat in the press and disclosed. And we expect, hopefully, to get that resolved and move on, but in the near term, there is a bit of costs associated with that.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. Could you size that very quickly? And then I'm done (23:22)?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, we're not going to give specific numbers on it.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Okay, thank you.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: The structural – the question that Brandon has answered on structural, right, we're growing the business, incredible margin. There's nothing that happened this quarter that's structurally going to change our margin business over time. We continue to renew, drive the business and, overall, we'll meet our margin expectations for the year given a quarter one-off here and there.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. Just a few questions on the recent NFL deal. The release said that Ticketmaster would validate tickets on other NFL license marketplaces. Is this something where you'd expect to get a fee for every ticket validated? And then can you walk through how this deal impacts the sale of primary tickets both for NFL games and then for concerts at NFL stadiums? Thanks.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Joe will take through the – I mean, Joe will take you through the overall Ticketmaster strategy for the last two years we've been outlining and how this is a fulfillment of that.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. So, I mean as we've been talking for a while, Ticketmaster's job is twofold; first and foremost, to provide venues, teams, artists with a great software-as-a-service platform; and secondly, to have a marketplace that is the best place to sell tickets. And as part of that, our open strategy which is making sure on behalf of those teams and artists, to the extent that tickets aren't selling on our platform, that they're selling connected to Ticketmaster in a way that we can still benefit from some of the economics. So the big thing with the NFL deal is, is it's the first move to all-digital ticketing. So, for the first time, every ticket that's done for an NFL game will be a digital ticket, which means we can understand who the fans are, we can understand how those tickets trade, we can start to monetize what happens on other marketplaces, which hasn't historically been done. So I think the way that we think about it is, first and foremost, when the other licensed marketplaces of the NFL have a secondary sale, there are economics that come to the NFL and Ticketmaster for validating those tickets. That's part of what we've always talked about in the past in terms of that money sitting outside of content and Ticketmaster's P&L and the desire to start to shift some of that money, so that those who are spending to put on the games and other events start to benefit from it. So, that's really the underlying piece of it. In terms of primary, our expectation is, is every primary ticket continues to be available on Ticketmaster. To the extent that we can sell incremental tickets and the teams are looking for other avenues to sell incremental tickets, then Ticketmaster will absolutely work with other platforms on an open basis to make it available for – some of the tickets available for sale on those platforms as well. And to be clear, the deal with the NFL is around the NFL games. And so, as we're talking about the validation or anything with primary, those are the events that we're talking about.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just shifting a bit. On your ancillary spend, can you say where you are with onsite per fan at your festivals or even how that's tracked year-to-date relative to your amphitheatres? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. The festival sales per fan continue to do well. It's a much more fragmented and differentiated. As we've said for a while, our first focus is really getting the amphitheatres, which tend to be a more consistent set of 40-odd buildings that we control with one food and beverage provider and similar tours, similar experiences across the portfolio. So, that's been our primary focus over the past couple of years in terms of driving the numbers. Because our festivals are much more spread geographically, genre, whether the audience is over 21, under 21, more distributed in terms of how the food and beverage is provided, the numbers don't flow as easily. And as we're getting the amphitheaters further along, we're turning more of our attention to festivals, but we're happy with how they've been progressing in the recent years given what we've been able to do with them.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to John Tinker with Gabelli.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Can you hear?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Kind of.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Hello.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Can hear you now.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: I'm sorry, bad line. I noticed that the international fans is particularly strong. Are there any countries which are really sort of kicking in right now or is it evenly distributed or are you focusing on any one particular market?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. I think it – the numbers suggest our thesis on why this business will do well continually, it's a global business now. An artist – superstar artist can travel most countries in the world and sell out arenas or stadiums. So whether you have U2, deep in South America selling out stadiums to artists in the Eastern Asia selling out. So I just think it's continuation of a artists global unlocked fan base and a global growth on an international basis, we'll see for years to come as artists continue now to look not just to the U.S., but to the entire globe to monetize their tour.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Okay. And this is slightly delicate question. With some of the terrible events that have been happening, what does this do to your potential liability or cost of insurance? How are you thinking about managing it?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. The reality of our business over years is that there has been incidents like this. In the big picture of global number of shows that happen every day, it's still 1% of the business, if you want to look in terms of scale. So, I think, we're continually – whether it was Manchester or certain event over time, the industry in general has gotten better and better at whether it's onsite security. You see it in arenas, you see it in stadiums. I think the industry in general has been doing a better job over the last five years of upgrading its onsite. For us, as horrible as Vegas was, the business is very resilient. We're seeing increased ticket sales since September. We've seen no effect at all on the business from the day on – the day after. Again, because we are a global business, we have such diversity that on a global basis, we didn't see any effect. Now, we're going to continue to make sure we're the best in terms of security onsite, something we always are investing in. We think the digital ticket is an important piece because we think it's going to become more and more important that we know exactly who was at that show and that we have a means to talk to them. So, if the bar code goes away and we have a digital ticket, we have a much better chance to figure out who was going to the show, have a faster response time. So, we think technology will help a lot of ways bring even more high sophisticated ways to secure and bring safety to the events. We don't assume that we're going to see any change in the consumer or artist perspective on the show to-date, and we'll keep investing in overall security. But we don't see any bottom-line change to our cost structure, insurance or revenue in terms of demand at this point.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to David Joyce with Evercore.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. A couple of questions emanating from the NFL deal. First on Presence as an upgrade to the platform, what should we think about in terms of the roll outs until you get all digital on ticketing; first, in North America; and then, how far that can go internationally? And what's involved from an investment perspective to do that from here? And then, secondly, with this new – the agreement with NFL, seems like you have the ability to share data on the end user. Is that something that could be applicable to other platforms that might tap into your API, like an Amazon that you (32:43) have some sort of a mutually beneficial deal? Thank you.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. As far as Presence, just Ticketmaster already is in the access control business. If you go to a Ticketmaster building today with your ticket, you're going to walk up and someone's going to scan it and that bar code and that's going to hook up to our back system. That currently is our system, we would be supplying those venues with those scanners and hardware, et cetera. The new Presence system is much cheaper hardware overall for us to implement. So as we're updating venues and providing them with scanning systems, we'll be changing that access control into our new Presence model, which is overall cheaper for us on a fixed cost basis. Obviously, when we announced the NFL going to be digital by 2019 on stadiums in the U.S., that gives you a pretty good indication that we're ready for primetime. We'll be rolling it out next year into 2018 and 2019 across all major stadiums and arenas that are Ticketmaster driven. So, we're ready for a fairly aggressive rollout across America and we think, yes, there's a whole bunch of good benefits around this, gives the artist and the sports team much more control of the ticket. It controls how they want to price that ticket and how that ticket ultimately is used on site. Gives us great data about those four people that went to the show versus the one that bought it, gives us a way to engage with that customer on site and ongoing. So, we think that the data that Presence on the digital ticket unlocks really now starts converting our business from – to-date, we're in the delivery of bar codes. Presence lets us get in the delivery of looking at each fan as a data point in itself. And with that combined in rich data we think it helps our business immensely, drives our sponsorship business to new levels when we can really have the next level of depth around who was at these events and who they brought and have a correspondence engagement with them. So, we think it's the foundation to a big piece of our future on unlocking all of those customers and we think we have a bunch of different ways and products in the road pipe – in the pipe on how we'll monetize that data.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research Partners.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Couple of things. Joe, I'm trying to reconcile your guidance on tickets for the year, and the show count is pretty consistent with what you've said in the past with your comment that the percentage AOI in the fourth quarter should be a little lower than a year ago. Now, I realize you've had some big quarters here year-to-date. So, is there anything unusual about the mix of shows in the fourth quarter or is it a function of the fact that you have had such a big year so far to-date? And then I've got a follow up.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think it's more a function of the tremendous year we've had so far, and in particular just the great set of stadium shows, in particular, that tend to be our largest shows. So over the summer months, I think that's been a big spike, as we've talked about, really driving a lot of the attendance growth. I don't think we see Q4 as being particularly different from traditional Q4s in terms of our content.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then a question for Kathy. You mentioned an $18 million swing in acquisition expenses. Was that a reversal of prior – I mean, I'm trying to get a handle on what that is, because it looks like it was a fairly significant contributor to your AOI calculation, if I looked at it correctly?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Well, correct. So what that is, is just the cost of earn-outs that we do on acquisitions where we have contingent consideration payments later. And so, those calculations will adjust based on how those businesses are doing and projections of the future business.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: So, in terms of some of the cost of services in the segments that would be reflected above, and then you sort of reconcile it below, is that fair?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Correct. When you're looking at the operating income for the segments, it goes into the SG&A costs and then it comes out in the AOI calc (37:27).
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Ryan Sundby with William Blair.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey, Ryan.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Just want to follow-up on Verified Fan. So it sounds like you're targeting about 3 million fans this year. Where can Verified Fan ultimately go over time? And what does that ramp look like? Is there still a lot of education process that needs to go on or are artists more and more willing to kind of signup for that process?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Again, we think Verified Fan just incredible runway ahead of it for Ticketmaster. I mean, we've been working hard with Ticketmaster the last few years on some core products. Obviously, we've talked well about our new platform for the venues, which is working well. We've talked about opening up the platform to give clients and ourselves flexibility. Obviously, the other piece we've talked about on addressing is how do we make sure we really understand this whole $8 billion of dynamic, dollars and how does content better capture it. Well, to capture that dollars, there is a few angles. There is no one – not one shot at it. The first is, how do you price the show better and that's just a function of how willing the artist is to dynamically price it, but artists are more and more willing to look at a lot of our algorithms and pricing dynamic tools to price the house and capture some of it. So that's the best angle is work with the artist on day one on pricing. The second piece is, once you kind of figure out how to price the house better from the top to lower prices in the back, is then with the artist how do you make sure now if that artist has committed to those price points, can you give that artist the opportunity to actually deliver those price points to the fan. That was the piece that was missing when we sat down with fans – with artist. There is no artist that's dying to put tickets on a secondary platform as a solution. That isn't how they build their brands with their fans. What they want to do is figure out how to price it right and then make sure their fans actually have a shot to buy the ticket, not deliver it to the on-sale, have the scalper buy it, and their fan in Boston ends up paying 3 times the price. We believe for Ticketmaster to really turn around its kind of business with the artist and really be artist-centric, Verified Fan was a core product development. So, if you look in this last year, to be sitting here this far with Taylor Swift, and Bruce Springsteen on Broadway to just announce yesterday U2 doing its entire U.S. tour on a Fan Verified, the list is just now growing by the day. I mean, we have yet to meet an artist when we sit down with them and say, are you interested in making sure your fan can get your ticket at the price you set? I mean, where do I sign-up is the answer, of course. So we think we really pulled a really strategic kind of zig versus zag in the marketplace here. While everyone was obsessed with secondary business, our clients are actually obsessed with pricing the house better and then locking down that price point. We think Fan Verified and then you add on presence from the digital perspective are a real important combination for these artists of the future, who now believe they have some shot at controlling and delivering to their fans the price point at the exact price they want. And so, we think this is a pivotal product – suite of products that we've developed in Ticketmaster. It's under a new division within Ticketmaster called Artist Master where we have a new leadership team waking up every day, making sure that we can deliver artist products, so the artists can deliver their tickets to their fans at better pricing and at the price they want. So, we think it's a unique proposition and lots of runway ahead, and a real pivotal positioning for Ticketmaster to really look at the artist and deliver their needs. And ultimately, that's great for their business as no one else is really able right now to deliver that ticket at their price.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And it seems like the artist buy-in is definitely there. Is that maybe somewhat restrictive in terms of educating the consumer about Verified Fan and how to use it? Is that where it maybe go slower than, I guess, going forward, until that education process happens?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. No, we haven't seen that at all. I mean I think our – when you sit down with U2s and Taylor Swifts of the world, I think they're the best brand managers in the world, right. So, they are very, very astute on what is the price, not what's the most they can charge. That's not how they built these global brands. It's what's the price that makes sense for the production and the cost of the show and fair to the fan and how do I make sure that my fan has a shot to buy that ticket. The system is not perfect yet, but I'd say this was a real monumental movement where the artist has absolutely control in implementing this tool and some of the cost of delivering a ticket directly to a fan could come at the expense of transferability. But I think that the artist at times is willing to make that trade-off in terms of delivering that ticket direct to the fan. And to-date, we've had great success at that. The only complaints we've seen is from the scalper, not the fan.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: That's great to hear. And then, I guess, just if you could reflect back on the decision to kind of open up the API. You got 10 million ticket so far through kind of off-platform, how would you – I guess where did you see that when you made that decision that it's growing ahead of expectations or about where it should be? Just any color there would be great.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, I think we should be – we're very proud and we're bragging on the NFL deal. I mean, Joe and I, and Jared, who run Ticketmaster, can be judged on that NFL deal. When we took over Ticketmaster, if we had stayed the exact course, that NFL deal wasn't getting renewed, because the market has changed over the years, and Ticketmaster had a very close platform for many years and, as we say, was in the no business. And our competitors knew it, and SeatGeeks and others, that was their primary strategy, to talk to content about being open. So we knew years – a few years ago, it was fundamental that if we were in the software business for concerts and ticketing and venues and sports, we had to provide them with more flexibility. And we're thrilled that the software and the platform delivered as we wanted and we've been able to sit down this last year and deliver a big renewal like the NFL and a bunch of renewals this year that are all hinged on our ability to look at a venue and a sports team and give them flexibilities that they may need to distribute some tickets to different partners to drive their business. We didn't want to be in the – you can't, on Tuesday, when you have no – you have a bunch of tickets left over and you need to distribute them to Groupon or whoever it is, that we couldn't enable that. So, we think that the test of is our strategy working isn't even the 10 million tickets. It's how has the renewal rate at Ticketmaster excelled over the last couple of years, as we've fixed and now fixed our software from green screen to now actually starting to deliver leading-edge technology from open source to Verified Fan, and we see it in the renewal rates on our core business is the net output of the better product.
Ryan Ingemar Sundby - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. That's great color. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. Live Nation continued growing its business in the second quarter with revenue up 31% and AOI up 23% at constant currency and free cash flow up 42%. All three segments grew as we continued demonstrating the strength of our business model. Our concerts business is our flywheel, through July selling over 68 million tickets to shows this year, 12 million more tickets than at this point last year. This demonstrates that we have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, bringing over 550 million fans in 40 countries to live events each year. With key metrics in these concerts, sponsorship, and ticketing pacing double-digits ahead of last year, we are confident that 2017 will be another record year of results for Live Nation. Starting with the concerts business; in the second quarter, we promoted over 7,000 shows for 24 million fans, an increase of 5.5 million fans from Q2 last year. As a result, for the quarter, we grew revenue by 36% and AOI by 52% both at constant currency. We extended our position as the leading promoter in the world as we delivered growth across all markets and venue types. We increased attendance in North America and international by 2 million fans each; and arenas, amphitheaters, stadiums, festivals, and theaters increased attendance by double-digits. As we attract more fans to concerts, we continue to focus on maximizing the revenue and profitability of each show. This starts with attracting more fans to each show and, during the quarter, we increased our average show attendance by 11%, with every venue type delivering higher attendance per show. Additionally, our food and beverage initiative at our amphitheaters continued to improve the onsite experience, driving increased spend per fan with programs ranging from increasing the number of points-of-sale to improved product offering to optimize pricing. As a result, we continue to expect to increase ancillary spend by approximately $2 per fan again this summer. Given the strong performance of our shows to-date and the pipeline of shows for the rest of the year, I expect us to grow our fan base to 80 million this year. And this, with additional fans, I'm confident that we will deliver strong growth in our concerts results, providing the flywheel to grow our sponsorship and ticketing business. In the sponsorships and advertising business, we again delivered strong growth this quarter with revenue up 32% and AOI up 23% at constant currency. Live Nation's ongoing success in growing its high margin sponsorship and advertising business is based on its unique scale and breadth in the live experience space. No other advertising platform can match our 80 million onsite engaged fans, over 550 million direct connections with fans attending events each year, and over 2 billion touch points across our digital reach. From festivals to branded content to exclusive access to tickets and events, the combined Live Nation Concerts and Ticketmaster platforms deliver an audience unmatched in music. Our growth continues to be strongly driven by our strategic brand relationships, with over 50 sponsors that each spend more than $1 million with us each year across our onsite and online platforms to reach that highly-sought-after Millennial customer. This group accounts for over 75% of our total sponsorship and, through the second quarter, their committed spend has grown by 25% to over $250 million. Festival sponsorship continues to provide the most attractive onsite platform. In the second quarter, we grew this category by 32% year-on-year. And for the full year, we are tracking toward mid-teens growth across our 95 festivals with over 8 million fans. Based on this strong start to the year, and now with over 90% of our planned sponsorship for the year under contract, I expect double-digit AOI growth in the low-teens for the business this year. Ticketmaster continues to demonstrate that it is the best marketplace for venues, teams, and artists to sell tickets to fans globally, with GTV growth on fee-bearing tickets up 8% for the quarter, at constant currency. Year-to-date, fee-bearing GTV is up 13%, and the past three quarters have been the highest transacted GTV quarters in the company's history. As a result, Ticketmaster's revenue for the quarter was up 11% and AOI up 2% at constant currency. Year-to-date, revenue was up 16% and AOI up 13% at constant currency, with quarterly timing impacted by the shift in concert on-sales as we discussed last quarter. Our success at Ticketmaster starts with providing fans with the best solutions to their ticketing needs. Building on our integration of primary and secondary tickets, we have now expanded our listings to also include secondary tickets to shows for which Ticketmaster is not the primary ticketing, all purchased in the same checkout flow. This has now increased the number of events we have listed by 35%, further leveraging the 120 million fans visiting our online sites per month. And as we expand our inventory, we continued improving the customer purchase process, helping us increase conversion by high single-digits on desktop and double-digit on mobile sites. As we increase conversion on mobile sites, we continue to see a strong shift in purchase behavior to mobile, with these sites with our apps accounting for 31% of our sales in the quarter, up 27% year-on-year. Along with the focus on fan experience, we're providing venues, teams, and artists with the additional tools and services to more effectively price and distribute their tickets. One of the services we uniquely provide is the range of distribution partners that can sell incremental tickets for our clients. For the quarter, these off-platform sales are up 11% and year-to-date they are up 21% to almost 7 million tickets. On the new product roadmap, we're seeing great success with our Verified Fan product, which enables artists to prioritize the distribution of tickets to actual fans utilizing a proprietary Ticketmaster scoring algorithm of fan behavior. Since launching the product earlier this year, we have worked with 50 artists in the United States and Europe to sell over 1 million tickets to true fans with dramatic reduction in these tickets than being sold on secondary sites. Overall, our Ticketmaster results are validating our dual strategy of delivering a great marketplace for fans to buy tickets while providing a great software solution to venues, teams, and artists looking to maximize the value of their events. By continuing to do so effectively, I expect us to deliver high-single-digit growth in ticketing AOI this year. In summary, 2017 is on track to be another year of growth and record results for the company. All the key indicators for our business, concert tickets sold for shows this year, contracted sponsorships, fee-bearing ticketing GTVs are on pace double-digits ahead of last year. And as a result, we expect each of our businesses to deliver record revenue and AOI this year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details on divisional performance this quarter.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. Live Nation Concerts' revenue in the second quarter was up 36% and AOI was up 52% both at constant currency. Our revenue growth was driven by a 29% increase in attendance for the quarter and in that North America was up 25% while international growth was 36%. Arena attendance in the second quarter was up 36%, with over 6.5 million fans attending these shows. Amphitheater attendance was up 14%, as we saw higher than normal pacing of shows in the Q2 this year. And following very strong stadium attendance last year, this quarter attendance was up another 29% with 4.5 million fans attending over 100 shows globally. Looking forward to the second half, as Michael said, we've already sold over 68 million tickets for shows this year through July, an increase of 22%. Our pipeline of shows in the second half, particularly stadiums and arenas continues to be very strong and we expect to increase our show count to over 28,000 this year for 80 million fans. And from a timing standpoint, coming off this very strong Q2 activity, we expect the majority of remaining fan growth to come in Q4 this year. AOI growth was also driven by our artist management business, now within our concert segment, as it had very strong quarter with increased terrain and other activity. With this momentum across the board, we expect continued strong growth in our concerts AOI for the year. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. Our sponsorship business benefited from our concerts flywheel, helping drive revenue up 32% this quarter, while AOI was up 23% both at constant currency. The sponsorship part of our business was particularly strong this quarter, with revenue up 37%, while online revenue was up 16%, again at constant currency. Our festival business played a large part in this growth and we're succeeding and expanding our sponsorship at festivals, as we increased sponsorship per fan by 6% through the first half of the year. Our mix shift also impacted sponsorship margins for the quarter, but we expect most of this to be just timing within the overall year. With over $300 million in sponsorship and advertising net revenue now contracted for the year, we're confident we will deliver AOI growth in the low-teens for the full year. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 11% and AOI up 2% both at constant currency. Here too, we are seeing the impact of our concerts flywheel as Q1 revenue was up 22% and AOI up 26% from increased concert ticket sales. For the second quarter, as we indicated on the last earnings call, ticketing saw lower growth as the concerts played out. That said, primary ticketing fee-bearing GTV was up 9% globally in the quarter, driven by international growth of 27% Secondary ticketing was down 2% for the quarter, coming off a very tough comp from being up 50% for the second quarter last year. The reduction was driven by the sports side which saw a decline as we didn't have the same post-season activity levels as we have last year. Our secondary concerts business continued to grow in the quarter, even as we successfully deployed pricing initiatives in our Verified Fan product to shift money out of secondary and into primary. This gives us confidence our integrated marketplace continues to be working and results through July support this, indicating we will deliver double-digit growth in the secondary GTV for the quarter. Finally, while ticketing margins were off a bit in the quarter from lower growth, for the full year, we still expect flat year-on-year margins. So, given all this, we expect to deliver high single-digit AOI growth for the full year, with most of the remaining growth for the year coming in the fourth quarter's concerts for 2018 go on sale. And in summary, more than half way through the year, we're confident that 2017 will be another year of record top line and bottom line results overall and for each of our businesses. We also expect record free cash flow of AOI conversion into free cash flow at historical rates. From a timing perspective, we expect Q3 to be a similar percentage of full year activity as last year and FX is becoming less of an issue with overall Q2 revenue and AOI impact of about 1% and current forecast indicating that full year overall revenue and AOI impact will be negligible. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with our results for the second quarter, revenue was up 29% to $2.82 billion and AOI increased 22% to $221 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 31% to $2.86 billion and AOI was $223 million, an increase of 23%. As of June 30, our event related deferred revenue was $1.5 billion, up 31% from $1.2 billion last year. This level of deferred revenue is nearly double the amount we had in June of 2014 which is a great indication of how our flywheel has grown. Free cash flow for the quarter was $154 million, up 42% from 2016. Revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by concerts with an increase of 34% from higher show count and fan attendance in arenas and stadiums globally. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 31% from new sponsorship programs and growth in our online advertising business. And ticketing revenue was up 9% from higher primary volume, driven by concert ticket sales. AOI growth for the quarter was driven by a 51% increase in concerts AOI from higher show count and attendance in arenas as well as increased results in our amphitheater, theaters, and clubs. We also had AOI growth from higher management commissions as artists touring income was up. Sponsorship and advertising AOI increased 21% from strong growth in our sponsorship business and higher online advertising. Operating income in the second quarter was $113 million, a 53% increase over last year driven by growth in concerts and sponsorship AOI. Net income was $81 million, up from $38 million in the second quarter of last year. Interest expense for the quarter included $1 million of expense related to the refinancing of our $970 million term loan B facility. We reduced the interest rate from LIBOR plus 2.5% to LIBOR plus 2.25%, which we expect will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $2.4 million. Lastly, other income in the second quarter included net foreign exchange rate gains from revaluation of $4 million compared to 2016, which included a loss of $7 million. Moving to the results for the first half of the year. Revenue was up 25% to $4.23 billion and AOI increased 23% to $314 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 27% to $4.29 billion. Free cash flow for the first six months was $180 million, up 36%. All of our segments delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income, and AOI for the first six months. The majority of the revenue growth in the first half of the year was in the concert segment, largely from increased show count and attendance in arenas and stadiums. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 23% for the six months and ticketing revenue increased 15% from higher primary and resale volume of concerts tickets. AOI for the first six months was driven by our strong results across all three segments. Operating income was $92 million compared to $41 million last year, driven by the increase in AOI. And net income for the first-half of the year was $48 million compared to a loss of $7 million last year. For the six months, other income included net foreign exchange rate gains is $7 million compared to $1 million in 2016. For the full year, we currently estimate that the impact to earnings per share for the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest will be approximately $65 million. Moving to our balance sheet; as of June 30, we had total cash of $2.2 billion, including $704 million in ticketing client cash and $1 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $464 million. Cash flow from operations for the first six months was $804 million compared to $511 million in 2016, with the increase driven by our growth in AOI, higher deferred revenue, and the timing of the payment of liabilities. Our total capital expenditures were $116 million for the first six months, with 52% spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect total capital expenditures for 2017 to be approximately $220 million, with roughly half on revenue-generating CapEx. As of June 30, our total net debt was $2.3 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 3.9%. Thank you for joining us today and we will now open the call for questions, operator?
Operator: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. We first go to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. You mentioned a higher than normal phasing (19:24) of amphitheater shows in Q2, but also that you're seeing increased fans per show at all venues. With that in mind, any sense what we can expect for amp attendance for the rest of the year, and then any guidance you can give around festival attendance also?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. This is Joe. On the amp attendance, I think as we said last quarter, most of our – after we had a big growth in our amphitheater attendance last year, most of the growth that we were seeing across amphitheaters, arenas, and stadiums this year was coming on the arena and stadium front. So we expect our overall, for the amphitheaters, to be fairly in line with last year on our attendance, which again has been big growth over the past few years. But what then we saw within that was a timing shift where we had more of our amphitheater shows in Q2 of this year relative to last year. That said, as you indicated, and as we've talked about, we've got greater attendance per show across the board and so continue to see very strong demand. Overall, on the festival side, again continued growth in our festival attendance.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then, we saw the announcement in July that you had launched the Ticketmaster Presence API on a limited basis. It appears to be a pretty significant move towards digital ticketing. Can you talk a little bit about the product, potential applications and uses, including the ability for sports teams to substantially grow their fan database? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. So, Presence is a big step in digital ticketing which is that it allows for teams to have their tickets to be fully digital throughout, not use barcoded tickets. This then allows the teams to know every individual who's coming, so rather than the usual I buy four season tickets and you only know me or if I buy tickets and take friends, it allows you, because the digital ticket is transferred much like an airline ticket that you have on your phone or even if it's paper, it's a personalized ticket that we can then start to know who all the people are. That's critical as the teams and content in general is more and more focused on knowing who their fan base is, what's their activity, how do I market to them at the event, gives them all of the data that they need for that. So, this is the first – not the first, this is one of the critical steps of having the access control that can tie into that digital ticketing.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brandon Ross with BTIG.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. The NFL Exchange deal is up at the end of the year. I was wondering what your strategy with regard to the renewal of that deal is and how important primary and secondary relationships with the NFL teams and sports are more broadly? And then what – just one on the numbers for secondary, I think you said to expect the reacceleration from the Q2 growth number. Can you help us with where you expect to come in on secondary growth for the year? And if you still see this as a meaningful growth driver for you in the longer-term? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Brandon...
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Joe, I'll start and then I'll let you – I'll let you take the second part, Joe. Brandon, the NFL has been a long-term client and partner with Ticketmaster and we have two relationships you have to think about. We have a league relationship where we had an ongoing secondary partnership for the last 10 years with Ticketmaster NFL Exchange. And then we have 32 – 31 actually, out of the 32 local venue team relationships with Ticketmaster. NFL doesn't control the local teams. Jerry Jones gets to pick whoever he wants to use for ticketing in his venue and we've been very successful over the years having close relationships with the stadiums, because we have a great product and also especially even after year like 2017, where we're delivering massive tours and content to those stadiums in the off season. So, we tend to be very good partners with the NFL stadium owners and we expect those relationship and our renewal to continue there. On the NFL secondary negotiation, we're feeling good that we're going to continue to be partners with the NFL and driving some of their secondary business. For us, overall, Joe is going to jump in on the exact number, but I think primary is over 80% of the volume if you added the two together when you look at the local teams versus the secondary league deal. So, continued very important that we renewed team-by-team, venue-by-venue using our great software upgrade as well as our content which helps on the venue front. So, we expect continued being within business with the NFL owners and we'll continue on our negotiation with the league for our secondary business. And Joe will take the second piece of that question.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Brandon, as we said, when we looked at the second quarter, what we saw was, what we believe to be a market decline notably in sports, just because of comp year-on-year activity around some of the play-offs, some of the teams involved and some of the other big events, but concerts continue to grow in the second quarter, and as we are now almost half way into Q3 looking at the secondary performance, what we see is there's continued strong growth in the concert side in particular. And that is giving us confidence that we will return to double-digit growth in the secondary GTV in the third quarter.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Thanks very much, guys.
Operator: Next question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies.
Jaime Sue Morris - Jefferies LLC: Hi. It's Jaime Morris for John. There were a couple of high profile issues with festivals last quarter, Fyre and Pemberton. The outcomes probably suggest they're a little more complicated than some people think in order to be successful. Can you talk about, to what extent, you see any benefit or fallout for Live Nation and have you seen any impact, more broadly, on your attendance from this part of your business?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: It's Michael. We've seen no attendance affect at all. In the broad picture, we have over 95 festivals, globally. The business has been very strong on a global basis. Festivals continue to be a very strong high margin business for us. We see continued growth in festivals on a global basis, some cities have more festivals than others, but on global basis, there is tons of opportunity to keep growing whether it's country, EDM, indie, pop, et cetera. So we think huge opportunity in festivals continually for long time. We saw no consumer effect by the two festivals that went down. I mean, you are right, we do like highlighting those to the agents' managers of the world that there is a big difference when you work with Live Nation on the quality of the product, the guaranteed cash flow to the artist, the levels of a festival we're going to produce versus a rich kid with a plot of land wants to be a festival producer for the week. You're going to run into a few of those Pembertons and others that go down. But those are really, in the big picture, percent of nothing on an overall fan, nor artist, nor agent kind of effect. But overall, we continue to see. If you're well financed and you have the infrastructure, festivals can continue to be high margin. Good business, if you're in the one-off business with no scale or you have one or two of them, tough business to be in without scale.
Jaime Sue Morris - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much. Just one other, you've made some acquisitions on the ticketing side of the business over the past couple of years, can you give us an update on the integration or the rebranding to Ticketmaster and how they are performing relative to plan?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. This is Joe. I'm happy to. So, you're right, we've acquired a handful – a lot of what we've acquired, frankly, has not been necessarily to integrated it into Ticketmaster as a master brand. As we've talked on the call and elsewhere before, when we acquired Ticketmaster in 2010, it had followed a master brand, everything through one point strategy. In our view, as of in today's world, you had different needs of different segments and you have to super serve each of those segments. So whether that segment is our festival segment that needs to have camping and do-it-yourself, whether it's your club and theater segment, whether it's your do-it-yourself segment, remember the acquisitions we made have been to target each of those verticals and grow those businesses. And as we've talked in over a variety of calls, those businesses continue to grow and perform well as we add new customers and as we bring them into the Live Nation fold and then they provide services for Live Nation which has, obviously, been growing across all of our different venue-types globally. So those are working well. The other handful of acquisitions we've made have been more on the acqui-hire front, continuing to build our technology capability, helping us accelerate a number of things we've been doing that we've talked about such as the Presence, the Verified Fan, and a range of other programs that we've been able to launch much more rapidly in recent times than ever could have historically.
Jaime Sue Morris - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks and good afternoon. So, two questions. I guess, Joe, following up on the ticketing side, can you remind us the margin mix between or the margin differential between international ticketing and North America, and should we expect that the majority of growth on a primary side is going to come from the international segments going forward? And my second questions is, Live Nation signed a pretty high profile deal with Samsung today. Wondering how much or how big you think this market could be? You have a couple of VR deals now. And obviously, it could lead to pretty big numbers. Can you help us think through how you're monetizing this, either through advertising or maybe a rev share? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. I'll take the first one. On the ticketing margin, so, generally speaking, international margins in ticketing are lower than North America margins, be it the service fees are lower, and so there's fewer dollars through the system and, ultimately, a lower margin. I wouldn't say that most of our growth is going to be coming from international though. The growth in ticketing, to a pretty good extent, follows a lot of our growth on the concert side and we've talked many times just at how much as we continue to get hyper local and continue to breakdown the pieces and go into every market that North America has continued to unlock a lot of growth over recent years and we expect that to continue as we continue our obsession on that hyper local that we've been pursuing. So, I wouldn't necessarily say it's going to be international. I think, this quarter, for all the reasons that we've talked about in terms of timing of concert on-sales and so on, you just have a bit lower growth and when you have lower growth, that's probably going to be, relatively speaking, lower margin as you look at the overall numbers. But, as Michael said and as we've indicated in the past, we think this year it will probably be right about in line on margins and ticketing for the full year as it was last year.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Amy, I'll jump in on the second question. We're very proud of this new focus over the last, I guess, two years called our Live Nation Studios, whether it's the documentary of Puff that we had on Apple TV, a documentary on Eagles of Death on HBO. We're going to continue to look for ways to amplify our live events, through documentaries, through streaming live – Zac Brown on Twitter, or Coldplay with Samsung in virtual reality. So, we think – there's two main reasons we're doing this. The first is always the more we amplify the event, the better we know it becomes in marketing – so, getting Zac Brown on Twitter, lots of the Facebook stuff live we've been doing, festivals. We know that if you can't make it to the event or there's 100 dates in this tour and you're looking at the first five or six online, we know that's a great way to drive conversion and purchase. So, obviously, live video, any version of that, getting to fans to either pre-sell future tours or get them really excited about next year's Lollapalooza, we think it's the way you need now to market your product. And then the second is, it's all around our sponsorship, Samsung and all of our other high margin sponsors. In order to service 900 sponsors, we always say, our proposition is about onsite to online. So, we've got to figure out ways to continually excite our customers and sponsors about not only the 80 million customers that we touch directly, but that we have ways to reach them outside of the venue and amplify that. And virtual reality in itself, we think, is an exciting tool for sponsors and artists. I don't know, Amy, at what point in time that on its own is a monetizable business, I don't know if people are going to charge to see Drake from their living room in a virtual reality setting. But as the leaders in the business, we want to stay ahead of it and continue to be the leaders in innovating around that. And, for now, we're more than thrilled to monetize it through Samsung and our advertising business and incremental ticket sales.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs.
Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question about ticketing growth in the quarter, maybe you could – sorry if this is kind of rudimentary, but could you just elaborate on – you had constant currency revenue growth of 11% in the quarter, but it only translated into 2% growth in AOI. Can you just describe sort of the dynamics that cause that to happen? And I certainly appreciate, maybe it's timing, the half year numbers look pretty good. But I just want to better understand the dynamics that drive that sort of discrepancy.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, it absolutely is, there is a chunk of it that is revenue recognition and just timing within quarters. So we talked a lot about the fact that we, in the first quarter, sold a tremendous number of arena stadium tickets which really drove up our level of recognized activity. Our amphitheater tickets which don't get recognized in Q1 then flow into Q2. So, there's just some math around the revenue recognition, expense recognition that's going to impact it. And then secondly, as we just grow the business and we add more verticals and we add more markets and we add more everything, your fixed cost is going to grow. Right? So, your fixed cost is going to grow, and then I think that what you see is, over the course of the year you kind of even out that fixed cost on a pretty stable basis against fluctuations in your revenue. So, I just think you have to look at it on a longer-term basis in the quarter, and we don't try to obsess over what we're managing the numbers for the quarter.
Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. I guess – second question, you mentioned that you're pacing to add another $2 per fan on the sort of per cap spending. Could you help me understand, like, how the attendance at your owned and operated venues how that's sort of pacing, like, what sort of the absolute number you're looking for this year and maybe what's the kind of the growth rate pacing?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. As I've said, I think on the earlier message, our pacing in total for the year on amphitheaters is pretty much in line with last year, in terms of our total attendance. And again this is just the year-to-year. Last year, it was our amps that drove a lot of our fan growth and this year it's arenas and stadiums that are growing lot of our fan growth. So, no different than some of the quarterly fluctuations you see. You see some difference in terms of just where the growth is coming from on it. So, we're seeing though strong per cap growth against that, and again the per cap growth is coming as we continue to add more points-of-sale, focus on optimizing pricing, product selection, a whole range of initiatives that we have on the amphitheaters to continue to provide a greater experience, better service for our fans, generally translates into them spending more.
Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Doug Arthur with Huber Research.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Joe, I thought you, if I heard you correctly, threw out a reference to Artist Nation having a strong quarter. Last year, I think when you were still breaking Artist Nation out, did about $87 million in revenues. Is it fair to conclude, if I heard you correctly, that it was up double-digit this quarter. I'm just trying to (38:04) back out for kind of the true concert number.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, it is all concert number. It is – but, yeah, I think, it's fair to assume it is up double-digits and that we mentioned it because as we think about the overall growth of the concert business in Q2, that was a material component of it.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then, I mean, you had kind of suggested earlier in the year that timing was going to help the second quarter. But your – but it doesn't seem to be distracting at all from your big seasonal third quarter. I would assume that the mix of shows, obviously, given the summer amp and heavier festivals, will be different in terms of less impact from arena and stadium shows overall in the third quarter. So that may change some of the metrics in terms of attendance per event, et cetera. Is that a fair way to look at it?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, I think, what we said is, certainly not going to, we don't believe, detract from Q3. We said that we think that the majority of the remaining fan growth was coming in more Q4, so Q3 expected to be, in aggregate, kind of in line with last year in terms of the overall AOI as the portion of the year. So continue to show some growth overall, but again the majority of the fan growth now in Q4, in part because you have that shift of amp attendance from Q3 into Q2 that's then has, obviously, been fully made up for by arena and stadium activity in Q3.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So, maybe more detail than you want to try to model, but to give you the flavor.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: I'll get there somehow. Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from Kyle Evans with Stephens.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Your release alludes to expanding listings to include secondary tickets there that were not primarily sold by Ticketmaster. Could you help us think about how that might change the long-term competitive dynamic that you've got with StubHub and help us think about how that affects ticketing just longer-term? Thank you.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I think – I'll give you the strategy not so much the guidance, obviously, there were some key strategies. When we took over Ticketmaster, we had some fundamentals that we wanted to change from a historic closed platform, and those three strategies that we're bringing to life. The first strategy was to truly enter the secondary business, we weren't in it, enter it and stock it on the shelves at ticketmaster.com, so fans could solve their problem at 10:01 (40:56) and that's been working well. Second was to build an API so we could start talking to the world, both outside and in. So to make the actual secondary business work, we needed to develop the API so you could list your product at our site. And now we talk a lot about distributed commerce and how we can link up to Spotify and Bandsintown, and other places where we can sell incremental tickets. And the third strategy was always about what that API is let the outside world post to Ticketmaster, get more inventory on the shelf whether you're a Ticketmaster customer or not. And again fundamentally, at Ticketmaster, when we started to reshape Ticketmaster, we really broke the business in two places. One was about the marketplace and what's right for the customer, and then, separate, what's the software that's servicing the client in the venue. And we've been rebuilding both of those with separate teams, so if you ran my marketplace, your number one objective would be to solve the customers' problem. They need a Justin Timberlake ticket at the STAPLES Center, it might not be the Ticketmaster venue, but we want to sell you that ticket, obviously because the more problems we can solve at our site, the better our traffic, our conversion remain. So with over 100 million unique users a month coming to our site looking for tickets, we now are able to list a substantial more amount of events and tickets and every time we now sell or convert one of those, that's incremental business to us. And we're at the beginning stages of that. We have – Joe can maybe jump in on some of the numbers in terms of the percentage of the shows or tickets that will be going up this year, but substantial increase in our inventory and continues to make tm.com a leading [technical difficulty] (42:46 – 42:58).
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Operator? Sorry, guys. Michael's line had a little problem there. So, as Michael was saying, this – by doing this, we got about a 35% increase in terms of number of shows that we're able to list. So that, to us, continues to both have a platform to attract more fans and also leverage the 120 million fans... (43:21 – 43:35)
Unknown Speaker: Thank you. I notice that Amazon keeps hiring people in the music business, particularly on the international side. So, far they've only put on a couple of sort of sponsor-type shows, but how do you see that presence emerging?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. I don't know.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Over to you, Joe.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think that they've obviously, there has been a lot of discussion, a lot probably in the press about what they're doing. We've seen the activity that everybody else has in the U.K. with testing some different things and we continue to be very consistent and simple in our view that our job is to sell every possible ticket. Michael talked about the continued growth of our open platform, selling nearly 7 million tickets in the first half alone. And we will, absolutely, work with anybody that we believe can sell incremental tickets for our concerts or for our sporting clients or others. So, we haven't announced anything. So, we're not there in terms of having any arrangements, but we continue to look for all ways that we can sell those incremental tickets.
Unknown Speaker: Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from David Joyce with Evercore ISI.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some more color on where the sponsorship growth was coming from, are these some tack-ons to current contracts that are either adding some new regions or are these more regional sponsors that are coming on to these events? Are you getting more strategic deals? What the makeup of the growth that you're seeing?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. So, we talked about two main areas that are really driving the growth. The first is festivals, as we continue to add more festivals, but also more categories within our festivals, so we're driving rapid double-digit growth overall in our festivals, but also growing our festival – sorry – our per fan sponsorship at festivals. So it's a combination of including that – just continuing to grow the number of major festivals we have, but also more sponsors, more clients, more categories at those festivals. And then secondly is our strategic phase, which, we said, we continue to add a few customers, but really they're more than anything driving just a lot more spend. They're spending up 25% as we add a few more of them, so the big relationships that we have are continuing to see the effectiveness of our platform and looking for additional ways to use the myriad of our assets to reach their potential customers.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. And then if I could ask a second question on the M&A front, you sometimes have some deals that kind of fly beneath the radar, but have you been doing anything in the regions you've talked about in the past where you had interest like Latin America, was there anything that's been going on, on the M&A front?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. I mean nothing that of substance. Sometimes we do a small bolt-on promoter or a small venue or acquisition in our current markets. But no, nothing of substance we've acquired in this year, continuing to look at Latin America and Europe and Asia. And we look at 100 major cities where live entertainment is growing and dynamic and we have lots of room to expand either ticketing concerts or festivals in those markets. So we think we have lots of runway for acquisitions that's accretive and will grow the flywheel. We're just patiently continuing to look for them around the globe.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. With no further questions in queue, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: All right. Thank you.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter's conference call. Live Nation has continued growing its business in 2017, with first quarter revenue up 17% and AOI up 25%, with strong operating performance across all our concert, advertising and ticketing segments. This year, we have booked more shows, sold more tickets and have more sponsorship commitments than ever before at this point of the year. With the strength of these leading indicators, I'm confident we will once again deliver record top line and AOI performance in each of our businesses in 2017. The global concert industry is structurally growing, with strong tailwinds for both supply and demand. On the supply side, artists are touring now more than ever as live as their primary source of income. And on the demand side, between the millennial shifting of spend to experiences and the globalization of artists on social media, we see continued long-term growth as fans attending more concerts. And as of May 1, we are seeing this trend in our results, as we have booked over 4,000 arenas, stadium and amphitheater shows for 2017, up 10% over last year. This growth has led to arena and stadium shows up 18% and 32% respectively. And as a result, tickets sold through April for our concerts this year are up 25% to 46 million tickets. Along with the strong show and ticket count increase, we expect to continue driving the profitability of our concert business through increased on-site spending. This year we have invested to add more points of sale and continuing to refine our product assortment and pricing to drive fan satisfaction and sales. As more of our venues and festivals become Wi-Fi connected, we are seeing increased per fan spend through services such as seat order delivery, and we continue to scale up this summer with this service. Looking globally at the concert business, we now promote shows in 40 countries, as we continued reaching more fans in more markets. Our promotion business in Germany has been particularly successful. Having launched Live Nation Germany just one year ago, we now expect Germany to be our Number 2 market in Europe in 2017, with 1.5 million fans attending our shows. With all parts of our global concert business looking strong this year, the concert segment continues to be the engine that powers the Live Nation flywheel strategy, growing the profitability of the concert business, while also driving our advertising and ticketing business. In our advertising and sponsorship division, we continue to see strong brand demand for our 70 million-plus on-site audience, driving double-digit growth in our advertising business. As of May 1, we have commitments for over 80% of our planned advertising inventory for the year, pacing double-digits ahead of last year. We expect double-digit growth in festival sponsorship this year. And with over 80 festivals, it remains a top channel for brands to engage with their customers. And on our top client brands that spend over $1 million in advertising, we continue to see their increased spend, which now accounts for 75% of our total spend, and we see pacing in double-digits through April. We're also seeing increased demand for concert video content. In addition to announcing Twitter as our latest partner in streaming live concerts, we have captured four concerts in VR in partnerships with Hulu and NextVR, and last week we premiered the Live Nation-produced Puff Daddy documentary, Can't Stop, Won't Stop; The Bad Boy Story at the Tribeca Film Festival, and now being distributed by Apple. Collectively, this content provides us with an array of additional ad units and provides valuable marketing for our tours. Taking this all together, I expect us to again deliver double-digit AOI growth in our advertising business. In our first quarter, Ticketmaster delivered its largest quarter in history for GTV and ticket volume on a transacted basis. Our growth in this quarter came from both fee-bearing primary and secondary business, with GTV up 18% and 20% respectively. Our success starts with continuing to build our venue client base. In the first quarter, we added 245 new clients, providing them with the most effective software platform for their ticketing needs. On the commerce side, we began by attracting more fans to our sites, and in this quarter, we increased online business by 10% year-over-year and grew app installed base by 41% to 33 million. And once these fans come to our site or app, our investments to-date to improve the experience and purchase flow are driving higher conversion rates and increased sales for us. Other major initiatives we launched this past quarter is a new product called Fan Verified (sic) [Verified Fan], which leverages proprietary data and analytics to screen and verify potential ticket buyers, so we increase the likelihood that real fans will purchase tickets to artists' shows. We've now supported over 30 tours including Depeche Mode, Twenty One Pilots and Harry Styles, as they seek new ways to help get the tickets in the hands of real fans. This program has been highly successful in reducing by over 90% the number of tickets that have been sold on the resale market. With this strong start to the year, we expect another record year in ticketing. And overall, we see 2017 on track to deliver another year of record growth. All of the leading indicators for our concert, sponsorship and advertising business are ahead of last year and we expect our business to deliver record results. With that, I will turn it over to Joe.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at the business segments, first concerts, revenue grew 16% in the first quarter at constant currency, while AOI was down. This revenue increase was driven by growth in fans attending our shows up 22% to 10.9 million, with higher arena and stadium show count both in North America and internationally. AOI was down in part due to our higher cost structure for our concerts business, as we've scaled up our promotions and on-site product teams. We expect to benefit from this investment and the increased activity that will play out in the second and third quarters. To that point, as Michael said, we've already booked over 4,000 amphitheater, arena and stadium shows this year, up 10% from this point last year. And once again, we're promoting the vast majority of the top global tours, led by six tours, each already selling over 1 million tickets so far this year, including Coldplay, U2, Bruno Mars, Depeche Mode, Guns N' Roses and Metallica. We're also continuing to build our global festival portfolio, and this year we expect to hold 96 festivals, increasing our attendance to over 8 million fans. Our international markets continue to have a very strong lineup, and we expect to have 9,000 shows with more than 25 million fans in 2017, continuing to demonstrate the power of promoting artists in 40 countries around the world. From a timing standpoint, part of our ticket sales to-date are driven by the typically earlier on-sale timing for arena and stadium shows. For the full-year, we expect to deliver mid-single digit growth in both show count and attendance. Q2 looks to be particularly strong for both show count and attendance this year, thanks to these arena and stadium shows and some timing of our major festivals. And overall, we're delighted thus far with 2017 continuing to grow our concerts flywheel this year. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business, revenue grew by 13% and AOI grew by 10% for the first quarter, both at constant currency. Over 85% of our advertising AOI is typically recognized in the second through fourth quarters, so it's our committed sales pipeline that is our key leading indicator for the business at this point, and as Michael noted, 80% of our business expected for the year is already contracted and we're tracking double-digit ahead of this time last year. Finally, Ticketmaster, for the quarter, revenue was up 23% and AOI was up 25%, both at constant currency. Fee-bearing GTV was up 18% to $3.7 billion globally at constant currency and our primary fee-bearing GTV was also up 18% at constant currency, as we increased ticket sales by 11% and pricing was up 6% on average. Both North America and international markets grew ticket volume similarly, with North America up 10% and international up 11%. Not surprisingly, given our comments on a strong quarter for concert sales, our concerts segment drove approximately 60% of the ticket volume growth and 70% of the primary GTV growth for the quarter. In secondary, we grew our GTV 20% for the quarter at constant currency, our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Here two concerts were the primary growth driver accounting for 70% of the increased GTV. Michael pointed to the continued success Ticketmaster is having in attracting more fans to our sites and converting these visits to sales. And one additional point I want to make is on the continued growth of our mobile platform, as we further improve our mobile online experience in apps and we're increasing our traffic, app installs and conversion. And as a result, mobile ticket sales increased 39% year-over-year for the quarter, and overall mobile sales now represents 30% of our global ticket sales. Looking at the full year for ticketing, we expect the first quarter will be our best in terms of year-on-year comparisons, given the volume of concerts we put on sale. Between this strong first quarter and continued success attracting and converting buyers in both primary and secondary ticketing, we expect to deliver a mid- to high-single digit AOI growth for the year. And in summary, four months into the year, given the strength of all our leading indicators, we're confident that we will deliver record results in 2017. Our flywheel business model is working. Our first quarter results were driven by our ticketing business, notably from selling more tickets to more concerts. And in Q2 and Q3, we will see these concerts play-out, driving our high-margin, on-site and advertising businesses. On to few specifics, looking at seasonality, we expect Q2 to be a strong concerts quarter as I noted, and so AOI at a bit higher percentage of our full-year AOI than last year. And on FX, we saw a 1% to 2% impact on the business in Q1. And based on rates today, expect Q2 to be about the same. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe and good afternoon everyone. As I mentioned last time, we are now reporting three business segments starting this quarter; concerts, sponsorship & advertising, and ticketing. We have combined our previously reported Artist Nation segment into concerts, based on our view that the strategy behind artist management is to provide a full range of services related to concert promotion and to expand our concert businesses. We have also slightly changed our definition of free cash flow this quarter, now titled free cash flow adjusted, in order to reduce confusion with other similar measures and to recognize it as a liquidity measure tied back to cash flow from operating activity. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2017 are revenue was up 19% to $1.43 billion, and AOI increased 25% to $92 million, both at constant currency. Free cash flow adjusted was $27 million. Free cash flow would have been $29 million under our prior calculation, so the difference is not significant. As of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.6 billion, up 34% compared to $1.2 billion last year. Growth in concerts and ticketing drove the revenue increase for the quarter. Concerts revenue was up 16% from higher show counts at stadiums and arenas, and ticketing revenue was up 23% from the increased primary ticket volumes in GTV, driven by concert events, as Joe outlined, all at constant currency. AOI for the quarter was up 25%, driven by strong growth at Ticketmaster, with ticketing AOI also up 25% for the quarter, and sponsorship & advertising AOI was up 10% from the increased online advertising, all at constant currency. Operating loss in the first quarter was $21 million, an improvement of 36% from the same period last year, and net loss was $33 million compared to a loss of $45 million in the first quarter of 2016, driven by the higher AOI. Moving to our key balance sheet items, as of March 31, we had total cash of $2.2 billion, including $671 million in ticketing client cash and $1.2 billion in net concert event related cash, with a free cash balance of $374 million. Cash flow from operations was $761 million compared to $517 million in the first quarter of 2016, with the increase driven by higher event-related deferred revenue. Free cash flow adjusted was $27 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $25 million last year on the same basis. Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $57 million, with maintenance CapEx of $25 million and revenue-generating CapEx of $33 million, compared to a total of $25 million in the first quarter of 2016, with the increase driven by technology and venue enhancements. We currently expect total capital expenditures of approximately $220 million for the full-year 2017, with approximately 50% of that to be used for revenue-generating CapEx. For the full year, we estimate we will record approximately $60 million of accretion related to redeemable non-controlling interest. And lastly, as of March 31, our total net debt was $2.3 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 3.8%. Thank you for joining us today and we will now open up the call for questions, operator.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Two questions, one on guidance, and then one on ticketing. Joe, can you clarify your comments on guidance? Did I hear that AOI is going to be up mid-single digits? It just seems like with a 1Q beat and a seasonally stronger 2Q and 3Q, that it would imply a more dramatic slowdown in 4Q. So I just want to make sure I got that correctly. And then on the ticketing side, I think one point of investor concern continues to be competition on the secondary market. And given kind of what you've been able to accomplish, can you just point to some of the things that you're doing that separates you from your competitors? And then out of the 40 counties that you're present in, can you remind us how many ticketing platforms you have and if this is a bigger focus for you? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. I'll start with the guidance point, Amy. I was talking about the ticketing segment when I was talking about that point, which was that it's been a very strong Q1, because it was disproportionate to arenas and stadiums which tend to go on sale early. So it drove a very high Q1 performance. And then I was just saying, some of that for ticketing segment, not the overall business, was going to balance out for that guidance.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Amy, on ticketing. On ticketing, Amy, I mean, I think our numbers speak for it. We are continuing to grow our secondary business. That's pretty much a two-way race in ticketing. And as we've quoted before, Ticketmaster, historically was late to this party, and we've been making – the pie has been getting bigger and we've been increasing our market share continually year-over-year. And we're going to continue to do that for one reason, we have incredible primary scale at our store. So we have lots of customers that are going to come on a on-sale looking for a ticket in primary, that for 38 years we had a closed store, and now we have, most of the times, we have a secondary ticket option for that customer. So the more inventory we keep activating at our store called tm.com is how we're going to keep growing our GTA, more and more sports teams, venues and artists are adopting the idea of having a secondary option available in the primary purchase flow. So we think we have more inventory to activate and the double-digit growth we've been expensing year-over-year, we would expect secondary growth to be a strong growth driver for years to come. Second point is, we're only getting started in the European global side of the business, where we're seeing great growth, where we weren't last to get to the market, in most of those cities, Londons and UKs and Germanys, we are first or it's a still very new market that we're entering. So we think we have a lot of runway on a global basis to grow secondary business. About 40 countries we promote in, we would be in about 29. But let's call it 15 to 16 of strong ticketing markets right now for us. So you could see that there's great opportunity to keep driving ticketing growth through our content business in those 40 markets.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, and Amy, I would just point to Germany, I think it's a great example of how we think about the flywheel working with ticketing, which is we had an offer of ticketing business in Germany, but it wasn't a real substantial one. As we have gone into the promotion side there in a big way, and as Michael said, our Number 2 European market now, we're able to drive a lot of those tickets to the Ticketmaster business, which builds the brand, establishes it, helps to get other clients, and now has a much more – we now have a much more substantial business in Germany. So that's the model we like and we we'll continue to look for opportunities to replicate that.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Joyce with Evercore ISI.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. Couple of questions. Just help us understand your domestic versus international split. If you could talk about how much of your ticket sales – the number of tickets sold domestically versus internationally both on fee-bearing and non-fee-bearing, just to get a sense of that geographic split? And then also if you could provide some thoughts about how much of the sponsorship and advertising is domestic versus international? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Just on the tickets, first of all, what I said was is that North America is up 10%, international is up 11%. So, they're both up. That's the fee-bearing tickets, they're both up strong this quarter. We haven't historically broken out the non-fee-bearing. They tend to be much more North America driven, because they're tied in with season tickets. But that's not really obviously a material driver of our economics. And then on the sponsorship side, we don't give exact breakdowns, but over the course of the year, it's kind of a two-thirds:one-third, 60:40 type of split on the sponsorship, which pretty much aligns with our overall concert business split.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. If I could just add another separate question, where are you in the integrating Amazon as a ticket selling partner?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, in the UK, where it has always been an allocation market, we would be feeding them some tickets, I think maybe 3%, 4% tickets, most in the UK, allocates out to a host of retailers. So we would be doing that and allocating across multiple platforms. Ticketmaster is still selling the large majority of the tickets, but then we allocate out to lots of retailers in the UK. So that would be the only market where Amazon would be selling a few tickets. In the rest of the world, we continue to look at our APIs, top partner strategy, from Groupon to Spotify to other partners and we'll continue to look at the right incremental partnership.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brandon Ross with BTIG.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So taking a step back and kind of a follow-up to David's question there, how do you think in today's world about distribution of tickets to best serve sports teams and artists? Your willingness to work with Amazon seems to indicate that you think it makes sense to decouple the front-end, the retailing portion, from the back-end, the enterprise level?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: And would you consider letting StubHub plug into sell Ticketmaster tickets? Then I have a couple others. Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So, take that in a few pieces, Brandon. So first of all, we absolutely think of our business in two pieces as providing that enterprise software solution on the clients, and secondly as providing the e-commerce and selling the tickets. So, just organizationally and thinking about the business, we've absolutely thought about we have two missions, and we have to be great at both missions to ultimately achieve the market share and the positioning that we want to achieve. I think specifically on the commerce side, as you said, taking a step back, Ticketmaster's job is to sell every possible ticket for its sports teams, artists and other content. So the first step in that is our creating the best possible sites, online and mobile, that attract and convert fans. And Michael talked and gave some statistics around the continued success we're having in buildings that. And then the second step is finding additional sales channels to sell incremental tickets. And we've been doing this forever in the Ticketmaster business called Affiliates. It's the technology that now changes and makes that look a little bit differently. But the affiliates that we have today and the ones that we use our API with, the ones like the Facebooks and the Bandsintown, they act as marketing leads for us to then transact the tickets. And our studies have absolutely shown we drive incremental sales through those marketing leads. And then the second step for us is we're looking at other commerce sites that we're confident will sell incremental tickets generally against a different database, a different customer that they can reach on some sort of advantaged basis generally with a different value proposition. And I think Groupon is our most successful example here, where they've gotten a different ticketing offer to a different customer, and again, track and analyze the highly incremental sales force. So I mean rather than give a specific answer about any other specific player, really the point is, if we are convinced that we can sell incremental tickets for our clients, then we will look at any platform. But that is the basis by which we make that assessment.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. And then for Verified Fan seems to be pretty successful. Just a point of curiosity, why not use Facebook login for that and kind of let them do the work for you, since they're so proactive in cutting down who's a real person and who's not?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Absolutely, we use the social profile as part of it. The challenge is that they're continually having to scrape and delete false accounts as well. And in the rush of an on-sale or over what could be a day or so, you don't want to be dependent on any single point. So we'll take a social sign-in along with other data, put it against our proprietary database against all of our fans, all of our fan data, and use our own scoring system to try to create what we think is the most fair, best way to get the tickets to the fans. And then I would also say that it's going to be a continually evolving process, because once the scalpers figure out your algorithm, if they can back into it, you have to update it, change it and continually renew it.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. And then just more of a housekeeping, on the guidance. The same guidance for overall AOI, is that still in line with historical rates as you said on the prior call?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. So, I don't think we've given guidance for the overall business. We gave guidance on sponsorships that that will continue at historical rates, and on ticketing, that will be mid- to high-single digit AOI growth. I think those are the two pieces we've given guidance on.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Thank you very much for the questions.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Brandon.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Tinker with Gabelli.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Hi. Thank you. Just couple of quick questions. You've mentioned Germany a couple of times. I noticed that CTS Eventim, they still refers to themselves as the European market leader. Given you've had an interesting history with them, what's your sort of relationship with them there, and would it be fair to discuss what you sort of think your market share is in Europe overall?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Always fun, John. I haven't looked at their latest data. They're obviously Number 1 in Germany. That would be the only place that they would be Number 1 in. We would be Number 1 across Europe on concerts and I would assume total ticket sales. But regardless, we're in 40 countries with scale and they are a very strong German company with some market expansion through Europe. But we're competitors. We compete on the concert and the ticketing side. Good news is the pie is growing for everybody. So I assume they're doing well, and we think we can pick up a lot more share in Germany and the rest of the world, regardless of what their activity is.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: And since I noticed that I think you resigned with Jay-Z, but it was very much positioned as a purely keeping involve – been able to – as the strongest company been able to pay the most to keep the best talent, and the 360 deal, is it totally over?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, we never officially talk whether we renewed Jay or not. That's just good speculation post that was running. But for the record, yes, we are not in the 360 business; we haven't been for years. We're in the long-term securing touring business. And Jay has been an incredible partner of Live Nation. And we hope to be in the Jay-Z, and assume to be in the Jay-Z touring business for a long time, where we both can do what we do best.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah, thanks. I know you're not breaking out Artist Nation anymore obviously, but can you, Kathy, can you talk at all about the impact that had on the combined entity now? Was it up, down, flat? That would be helpful. And then second, Joe, in terms of the second quarter being stronger than normal, can you discuss any impact that would have on the third quarter? Thanks.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Doug, we can't really break it out since it's something we're not really providing. And just remember, as we've talked about it, it's really just there to drive the overall concert business, and you'll see that overall impact in the full year.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: But it wouldn't be marginally up or down to make a difference to the core numbers you're reading, Doug.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And then on the Q2, Q3, I think the best way to frame this, Q3, look, the whole summer looks very solid, looks very strong, lots of growth. Q2, and frankly Q1 was – well, we talked about the big growth in attendance – is where we have seen and we are confident on the very high level of growth. We expect Q3 to be as good or better than last year. It's just that Q2 was even stronger.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue. So at this time, we'll go ahead and end today's conference. We appreciate your participation.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Christy, and I will be your conference facilitator today.

Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. Live Nation delivered a sixth consecutive year of record results across revenue, AOI and free cash flow, with revenue up 17%, operating income 47% and AOI 12% at constant currency. Our three core divisions, concerts, ticketing and advertising, each delivered their strongest AOI results in the history of the company. We continue to see tremendous power of the live event, with strong consumer demand and robust supply of new and established artists, hitting the road from clubs to stadiums. Live is truly a unique entertainment form that cannot be duplicated and creates lifetime memories that fans today are craving more than ever in this experienced economy. We believe the live business will continue to have strong growth for years to come as fans drive demand, artists are motivated to tour, and technology drives conversion. On the concert business, Live Nation continued to grow its global concert market share, adding 7 million fans in 2016 for a total of over 71 million fans, driving revenue up 20% and more than doubling concerts AOI. We built our global leadership position in every part of our business with double-digit fan growth in both North America and international, and across all channels of stadiums, amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. We continued expanding our global footprint in 2016, as we added promoting offices in Germany, South Africa and Israel, taking us to over 40 countries worldwide. Across all markets, we invested $4.4 billion to stage 26,000 shows, ranking Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in the music business. Average ticket prices for our show increased by 5% in 2016. These increases were driven largely by higher pricing for the best tickets, as artists moved to more effectively capture the true value from their shows versus leaving billions outside the event P&L. Onsite, our average spend grows well. Amphitheaters spending grew by 9% to over $22, as we added more high-end products, improved the quality of our offering and increased our point-of-sale. Our growth is continuing into 2017, a further sign of a tremendous fan demand for concerts and the success of our global platform. Ticket sales are up double-digit year-on-year through February 2017, driven by sales for arena and stadium shows. And we are confident we will again see strong demand across the business this year. Our advertising unit continued with its strong consistent growth profile with revenue up 15% and AOI 10% in 2016. 71 million fans onsite provides a unique advertising platform for our sponsors to touch fans directly at scale. And as brand spend more on events, Live Nation is poised to capture these dollars, given the direct fan touch, its scale, data insights and digital footprint. We saw this movement in 2016, with our top strategic sponsors, were a key driver for our growth. We now have over 50 plus brands who spend over $1 million per year with us, a collective spend of $245 million, up 20% from last year. Sponsorship in our festival portfolio continued to be very attractive for brands with sponsorship growth of 18% across our festival portfolio. And at the same time, we continue to amplify our onsite events with online mobile reach. In 2016, we generated over 4 billion views across Live Nation sites and platform partners including Snapchat, Facebook and YouTube, providing our brand partners with further scale and reach. We expect continue advertising AOI growth at historic levels in 2017, with 70% of our budgeted advertising revenue for the year already contracted, and pacing double-digit ahead of last year at this time. In 2016, Ticketmaster continued growing its global leadership in ticketing with fee-bearing GTV up 16% and overall GTV up 11% to $28 billion at constant currency, while delivering 480 million tickets to fans in 28 countries. Our secondary business continues to have robust growth with GTV up 26% in 2016. Overall, the Ticketmaster platform continues to demonstrate its effectiveness at selling tickets to fans, with 6 of the top 10 sales months ever recurring in 2016 and conversion rates up across both online and mobile platforms. Our recent investment in Ticketmaster's enterprise platform, an open API, now allow clients to sell tickets on partner sites, driving the sale of over 10 million tickets in 2016. This has further deepened our relationship with teams and artists who are looking for enhanced reach with sites such as Spotify, Bandsintown, Facebook, Groupon, Costco and more to come. With this combination of stronger than ever ticketing platform increased broad distribution, Ticketmaster is better positioned than ever to continue growing its global leadership position in ticketing. This success is continuing into 2017, as ticket sales are up 9% through February 17, positioning us for continued growth. Overall our success in 2016 reconfirms that Live Nation has created an unparalleled live platform, bringing 550 million fans in 40 countries that's unrivaled two hours of live events. The live business continues to have strong growth opportunity with artists touring as their primary source of income and fans showing up record levels across the globe for that lifetime experience. All of this creates tremendous runway for Live Nation to continue delivery, the level of growth we have demonstrated over the last several years. As I've already indicated, the key leading indicators for each of our businesses on a year-on-year basis into February are pointing to another strong year in 2017. With that I'll turn over to Joe, who will take you through additional details on the deliverables on each division.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts. For the full year, Live Nation Concerts revenue was up 20% and AOI was up 125% on constant currency. We grew our attendance by 12% to a record 71 million fans, once again promoting the vast majority of the top global tours including Beyoncé, Coldplay, and Guns N' Roses. For the year, looking at markets in North America, attendance grew by 12%, 48 million fans with show count up 4% and attendance per show up 7%. And stadiums and amphitheaters were each up by about 2 million fans. Internationally, attendance was up 13% driven by a 2 million fan increase in stadium attendance. Globally, we continued growing our festival portfolio, adding 11 festivals to give us a global portfolio of 85 festivals in 12 countries. As a result, we increased festival attendance by 15% to over 7 million fans, and now have 23 festivals that each attract over 100,000 fans. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, concert revenue was up 3% and AOI up 45%, both at constant currency. These results were driven by a favorable shift in show mix with more fans at higher priced arena and stadium shows, while overall attendance was flat year-over-year for the quarter. As we move into 2017, as Michael said, ticket sales are up with over 28 million tickets already sold for shows this year. And our confirmed show pipeline for amphitheaters, arenas, and stadiums is up 11%, with three artists, Coldplay, U2 and Bruno Mars already selling over 1 million tickets each for tours this year. At Artist Nation, revenue was down 2% at constant currency in 2016 and most importantly, our Artist Nation artists continue to be a key feeder to our concerts flywheel. And in 2016, these artists performed for over 7 million of our fans in almost 600 shows. Turning to sponsorship & advertising, it delivered 15% revenue and 10% AOI growth for the year at constant currency and in the fourth quarter at constant currency, revenue was up 22% and AOI was up 11%. Finally Ticketmaster, in 2016 ticketing revenue was up 13%, while AOI was up 6%, as we grew global GTV on fee-bearing tickets by 16%, all at constant currency. Primary ticket fee-bearing GTV was up 15% at constant currency for the year, with concerts leading this growth with over a $1 billion increase in GTV. Secondary ticketing GTV was up 26% for the full year at constant currency, with concerts and the major sports leagues similarly contributing to this growth. Mobile ticketing continued growing rapidly, up 36% to over 45 million tickets sold in 2016 as we continued improving our mobile website and apps. Ticketing margin declined 1.1% year-on-year as we continued growing our global platform, both geographically and with new products. We entered four new countries in 2016 as we continued focusing on expanding our international business, substantially in markets that have a lower service fee structure and therefore lower margin profile than the traditional U.S. business. Similarly, we delivered very strong growth in both our Front Gate festival platform and our Universe do-it-yourself business in 2016, with ticket sales up almost 30% and more than doubling respectively. Continued expansion into these markets and product lines is core to our global ticketing strategy, one which has been successful in growing our customer base, ticketing volume and profitability over the past several years, and which we expect to continue being successful going forward. For the fourth quarter, global fee-bearing GTV was up 15%, revenue was up 11% and AOI down 4% at constant currency. And secondary GTV grew by 13%, while primary GTV was up 15%, both at constant currency. In summary, in 2016 each of our core businesses grew revenue and AOI. Looking forward in 2017, we expect to continue our growth based on our leading indicators. In concerts, show count and ticket sales for shows this year are both up double-digits. Sponsorship & advertising has sold over 70% of their budgeted activity for the year, pacing double-digits ahead of last year. And ticketing sales volume is up 9% through mid-February. Together, this gives us confidence that we will continue growing our business at historical rates. A few points of note, first from a phasing standpoint with our planned strong summer concert season, particularly with festivals and stadiums, we expect our AOI to be even more Q3 driven this year. As a result, we expect Q1 as a percentage of full year AOI to be lower than last year. And on FX, we ended 2016 with a 2% impact on revenue and a 1% impact on AOI. At this point, we don't see a material impact on 2017 numbers. I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with our results for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased by 4% to $1.8 billion, and AOI was $83 million. Revenue improved 5% to $1.83 billion on a constant currency basis. Ticketing contributed to more than half of the overall revenue growth, up 11% at constant currency, driven by increased volume in both our primary and resale businesses. Fourth quarter concert revenue was also up 3% at constant currency, driven by higher ticket prices from show mix. Strong profit growth in our concert segment, along with higher advertising results, largely drove our AOI performance in the fourth quarter. Operating loss was $37 million in the fourth quarter, an improvement of 8% compared to last year. Net loss for the quarter was $101 million, compared to a loss of $78 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Results were negatively impacted by $14 million in expenses associated with refinancing our debt in October, additional interest expense of $5 million, primarily due to the timing of the 7% note redemption, and $4 million due to the timing of income attributable to non-controlling interest. And now for the full year results. Revenue was $8.4 billion, an increase of 15%, and AOI was up 11% to $640 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue improved by 17% to $8.5 billion and AOI was $646 million, an increase of 12%. Free cash flow was $352 million as compared to $335 million in 2015. All of our core segments, concerts, sponsorship & advertising, and ticketing delivered strong revenue growth for the year. The majority of our overall revenue increase was driven by the concert segment, which was up 20% in constant currency, primarily from higher global stadium activity, as well as arena and amphitheater events in North America. Concerts revenue also benefited from higher ancillary onsite revenue at our North America amphitheaters this year. Ticketing revenue increased 13% at constant currency, with higher global primary and resale volume. And sponsorship & advertising revenue was up 15% at constant currency from new or expanded sponsorship programs, higher online advertising and increased festival activity in North America. The 12% growth in our overall AOI for the full year at constant currency was driven by all our core segments delivering growth in AOI during the year. Concerts AOI more than doubled as a result of higher event activity along with an increase in onsite ancillary spend. Our advertising business continued to deliver strong AOI growth of 10% at constant currency from higher sales. As we mentioned last quarter, we recorded a bad debt reserve of $6 million related to a client going out of business in Q3. This impacted our full year AOI growth in this segment by almost 3%. And our ticketing segments' AOI was up 6% at constant currency, driven by the higher primary and resale volume during the year. Operating income was $195 million, an increase of 48% over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. Net income for the year was $3 million, compared to a loss of $33 million in 2015. For the full year, we recorded $50 million related to the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interests from certain acquisition-related put/call arrangements that impacts the calculation of earnings per share. We expect accretion of $60 million in total for 2017 based on our current holdings. And finally, amortization of non-receivable ticketing contract advances for 2016 was $86 million compared to $88 million in 2015, including purchase accounting impact. Beginning in 2017, we will move from four to three reportable business segments: concerts, sponsorship & advertising, and ticketing. We believe combining our concerts and Artist Nation segments will more accurately reflect the activities of our concerts business by including the full range of services we provide to artists. Moving to our balance sheet, as of December 31, we had total cash of $1.5 billion, including $591 million in ticketing client cash and $525 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $411 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $597 million in 2016, compared to $308 million in 2015. This growth came from higher net income and an improvement in net working capital, driven by increased cash received for future events along with timing of payables. Free cash flow for the year was $352 million, up 5% over last year, driven by the growth in our AOI. Free cash flow as a percentage of AOI was 55%. This percentage was impacted by higher distributions to non-controlling interests and non-consolidated affiliates in 2016. $26 million of this increase was driven by investing in new or increased equity interest along with a multi-year distribution that was paid in 2016. Without this impact, our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI would have been 59% and we expect our free cash flow percentage to return to historical levels for 2017. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $187 million, essentially split between maintenance and revenue generating items. The increase this year was primarily due to technology system enhancements and venue related projects. For 2017, we expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $220 million, with about half of this towards revenue generating expenditures. Following our debt refinancing in October, our total net debt as of December 2016 was $2.3 billion with a weighted average cost of 3.8%, down from 4.3% at the end of the third quarter. As we look forward to 2017, our total deferred revenues for future shows, our key leading indicator, was $722 million at the end of 2016, up 30% over the $553 million last year, another factor pointing to the strength of our 2017 concert pipeline. Thank you for joining us today and we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: First, we'll take John Janedis from Jefferies. Your line is open.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Thank you. Michael, there has been a lot of focus on ticketing with the potential for new entrants from Amazon to much smaller players. So as you look out for this year and beyond, do you anticipate much of a change in the competitive landscape or the profitability or fee structure of the industry more broadly?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, we don't see that the core profitability of the business changing. Service fees are a pretty vital part of the client business. So the service fees are driven by the client, and majority of that go to the sports team or the venue or the artist, ultimately. So we don't see the economics change. It's – tickets always been a competitive industry. I think the – some of the pivotal moves that we made over the last few years on our platform, predicting that eventually we would have to become more flexible for our clients and build a better platform that was more open than closed, TM+ when we put secondary on our platform with the start of opening up a historically closed platform. And then the APIs that we've talked about over the last year, of really looking to figure out how to power that buy button and allocate tickets to other platforms that can increase conversion such as the Groupon's and the Facebook's, Spotify's and we're having conversations with Amazon and we'll look to allocate our API that way too if there is some incremental ticket sales that can occur. So, we think the – the core value of Ticketmaster at the core is incredible system software that helps clients sell tickets. We have an incredible great marketplace, one of the largest websites in the world that's growing stronger every year and we think we're also going to make sure that our clients and artists and fans through our new platform have the opportunity to enhance in their reach also through these platforms. So, we think that, the fact we've embraced over the last couple of years, this idea that having multiple points of sale is good for our business, that increases sales, and ultimately in Live Nation core business, our 70 million plus fans, lots of shows are unsold, lots of fans don't know about shows still. So, we're all supportive of having a wider distribution platform selling concert tickets to increase ultimately the sale.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: All right. Thanks, Michael. And maybe separately, you know appreciating the comments on the segment at least historically. Can you talk more about Artist Nation, obviously costs have ticked up over the past couple of years along with margin pressure and I was hoping you could speak to that, maybe the underlying health of that business and any secular headwinds that maybe emerging?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. We've been very consistent on that segment. It's – we don't consider it a core segment in itself, we've always considered it a very important, strategic piece of the business to power our core business. So this year, we had some investments in certain of the management companies that brought down some of the margin. But overall, we like that business, it's a very high margin business, it's a very accretive business when we bring in partners. And more importantly, it's great to be close to the talent, if you can feed your core businesses to drive your overall segment. So we like the business. We're going to keep – we think being closer with artist managers and having over up to 300 artists in your portfolio, while decisions on what promoter and what sponsors to play with and what ticketing companies can help you are smart, strategic businesses to be in. And we think 2017 will actually be a stronger year for that division as it's got a robust touring schedule ahead for them.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Amy Yong with Macquarie. Your line is open. Ms. Yong, your line is open.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi, can you hear me?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Now I can.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hello?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Amy, we can hear...
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Sorry about that. So, first question is for Kathy, on the $220 million CapEx guidance, can you talk about where the revenue generating CapEx is being allocated to? And perhaps, where the growth is actually going to come from and where we should see that on the top line? And then as you start generating cash, can you just talk about priorities of cash, given some of the M&A activity that you've seen? Thank you.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. So basically the $220 million will be spent on ticketing, as it has in the past, generally. And then in concerts, we have some opportunities with venues for expansion of the overall footprint, there we're going to be putting the money into. So those are the main drivers for the change. And, sorry, and then continuing on the onsite part, continued VIP as well as food and beverage changes as we've been doing in 2016. As far as where we're...
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sorry?
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: No, I'm sorry.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And then as far as where we're putting the money, there's no change in what we've been saying. So we're continuing to invest in the business and that's revenue generating CapEx, that's acquisitions, that's advances to artists and clients. So I don't see any change in that direction in 2017.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. And just on the onsite revenue which grew 9%, and I think a lot of people think there is a long runway for growth here and it's pretty achievable. Where do you think that that can go?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, Amy, this is Joe. I think we've said on a few occasions that we benchmark ourselves against sports teams in that regard. We're at about $22 for our amphitheaters right now. We think that over time that could be a $30 kind of number for our fans at the amphitheaters.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And next we'll go to David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Just on concerts. I think this was the best Q4 in terms of AOI, at least since the merger with Ticketmaster. Was this entirely driven by mix or were there other factors at play here such as higher ancillary spending? Just trying to get a sense for the strong performance.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I think, number one as we called out was the mix and just the volume of some of the bigger shows. Michael also talked about the higher ticket pricing that flowed through, particularly on the front of the house, which helps a lot in the concert business. And then, yes, onsite, all of the BIF (27:33) that flowed through for festivals or amphitheaters into the early part of the fourth quarter.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just with Lollapalooza expanding to another location in Paris this year, how much of an ongoing opportunity do you see to take some of your festival brands and bring them abroad?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, we think Lolla's just got a real exceptional profile. It's one of the few brands that has been able to expand to South America, now into Europe successfully. So, we see that brand as very global with – we got a runway of growth planned for that brand around the world. And our Electric Daisy brand in Vegas, the largest dance festival in the world, now in Mexico this week – next week, we will sell 200,000 tickets to that EDC Mexico edition that we started a couple of years ago. So we see that EDC now in Europe and in Brazil and Mexico and Japan. So, we think, out of our 80 plus brands, we have a very central strategy around what brands can move or what best practices can move. So we think there's a few others that have some potential.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And next, we'll take Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I always get a smidgen nervous when things get reclassified or combined. But I recognize Artist Nation is pretty small. Is there any reason to believe that the revenues or adjusted operating income at Artist Nation will change from sort of the historic levels once we mash this together with concerts? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: It is purely, I mean if you've listened to us earnings after earnings, we have three core businesses, and the management business is obviously paramountly strategic to our concert business, that's why we're in it. And it's where all of the material value is driven. So, we want to make sure that we just align that kind of activity around the outcome. We wake up every day talking to artist managers about what our market share is in the concert business, not whether they made $3 million or $4 million that year. So our core goal of all of that is to provide a great value to those artists and win over their touring business and drive it. So you don't get – when you separate it slightly and you get questions like the other one on what's the growth profile? To look at the growth profile, you have to say how many shows did you promote last year and what was that success rate. So we want to just align those activities against what the core mission is, just to drive our global touring business, and we use that as an investment strategy to do that.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Operator: And next, we'll take John Tinker with Gabelli. Your line is open.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thank you. A more general question. Well, two questions. One is, your largest shareholder's now actually Formula 1, and could you perhaps discuss where you think you fit into that? And secondly, what might the opportunities be given that Chase has said he really wants to turn each one of the races into a Super Bowl, and you can certainly look at the fact that Taylor Swift saved the event in Austin, and would that be material or is it just a small add-on?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I mean where Maffei and Malone decide to park their investment in us or what they call it, they're much smarter at that than I am. They've been incredible shareholders, they're long-term players as you know. So, we're aligned to the same principles. We want to grow long-term shareholder value and they've been great shareholders. So, I don't spend much time worrying about where they're housing their investment, it doesn't affect our day-to-day business. Greg is our Chairman, we talk strategy, not what ticker it will be under. As far as Formula 1, I've met Chase, big fan of his, his history, obviously, I don't know a lot about Formula 1. From what I've seen under the covers, it certainly looks like it's got a real untapped potential, little bit unique – a little bit relevant to our business in the sense that it's a global business with different local promoters, but they'll have to figure out how to centralize some strategies to extract some value. We don't think it's an overriding huge opportunity to the bottom-line, but we're absolutely talking of them as we would be talking always to the NFL. We've done it with the Indianapolis 500 in the past, NASCAR. If you got a race track, a lot of people and a check book, we're willing to figure out how to enhance your event through entertainment. And, I think, they're very motivated to reinvent the experience, and we'll – we're going to see if we can help them on a few of those.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Just one more quick question. What's your NOL now and at what point would you anticipate beginning to pay more tax?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hold on while I pull up the total, not really much change and we still have several years, John, before we think that we'll be a U.S. taxpayer. As you know, we pay state and we pay some Federal, but we're several years out from hitting that.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll take David Joyce with Evercore ISI.
David Joyce - Evercore ISI: Thank you. I wanted to touch on the ticketing margins. Again, Joe you had mentioned how you entered four more countries in the past year, and that impacted the margins a little bit. You also more recently entered Israel and Eastern Europe. Could you help us think about the margins for 2017 in terms of how far along you are in integrating the acquisitions from last year as well as the new additions to the footprint? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, the acquisitions are integrated. I don't think that's the issue. The issue is, as when you enter a new market, you're going to be at a lower scale and most of these markets are also lower service fee as a percentage of your ticket price often times and some of them you're also a lower ticket price. So, your margin profile is just going to be structurally lower in those markets. So, as we've talked, our overriding focus at Ticketmaster is to continue to drive the global sales of that business. On our platform, as Michael talked through the open APIs, off of our platform, we've served the teams and the artists by selling their tickets more effectively and selling more of them. That means more countries, it means more other platforms like the Front Gate and do-it-yourself platform that I talked about. And in a lot of those cases, those tickets that we sell, the incremental ticket maybe at a lower margin then some of the other tickets, but it continues to build the business, serve our customers and drive the overall cash profitability of the business. So that playbook has worked pretty well for the past five years, and we expect to continue doing that over the next few years. I don't think we're at a point that we're going to declare what the margins are for 2017 in that business right now, but you can expect us to overall continue to do everything we can to grow the business.
David Joyce - Evercore ISI: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll take John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Joe, I want to ask a little bit about the Ticketmaster business. On secondary (35:36) I think you said gross ticket value grew 26%. Is there a way that you can help us think about maybe which units of ticket are growing on that platform? And as you study that business and how it's evolving, how you feel your share kind of shook out within the industry in 2016 and maybe how you're thinking compared to a year ago?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. So, again, I think stepping back, John, the first thing that we always look at when we talk about the secondary business is that it's $8 billion value that is sitting outside the P&L of the artists and the teams that are driving the content. And so, we then have a two-part strategy. One is, how do we through the concert side and through the ticketing side work with the artists in particular to remove as much of that price arbitrage as we can. And how do we work with the team to make sure they've got both the data as well as the marketing capability to remove their arbitrage. And we will always be most successful, the more that we can drive that arbitrage back into the primary side of the house. And again, Michael talked earlier about the price increases that we were seeing as artists are becoming – this is becoming very transparent and artists are seeing it and understanding it and therefore, they are going after that money. So item number one is, we're attacking it that way. Item number two has been, yes, as long as there is price inefficiency, we are going to be focused on building the best secondary offer out there for fans to transparently easily get their tickets, have them verified and have a great experience with it. So we had a lot of success in growth of our market share and of our overall business in 2016, I expect that continued in 2017. But we also don't – we just don't obsess over which column is it in. Frankly, we'd rather have more in column A than column B. But that's going to depend as we work with every artist and every team on what agenda they want.
John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Fair enough. I'd want to ask just about capital allocation going forward. If I think about the evolution of the company you guys have grown AOI at record levels for a number of years, and the free cash flow has been great and you guys have kind of grown it to the leverage of the business. As I think about that, is there any kind of changing thought process in terms of how you think about allocating capital? Does returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks start to become more of a priority for the company than it has been historically?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No. And we absolutely believe that every opportunity that we've seen over the last five years exists more today than at any other point. As we go into more markets, that gives us the scale and infrastructure to continue going into more markets. As we build our management teams, our technology platforms, very focused on delivering the fans and our clients on a global basis, we just think we're better at it and we're better able to go into markets than either build or acquire additional assets, keep doing exactly what we've been doing.
John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we have Doug Arthur with Huber Research.
Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah. Thanks. One of the numbers that really jumped out all year long was the average attendance per event. I think it was up globally about 9% for the year. How much of that was just the mix this year, because you had a lot of big stadium tours and how much of it was sort of this long-term strategy of trying to better sell out the house? Then I've got a follow-up.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Doug, it was obviously both, and we haven't given the exact breakdown, but we're benefited by the large increase in stadiums that I called out, 2 million increase in each North America and international. But even when you back that out, absolutely in 2016 across the board, we did continue to see that we were growing attendance per show at our amphitheaters, at our arenas, stadiums as we were continually better at marketing and pricing the product, distributing the ticket sale to hit every fan everywhere that we could, and that continues to be a priority in 2017.
Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then a follow-up. You talked a lot about the momentum in sponsorship. Where are you at from a progress point of view, in terms of monetizing your digital audience, in terms of digital advertising?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think monetizing our digital audience the way we think about it, Michael alluded to a bit is, our truly unique positioning starts with our 70 million fans. These other people have online assets as well. And so, what we're really seeing with the online business is that when you're talking to a sponsor about a large strategic platform for their brand and their brand strategy for reaching out, touching a target customer, that the online is an enhancement and augmentation that gives us an additional set of ad units, gives us additional reach against the core of our onsite interaction, activation that we can deliver.
Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next we have Kyle Evans from Stephens.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. You talked a little bit about the dynamics in the secondary market and how much money is outside the artists P&L. We saw the expected slowdown at StubHub, as they annualized some of their process changes. Could you give us an updated view on the competitive landscapes specifically as it relates to StubHub? And then I have some follow-ups.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I think as we've said all along that our view is we're focused on the business as StubHub has gotten refocused and on the business as well and as a few others, Vivid here, Viagogo internationally, that we all have the capability to invest a lot of dollars on brand, on customer acquisition. You probably see some concentration amongst some of the larger players that are now fighting out for the volume and the share.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And you...
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And also just to add to that, we always kind of get a little U.S. centric here, but we've been very effective on a global basis of moving faster than the historic Ticketmaster that we inherited did here. So in the UK, Australia, all across Europe where we have launched a secondary platform, we are number one, close to number one. I mean StubHub really is only strong in America. They are obviously expanding, but we wanted – global basis, we're seeing great success as we're either a leader or an early entrant into a lot of the markets. So we see on a global basis, we'll continue to have market share growth on that segment.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Great. I know it's early, but you've given us this February 17 show pipeline number in the supplemental. If attendance stays strong and you've got – you are at 11% on show growth in amphitheaters, arenas, and stadiums. Aside from an economic slowdown, are there any other scenarios where you would expect that metric to tick down over the course of the year into the single-digits?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey, I think we are seeing artists confirming and putting on their shows earlier and earlier, which is great, because it gives us more clarity on the volume of activity we're going to have. I think if you looked over time, that number probably ticks down modestly and we weren't giving it to give a specific, this is exactly how much many more shows we're going to give. We gave it to indicate we believe the business will continue to grow in 2017.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. We're deep into the call, maybe this is a little nitpicky, but your overseas cash jumped up by a couple hundred million to $712 million and in the case, as you don't plan to repatriate, how should we be thinking about that cash number?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: A lot of that is part of the deferred revenue at year end, so they've sold tickets for future shows as well, so the reason why we say we don't repatriate, it will be used for their events and pay artists, et cetera.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. How much of that's not deferred?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I'm sorry?
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: You said a lot of that is from deferred?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. It's going to be primarily deferred, sponsorship, all kinds of things. We don't have more granularity to give you on that, but generally, our cash is going to tick up with the deferred revenue.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next we'll take Ben Mogil from Stifel.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. So good afternoon. Thanks for letting me on. So just wanted to go back, I guess to Kyle's question around the secondary market. Are the numbers that I think you were talking about around $8 billion market size, and I think you talked about it in 2015 being like in the $5 billion or the $6 billion range. Are these estimates still relatively loose, just given that there is a large part of the market which is kind of non-institutional if you will?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And are you finding that in general the two of you, you and StubHub collectively, are kind of gaining share not only as the market grows, but gaining share from independents or are the independents in collective sort of holding their own as well?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I would say we – I think StubHub has always had market leadership in the U.S. I think we've obviously grown strong and taken market share from the independents in the U.S. Outside of America, Viagogo and others have been out there and we would be the one taking market share from most of the independents in different countries.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And I apologize, because I got on the call late. I'm not sure if you talked much about – from the European, I know it's very early in terms of festival dates in Europe and particularly in the UK. Are you seeing any kind of weakness just given some of the economic sort of turmoil over there, if you will? Turmoil's my word, just the economic comments?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, no, we haven't seen – we had a strong 2016 in Europe obviously and international, and we're off in February to a strong on-sale right now across Europe. We don't see any slowdown in any countries right now. We see a very robust planned and on-sale so far.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thanks, Michael.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Ben.
Operator: And next, we'll take Brandon Ross with BTIG.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I actually just want to follow up on some of the earlier questions from the call. The first question is a follow-up on John Janedis' question. Michael, to be clear, do you view Amazon as a competitor or as a partner? And do you think the U.S. exclusivity model could be in jeopardy with Amazon and StubHub looking to be primary retailers? Then a follow-up on Amy's question on the CapEx. On ticketing CapEx, can you just help us decipher how you divide between revenue generating and maintenance CapEx there? It could be very kind of hard to unpack that. If you re-platform or move infrastructure to the cloud, do you consider that revenue generating or do you consider that maintenance? And then a follow-up on David's question, about margins. You mentioned international growth and the mix kind of there. But on the Q2 call, when we asked about down margins, you guys kind of reiterated that margins would end up flat for the year, despite the mix pressures in the middle of the year. What happened there that you did not anticipate in prior guidance that you gave? Thanks.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: That's all, Brandon?
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Well, I actually have one more, but I'll save it.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. We've been talking the last couple of years about an API open allocated market. We've been very clear that the rest of the world has always been allocation, and Ticketmaster does very well in those markets. We got a strong market leadership, generally at a lower cost per ticket. We've seen over the years that eventually – we always had kind of stated that we thought that more distribution points were going to be a reality in the business for clients. Why we were very aggressive over the last few years in building an API to help clients and artists, et cetera, have opportunity, like StubHub – Spotify and Bandsintown, and Groupon, and others. So, yeah, we believe that the smartest strategy for Ticketmaster as a software platform has always been to solve the client's needs, to create – to provide great platform software, provide a great marketplace and provide the flexibility to use partner sites to help augmented sales. Because as you know when you have as many customers as we do, you're the hottest team in the NBA, you're not that worried about partner sites. You're not really worried about Amazon if you're U2, which sold 1 million tickets in an hour. But if you are a team or an artist that like most of the business needs to sell a few extra tickets, you're always going to be looking for incremental distribution points. So we've always believed that being open API driven, letting our clients have opportunity to power other retail sites is a smart strategy for Ticketmaster, and we've been doing that over the last couple of years now, finding partner sites to augment sales.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: So you see Amazon as a partner then?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. We see them as a retail partner, absolutely.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Okay.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: On the CapEx question, think about it from new tools or new clients versus other things. So if we are adding technology to our mobile product or adding functionality to TM+, those things would be revenue generating. If we get a new client where we have to add hardware or make some changes, that's going to be revenue generating. Other things like your question on CapEx related to cloud, moving to the cloud or just replacing hardware, et cetera, would generally be maintenance.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Right. So, if you work on your mobile app, that would be considered revenue generating CapEx, you said?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. For adding new technology and new tools to it, absolutely.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So we sold 45 million tickets on mobile this year versus zero a few years back. So that obviously helps generate additional revenue.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Right.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: On the TM margin, you're right, six months ago we had a slightly different forecast for what the margin was going to be, and as you could imagine, a lot of things happened over the – a hundred (51:06) things happened over the six months as we unpacked it. It's really – a lot of it is what I called out. One is we had tremendous performance by our Front Gate ticketing business. That little festival focused ticketing business up 30% in terms of the volume of tickets that it sold. It's a fantastic product. It's been very successful with a lot of festivals, and if it has a little lower margin, okay. The same with the do-it-yourself at Universe more than doubling in terms of their ticket volume. So in some cases, you're a victim of your own success, driving the overall profitability of the business at the impact of some of the margin. But there is nothing dramatic, different. It was just all the pieces and how they came together. And as we said, we're happy as long as we're continuing to grow the cash profitability of the business.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Okay. And just one more on secondary. I think it was up 13% in Q3, then again 13% in Q4, even though it had reaccelerated I think early in Q4. What happened the rest of the quarter there? And do you foresee a reacceleration in secondary GTV in 2017 or do you think this is sort of a new normal that we should model off of?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I mean it's – as I talked through Brandon, we have two columns, the bringing it into the primary and building the secondary in. We're way too early to have a view on what's the mix of that that we think will be most successful in. We'd love to move that entire $8 million, shrink the secondary and bring it all into the primary, but a lot of that depends on our conversations with the artists and with the teams and exactly what they want to do and how they want to do it. So, we're not worried about again the forecast of that split as much as continuing to offer a great product on both and building the overall business.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Thank you for the questions.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: We have no further questions. That does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Live Nation had a record third quarter and 2016 is on track to deliver another year of record results across revenue, AOI, and free cash flow. For the quarter, revenue was up 23%, AOI up 15% at constant currency, and free cash flow up 21%. Our core divisions of concerts, ticketing, and Advertising, each delivered their strongest quarterly AOI results ever. Our concerts business is our flywheel, attracting 28 million fans to shows globally in the quarter, which drove record results in our ticketing, Advertising and on-site businesses. Our performance demonstrates how Live Nation has created the most unparalleled live platform, leveraging concert scale to drive growth across the full Live ecosystem. Our concert and ticketing sales continue to pace well ahead of last year and this give us confidence that 2016 would be another year of record results for Live Nation overall and for each of the core divisions. Looking at the concerts flywheel in the third quarter, we had 16% more fans attend over 6,000 shows, growing revenue by 27% and AOI by 38% year-on-year at a constant currency. Year-to-date, we have grown our fan base by 16% to 56 million on our way to we expect to be a record-setting 70 million fans attending Live Nation concerts in 2016. As we have discussed, increasing on-site monetization has been a major focus and year-to-date, we have increased average per spend at our festivals and amphitheaters by 10%, while growing attendance 13% at these events, thereby increasing total on-site spend by $70 million at constant currency. This high-margin spend has been a key driver of our growth concerts profitability in 2016. We have also benefited from ticket pricing initiatives; notably increasing the price on the most attractive tickets; and as a result, our average ticket price grew by 7% year-to-date. In our high-end margin Sponsorship business, we have continued to double-digit growth this year with revenue up 13% and AOI up 10% year-to-date at constant currency. The core of our Sponsorship and advertisement business is the ability to reach those 70 million fans attending Live Nation shows this year, now at a scale greater than the NFL, NBA and NHL combined. With over 27 million of these fans in the hard to reach 18- to 34-year-old demographic, we provide a unique platform for brands looking to drive engagement and activation. From this base of live fans, we leverage our database profiling nearly 300 million fans to help brands more effectively target potential customers. And on top of that, we have built our ad platform of streaming live concerts and creating content around our festivals and shows. So far this year, we have generated 3 billion views across Live Nation sites and platform partners including Snapchat, Facebook and YouTube, growing our ad units and providing brands with an amplified way to reach potential customers. Our platform is proving particularly attractive to those global brands looking to reach customers at scale, and through the third quarter, the 50-plus brands that spend over $1 million a year with us have increased their collective spend by 19% to over $225 million, which now account for 75% of our Sponsorship revenue. As a result, our contracted net revenue for the year is up 12% through October and over 95% of our planned Sponsorship under contract for the year. Given this, we are confidently we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth in our Sponsorship and Advertising business in 2016. Ticketmaster continues building its position as a global ticketing market leader with 14% growth year-to-date in global GTV to $19 billion on our way to over $27 billion for the year. Ticketmaster provides 480 million tickets to fans across 28 countries, making it by far the largest such marketplace. This has driven a 14% (sic) [12%] increase in ticketing revenue through the third quarter and a 9% increase in ticketing AOI. Investments in delivering an efficient mobile purchase process continue to improve the fan experience and year-to-date app installs are up 44% to nearly 30 million and mobile ticket sales up 38% to 27% of all ticket purchases. Similarly, our integrated secondary and primary ticketing output continues to benefit fans allowing them to see their options in one location, driving secondary GTV up 33% year-to-date to over $1 billion. With this success in selling tickets, Ticketmaster continues to attack new clients worldwide. This quarter we added 170 clients to our base of over 12,000, setting us up for the seventh consecutive year of growing ticket inventory. Going forward, we see attractive growth potential ticketing as we continue creating a new ticketing products, increasing conversion and expanding our reach with APIs through our third-party distributor commerce. In summary, we continue to rapidly grow our concert fan base, which is demonstrating the effectiveness of our flywheel, driving double-digit growth in Sponsorship, ticketing, and onsite. And as we look forward, we see tremendous opportunities to continue global consolidation of our concert business with further growth in onsite Advertising and ticketing. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through the additional details on the division performance.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments; first concerts. Live Nation concerts revenue in the third quarter was up 27%, and AOI was up 38% at constant currency. The revenue growth was driven by a 16% or 3.8 million fans increase in attendance for the quarter, with a 4% increase in show count and an 11% increase in attendance per show. Over our key summer months across Q2 and Q3, we increased fan attendance by over 7 million. Just this growth on a stand-alone basis would make us the third largest promoter in the world. Our growth was led by five artists performing to over 1 million fans each so far this year, including Beyoncé, Coldplay and Rihanna, all of whom performed both in the U.S. and internationally as we continue expanding the global terrain of our artists. And while our growth was led by stadium attendance of over 4 million fans so far this year, amphitheaters, arenas, festivals and theaters and clubs all increased their fan bases for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, North America drove much of the fan growth for the quarter with a very strong amphitheater business, so for the full year international fan growth continues to be over 20% year-on-year with strong growth across all building types. Looking to how we'll finish off the year in concerts, through October, ticket sales for shows this year are up 14% to over $61 million. And while we have a number of very strong tours in the fourth quarter and expect to get to 70 million total fans for the year, it does imply from a timing standpoint that the overall activity level in Q4 is a bit shifted into Q3 this year. As Michael discussed, we made great progress in growing our fan spending at the buildings we operate. Our U.S. amphitheater spending is up 10% to over $22 per fan. Our global festival spending is up a similar 10% to $17 per fan per day, all at constant currency. Collectively, these onsite initiatives in our fan growth has been the key drivers of our great concerts performance so far this year. Performance, we believe, will continue and be built upon in 2017 and beyond. At Artist Nation, revenue was up 11% and AOI down $1.4 million in the third quarter at constant currency. Based on artist touring timing, we now expect the fourth quarter and full year to be down from last year, but see a pickup in activity in 2017 as our management business continues to be a key strategic source through our concerts flywheel. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, revenue for the third quarter grew by 10% and AOI was up 8% at constant currency. AOI in the quarter was impacted by a bad debt reserve, and without this AOI for the quarter would have been up 14%, and for the year up 13% at constant currency. Our Advertising growth this year has been well-balanced between Sponsorship and online Advertising, with both parts of the business growing contribution margin double-digits year-to-date. On the Sponsorship side 14% growth in festival Sponsorship continues to demonstrate the value our platform of 80 festivals worldwide provides the brands looking for direct engagement and activation with 18-year-old to 34-year-old fans. And on the online Advertising side, we're seeing the benefits from our breadth of content initiatives: live streaming, editorial content and other music related video as we've broadened our distribution channels to now include Snapchat, Facebook, NextVR, and Netflix. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 8% and AOI up 4% at constant currency. Primary, ticketing, fee-bearing GTV was up 10% for the quarter and is up 15% year-to-date at constant currency. The GTV growth has been driven primarily by our concerts and art segments, each of which is up approximately 20% year-to-date. Secondary ticketing GTV was up 13% for the quarter and is up 33% year-to-date at constant currency. Similarly, last year Q3 was our lowest growth quarter and we have already seen an acceleration of our growth through October as the NFL, NBA and 2017 concert on sales have kicked in. And with this North America and international GTV each remains up 30% or more through October. More broadly, the Ticketmaster platform has never been more effective at selling tickets for our clients. September was one of our top 10 GTV months ever, and five of our top 10 GTV months in our history have taken place this year. At the same time, we continue building the effectiveness of Ticketmaster as a sales partner for content by leveraging the customer base and traffic of distribution partners, including Facebook, Groupon and Bandsintown. We have more than doubled the volume of tickets sold in the quarter via our API, and year-to-date our channel partners have driven 34% more in ticket sales than this point last year to over 8 million tickets. With our expected on sales for 2017 concerts in the fourth quarter and it being our largest quarter for secondary, we expect to deliver double-digit GTV growth and high single-digit AOI growth for the full-year in ticketing, both at constant currency. In summary, we're confident that 2016 will be another year of record top-line and bottom-line results overall and for each of our core businesses. We also expect to continue growing our free cash flow, enabling us to continue investing in these businesses for ongoing growth. On FX, Q3 revenue and AOI were impacted by about 1% with a British pound turning sharply negative while other currencies were generally flat to slightly positive. In terms of seasonality, we expect Q4 as the percent of full-year AOI to be in the same general range it was in from 2011 to 2014. And looking at our earliest leading indicator for 2017, the number of booked stadium, arena and amphitheater shows were up double digit from this point last year pointing to continued success of our flywheel business model headed into 2017. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with our results for the third quarter. Revenue increased by 21% to $3.17 billion, and AOI was 14% higher than last year at $303 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue improved 23% to $3.22 billion, and AOI was $304 million, up 15% over last year. Free cash flow was $251 million for the quarter, an increase of 21% over the third quarter of 2015. As we entered the fourth quarter, our concerts deferred revenue for tickets sold for events in the future was $417 million as compared to $441 million in September last year. The majority of our revenue growth in the third quarter was driven by a 25% increase in concerts with a significant increase in stadium activity globally along with increased show count in both amphitheater and arenas shows in North America. Ticketing revenue was up 7% over last year with higher volume in both our primary and resale businesses. The growth in our concerts business also largely drove the 14% increase in AOI over last year. Operating income in the third quarter was $191 million, 25% higher than last year and net income for the quarter was $111 million, up 25% over the third quarter of 2015, both driven by the increase in AOI. Moving on to the results for the first nine months. Revenue was $6.56 billion, an increase of 19%, and AOI was up 17% to $557 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue improved by 21% to $6.65 billion,; and AOI was $562 million, an increase of 18%. Free cash was $373 million, 15% higher than last year. The majority of our revenue growth for the nine months was again driven by the concerts segment, which was up 23%, primarily from the increased activity across stadiums, arenas, and amphitheaters. Ticketing revenue for the nine months increased 12% with higher primary and resale volume. And Sponsorship & Advertising revenue was up 11% from new clients and renewals of existing partnerships. During the third quarter, as Joe mentioned, we recorded a bad debt reserve of $6 million related to a Sponsorship client going out of business, which reduced the year-over-year AOI growth for the nine months in the Sponsorship & Advertising segment by 3%. The 17% growth in AOI for the first nine months was primarily from the higher concerts activity and ticketing volume. All of our segments delivered growth in AOI during the period. Operating income was $232 million, an increase of 35% over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. Net income for the first nine months was $104 million, more than double the net income for the same period in 2015. This increase is largely driven by our higher AOI along with a net $14 million reduction in non-cash expenses related to foreign exchange impacts on certain balance sheet accounts and other write-offs as compared to last year. For the full year, we estimate that we will record approximately $50 million related to the accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest from certain acquisition related put/call arrangements, which impacts the calculation of earnings per share. And finally, we expect the amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances for 2016 to be in line with the total amount in 2015. Moving to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1 billion, which includes $547 million in ticketing client cash and $314 million in net concert event-related cash leaving a free cash balance of $179 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $120 million in the first nine months compared to a use of cash of $15 million in the same period of 2015. This increase was largely driven by higher operating results along with an improvement in net working capital. Free cash flow was $373 million in the nine-months period as compared to $325 million last year driven by our higher AOI, net of increases in maintenance CapEx and partner distribution. For full-year 2016, we currently expect our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI to be similar to what it was in 2015. For the nine months, total capital expenditures were $121 million with approximately half of that for revenue generating items. We currently expect total capital expenditures for the 2016 full-year to be approximately $180 million to $185 million with about 50% of that to be spent on revenue generating CapEx. As of September 30, our total debt was $2 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. In October, we refinanced our senior secured credit facility and 7% senior notes in order to take advantage of more favorable interest rates and terms. We issued $575 million, a 4.875% senior notes due in 2024 along with the new $190 million term loan A and a $975 million term loan B. The interest rate on our term loan B improved from LIBOR plus 2.75% per year with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% to LIBOR plus 2.5% with no floor. As to repayment of our existing senior secured credit facility and the 7% senior notes, along with related redemption premiums interest and fees, we added approximately $257 million of cash to our balance sheet for future investment in our business. We also increased our revolving line of credit from $335 million to $365 million, which remains undrawn. As a result, our annual cash interest expense will be reduced initially by approximately $2 million and our weighted average cost of debt will decrease from 4.3% to 3.8%. We will record a loss on extinguishment for this refinancing in the fourth quarter of 2016, which we currently estimate to be between $14 million and $17 million. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Two questions, first, on ancillary revenue. You're now largely through two seasons with Legends as your concession partner at some your North America amps. Can you give a sense for how far along you think you are driving higher net revenue per fan? And how much opportunity remains at the amphitheaters than maybe at some of your other venue types? And then secondly, your release mentioned that you've been able to increase prices for best seats at your concerts. In the past you mentioned that price in front of the house close in a market should allow you to lower prices for the back of the house, which should in theory increase attendance. Just wondering if this is dynamic you're seeing play out. Thanks.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I'll start and Joe can jump in. On the ticketing, I think it's a double strategy. I think we've kind of stated over the last few years that just generally getting better at dynamically pricing the house, the concert business historically had been a very simplistic pricing model three or four different tiers for the same concert and all the same markets. So we've been a big advocate over the last few years of pricing the house differently on a Friday night versus a Monday in New York versus Chicago and also adding as many different scaling to the house as you can through the purchase cycle. So we've done it on both sides. We had great success on the Groupon side and looking at the discounted lower end of the ticketing business and that's driven purchase. And we think we have the start of a huge opportunity as everyone talks about the VIP secondary $8 billion, all of those facts that are used that they're still a big piece of business that customers and scalpers are accessing through our content. So we think we have a lot of opportunity on the front end of the house to keep pricing it through VIP, Platinum, P1, so the artist can share in the upside versus the secondary business. And we think as we also lower and look at discounts and ways to price the bottom end of the house, we've been driving overall growth per show as well as ticket sales per show. So, both of them working as planned and we think the big runway still ahead of us is we know that there is still hundreds of millions of dollars in secondary ticket. Revenue on top of what we're charging for P1's to date that provides opportunity.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: And David, this is Joe. On the ancillary, first of all, I mean, we've been very happy with Legends. They've done a great job ramping up and improving the offering to fans at our amphitheaters as we thought I think last year, with them getting their feet wet, making a few improvements. This year was really making those improvements at scale, experimenting at scale with wine bars, grab and go, craft beers, generally improved offering, and we've shown you the numbers from their doing that. That said, we absolutely believe we're still in the second, third inning of the improvements. I think we continue to benchmark ourselves against a well-performing ball club, and which extends the (23:22) per caps there in the $30 plus range and you see us in the $20s. And I think as we continue to improve the offer both for the mass offer, as well as continuing to target the VIP high-end people that want the great experience on the night out, that between those two areas we'll continue to be aggressive in driving the per cap spend over the next few years.
David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now move on to our next question from Ben Mogil with Stifel.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, I've got two of them. First one, so, Michael, in your prepared remarks, or actually I think in the press release, you talked about some of the extra artists payments that you were able to make to artists this year, sort of tied to the increase in ticket price, and sort of similar to what we hear companies sort of call out how much they're paying their suppliers. So, maybe you can frame that a little bit more for us, should we sort of assume that the splits that you have with the artists are unchanged, and that this increase is something that you're going to share in as well? Are you sort of trying to give a sense then of from a competitive positioning obviously the more money an artist gets the more likely they are to tour with you? I'm sort of curious around the commentary around the artist extra payments this year?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Nothing structural about the comment, nothing new on the splits. We absolutely like to remind the artist and the community that we spend over $3 billion to $4 billion a year paying the artists for their art. And I think as you've seen a lot of the other battles going on in the business, we've always believed that Live Nation could be an artist-centric, and having the artists aligned to our agenda has helped us grow the overall pie. But first and foremost, you have to pay the artist for his art. And that comment was just showing you, as we increase our business, the artist is doing well as well as our core business of growing our profitability.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's great. Thanks, Michael. And then one, I'm not sure for Michael or for Joe. On the ticketing, you certainly had nice growth in the secondary gross transaction value and it looks like kind of year-to-date you're in the same zip code as a StubHub in spite of (25:34) obviously, being significantly larger. So when you look at the secondary market, are you seeing the market grow and both of you are taking decent share? Maybe you can talk about the market growth as well as the competitive dynamics between the two of you and if there are any other players that you wanted to talk about as well?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. I think absolutely the market continues to grow, but we're taking share. No question. And yes, StubHub is, I think this year, had reasonable growth coming off some issues they had last year. But our focus is really just our belief that if we give fans a great offer, if we give them a great product, and it all starts with that product, primary and secondary together, leveraging the scale that we have of people coming to Ticketmaster and our ability to reach those fans by direct marketing to them that we will continue to grow and take share regardless of what everybody else does in the market.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's great. Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now move on to our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Thank you. Joe, your comments around bookings for 2017 were helpful given how strong this year has been to-date, and I guess the potential for next year to slow, so understanding you're not going to guide, is there any reason why bookings would come in significantly earlier for next year relative to this year?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, I think we're on a similar cycle as we were on last year. We just see a great pipeline of shows next year and wanted to make sure everybody understood that, that we didn't get some view that this year was unusual in the volume of activity that we had, and we're looking to enter next year very strongly.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then separately, I guess, given the ongoing currency and macro headlines, can you give us an update on your international M&A pipeline?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I love this, the simplistics of it. Yeah, let us lay it out for you. I think our pipeline on M&A continues to be, whether it's in America or international, we'll continue to look to build our scale in our core business. And whether it's a promoter in Nashville that can excel our business, a festival in America or in South America, we continue to look at promoters as well as festivals that can excel our inventory and that we can manage and build our flywheel around. So, we have an ongoing, always an ongoing active list, and we think we can continue to add a lot of bolt-ons that will continue to drive our overall scale at the right return.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take the next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Can I just go back to the per cap spending objectives? I think you guys have laid out this $5 per guest bogey. When you say you're in the second or third inning now, does that imply the we've sort of booked a $1 of that-ish so far off of that goal?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, no. Well, again, we've got a lot of fans. So, what we've done is in our amphitheaters and in our festivals, we grew at each of those about $2 per fan this year from the numbers I gave you. That represents roughly $15 million fans between those buildings that we operate where we have those initiatives with Legends on the amphitheater side and various folks on the festival side. So, I'm just speaking macro general terms. We've tested, we've tested at scale, we've delivered some results. There is now the opportunity to take to full rollout and scale some of those learnings as well as continue to increase the merchandise you were doing for all fans and a big step still to come in how we're delivering the experience on the VIP high-end.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research.
Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah, couple of questions. Looking at the margin in the concert business in the third quarter, obviously, that is a number that's moving up a lot, that's been one of your objectives, but the big number this quarter, how much of that is just sort of an extraordinary mix of tours out there this year and how much of it is sustainable? Then I have a follow-up.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Sure. Well, obviously, we've had a very good season in our amphitheaters, Doug. And along with a lot of the...
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Did you get that, Doug?
Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: I heard it. Yeah, I heard it.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I think it was a record actually, but you've got to check those sources.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: But I'm sorry, joking aside, we talked about the on-site ancillary spend, a lot of that is higher margin spend in terms of how that flow through for us, so nothing extraordinary in terms of the talent or the splits or the payments or anything like that with – on the artist side, really I think you're seeing the pickup is more because of the ancillary growth than anything else.
Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. So that sort of follows into – spills into my second question, which is we've kind of beaten around here a little bit, but your average revenue per attendee in this quarter approached almost $90 on average for all attendees. How much of that is a function of the mix in the quarter, because you had big stadium action in both Q2 and Q3 as opposed to the ticketing strategies and the ancillary or is it all the above?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Well, it's all the above clearly, but you can parse out, we've said it was a couple of dollars per fan on the ancillary. So, a lot of that is going to be your stadiums and then within the stadiums, the conversation we've been having about really focused on how we price, particularly the front of the house, capture the value to reduce the leakage that goes into the secondary that the artist doesn't benefit from, and that further takes that up; in stadiums, but also that takes place in amphitheatres and arenas.
Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now move on to David Joyce with Evercore ISI.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. In terms of the better pricing of the house, how much further throughout your footprint are you are able to roll out those strategies and learnings?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: I mean, let's leave the theater and clubs separate, but all amphitheater, arena and stadium shows, just given every day that the secondary business is transparent and alive online, is an opportunity for the manager and the promoter and the agent to figure out how to capture more of it. So I would say all – the thematic overall in every conversation we have about a tour or a show with the manager and an agent is how do we make sure we capture more of the marketplace. So, I would say that, we've said it over the last couple of years to slower process because of the fragmented business of a lot of managers and a lot of agents and lot of artists, but overall, thematically every artist, most manager and agent show represents a huge upside potential if they price the house to demand. And we think we have year-after-year, it will grow bit by bit as we increase the Platinum whether its VIP; however, the tool is, but we think most of our shows still have a huge opportunity on the revenue side.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks. And on the Sponsorship and Advertising side, granted you called out the British pounds currency impacts, but are there any regions where the sponsors are stepping up some activity or maybe pulling back that we should be thinking of – and...?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, this is Joe. Not at all. I mean, we call it out in particular Sponsorship side, that's the piece that was really hit by the pound when you look at the different divisions and that's just the – where we have a lot of festivals, so where we have a lot of growth in our Sponsorship business. And that's really all there is to it. Then we're not seeing anything else geographically that would cause us any issues.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. And then just a final housekeeping question for, Kathy. You mentioned after your refinancing the $250 million of extra cash on hand, is that incremental to the $179 million of free cash at the end of the quarter?
Kathy Willard - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yes, it is because that $179 million is as of September and we completed the refinancing at the end of October.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now move on to our next question from Kyle Evans with Stephens.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Hi, thanks. You've made good progress growing your business with the 50-plus brands who spend over $1 million a year with you and you got 95% visibility on that for the year, what is the average length of those contracts and what kind of visibility do you have going into next year? And I've got a follow-up. Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So, if I split Sponsorship from Advertising, Sponsorship is about two-thirds of our business. The majority of those contracts are multi-year, anywhere from two to four years probably on average. And on the online Advertising side it tends to be shorter lead frame, generally within the year. So, across all that you'd expect to enter – by the time you're somewhere in the Q1, you have north of 50% of your revenue booked for the year.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And my follow-up is if you have started telling the fraud free integrated primary, secondary ticketing story to consumers, I have missed it. It sounds very compelling. When do you expect to push that out and get after StubHub? Thanks.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Was it fraud-free? I missed the...
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Well, I guess what I'm saying is you have a unique, because you're on the barcode, you have a better chance that nothing is fraud-free, right?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Right.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: But you have a pretty compelling value proposition to make relative to StubHub on the integrated, and because you can do a better job on the fraud front. I don't feel like you have told that story to consumers yet. First off, am I right? Second off, when will you do that?
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. What I would say is we have not said it in – using TV commercials, broad media approach. I think if you look on sites or you look in some of the e-mail communication we do, absolutely it's been communicated. Clearly, we work with all of our clients and figure out for their fan base is, particularly on the season side what's the right way to communicate with the season ticket holders around where and how they should be selling their tickets. And I think that's going to be more of an organic ramp-up in terms of how we do that. We're not planning on doing it using TV commercials.
Kyle Evans - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried.
Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Hey, congratulations on a great quarter and thank you for taking my question. As I look at concert numbers, international was down a bit by roughly – are you with me? Hello?
Unknown Speaker: Yeah, yeah.
Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. International's down a bit by something like 200 events year-on-year, but attendance is up nicely. So can you explain what's going on there? And are you rationalizing international and positioning for better growth?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: No, no rationalizing. We're growing the business, whether we have some – 200 shows would have most likely be at the lower end club theater style that aren't overly relevant to the revenue, but as far as our core arena business, stadium business over there and bigger theaters continue a aggressive growth mandate as what we've been doing there. And we had a very good year in 2016 growing overall attendance and at our key festivals.
Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks for that.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Hey, Rich, this is Joe. Just again, to repeat the facts as I gave it is, year-to-date through three quarters international fan attendance is up 20% year-on-year, and we've had growth in all building types in terms of fan attendance.
Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. On the ancillaries, how much of that $2 incremental is due to VIP versus merchant services at the lower tier?
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: It would be mostly – most of our business is food and beverage, is where we're going to grow most of our business. And quite honestly, most of it is wet because experientially at a concert one likes to have a beer and other. So, our business and where we focus mostly on is our food and beverage, is where the $2 is mostly coming from and where we think we still have a huge opportunity ahead of us.
Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll now take our final question from Brandon Ross with BTIG Financial Services.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. A couple of questions on ticketing. First, a few weeks back, the SportsBusiness Journal reported that the NFL owners had agreed not to extend their primary ticketing deals past 2017 as they look at new ticketing models for their teams. I think the NFL Ticket Exchange deal is also up at the end of 2017. Are you guys involved in the creation of this new ticketing model? And if not, are you worried the NFL could create their own ticketing company like Major League Baseball did? And then on secondary ticketing, it seems that you meaningfully decelerated in secondary growth in the quarter. I know you said that we'll see a reacceleration in the next quarter, but was there a reason for the deceleration? With more domestic concerts in the quarter, we thought there might be a further acceleration due to primary, secondary integration. And then I have one on the media business after.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: So Brandon, on the NFL, we're very aligned to their process. It's very typical that the leagues, when they're making these decisions, kind of try to rally all of the owners and have a step back, so we're involved. We ticket most of the football stadiums as well as we head a corporate NFL deal on secondary, and we're involved in the process and we will evaluate at the end as we look forward – as the process gets underway, what's best for us and them. But right now we continue to have great conversations and we fill a lot of their stadiums. So I think we'll look at that and we'll know further sometime next year. On the secondary...
Joe Berchtold - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah, yeah, on the secondary, so again just to be clear, Brandon, I didn't just say we'll generally improve in Q4. What I said is, October had an acceleration from Q3. So it's not to come, it actually is what's happened over the past month. Part of what exists for us is if you remember our deals, as you just said with the NFL, with the NBA, and then we tend to have high performance really driven at the concert on sale in the first week of the on sales drives a lot of that integrated secondary activity. And you'll see the 2017 concert on sales much more in Q4 than Q3, so we just have a natural period of much greater activity which will leverage all the fans coming to the Ticketmaster site in Q4 than we had in Q3.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Great. And then just on the media business, especially video. To date you've made smaller investments seemingly to extend your Sponsorship & Advertising business and have mostly used third-party platforms. Do you think there is an opportunity to build a larger media business for you guys with new revenue streams, and do you foresee a continuation of a distributed video strategy or could we see more in the own platform in the future, such as the Live Nation app? Thanks.
Michael Rapino - Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.: Yeah. Brandon, as we've discussed, we think as most people are going through our – that content isn't core to their DNA, publishing to the eyeballs right now is kind of the risk-free version, so we like taking our festivals and our content and publishing them on and selling them through the published arms, whether it's our Snapchat deal with our festivals or selling our Justin Timberlake concert movie to Netflix or the show we sold to HBO on one of our concerts or Facebook Live. So, we think our core business is to take our 26,000 shows, create a great opportunity for advertisers to access 70 million fans onsite, and anyway we can amplify those shows and add more ad units to our portfolio, we think the best model right now is to put those festivals on a Snapchat medium and drive advertising and incremental advertising that way. We always double up and we air our content on LM.com in our app, but like most people are looking to our core is our concerts and the publishing path for us is the way that we can get much better eyeballs and more drive add units right now for our current ad users. If there was a great platform with scale, great, but I don't think you'll see use our balance sheet to try to create an access TV or a concert TV or spend a fortune trying to be destination driven. I think our job is, we're going to make most of our money on 26,000 shows and 70 million people showing up, selling advertisers who want to be part of the onsite and then amplifying onsite through the great publishing strategy where we can also monetize it without having to build the pipe.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, everyone, and this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment third quarter 2016 earnings call. You may now disconnect.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2016 conference call. Live Nation accelerated growth in the second quarter with revenue up 23%, AOI up 28%, free cash flow up 22%. Each of our core businesses concerts, advertising and ticketing contributed to this strong performance with revenue and AOI up double digits in each business. Our concerts business is our flywheel, attracting 19 million fans to shows this quarter, which in turn also drove AOI growth in our ticketing, advertising and on-site businesses. We have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, bringing over 500 million fans in 40 countries to live events each year. With concert ticketing sales running well ahead of last year, we are confident that 2016 will be another record year of results for Live Nation overall and for each of its core divisions. Starting with the concerts business, through mid-July we have sold over 50 million tickets for our concerts that take place this year, pacing 17% ahead of last year this point. As a result, in the second quarter we grew revenue by 26% and AOI by 81% in each our core business. We continue to be the leading promoter in the world, having created a business model that is effective at attracting artists from the club to the stadium level, enabling us to then make money in our high margin on-site, ticketing and advertising businesses. This year we are growing our concerts business across all channels, with an 18% increase in confirmed shows in stadium, arena and amphitheater while also adding more festivals to our portfolio and continuing to expand our club and theater business. This growth is being delivered both in North America and internationally with concerts and festivals projecting mid-to-high single digit growth in fan attendance for the full year. At the same time, we are seeing the benefits from improving the on-site fan experience. For the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in net revenue per fan at our amphitheaters, increasing our contribution margin by over $2 per fan. Coming on top of last year's growth of $0.80 per fan, we are seeing the results from improving our food and beverage offering and expanding our products to provide more options for high-end customers. And our artist management business continued to be strategic to our overall business, providing a strong pipeline of shows and supporting our growth initiatives. In the sponsorship & advertising business, we continued to see strong growth for the quarter with revenue up 17% and AOI up 12%. Live Nation's ongoing success in growing its high margin advertising business is based on its unique scale and breadth in the live experience space. No other advertising platform can match our 60 million on-site engaged fans along with 80 million monthly unique visitors to our websites, and over 500 million direct connections with fans attending events each year. From festivals to branded content to exclusive access to tickets and events, the combined Live Nation concerts and Ticketmaster platforms reached an audience at a level no other music or online company can match. As a result through mid-July contracted net revenue is up 16% and we have sold over 85% of our planned advertising inventory for the year. And because of our platform's unique positioning and demonstrated effectiveness, our Live Nation sponsors continue to renew and expand their commitment to our platform. As of the end of the second quarter, we had roughly 50 sponsors projected to spend over $1 million with us this year, with a cumulative spend growth of 18% to over 200 million for the year. With both sponsorship and online advertising increasing year-on-year, a strong pipeline of committed business, at this point we are confident that we will deliver AOI growth this year consistent with the past several years. Ticketmaster continues to be the leading global ticketing marketplace for the 25 billion in total GTV annually for all of its ticket processed. And after adding five more countries this quarter we offer it in 27 countries worldwide. This quarter we extended our leadership to 14% growth and total GTV of 5.7 billion, an overall Ticketmaster revenue growth of 23% and AOI growth of 20% for the quarter. Our secondary product has delivered GTV growth of over 20% for the ninth consecutive quarter, and it is up 49% year-on-year in the second quarter, to over 300 million. One key component for continuing Ticketmaster's growth is the opening of our marketplace to sell tickets on other distribution platforms, driving increased conversion and tapping into additional fan bases. Through the deployment of APIs with key partners such as Facebook, BandsinTown and Broadway.com, and Groupon we've increased sales by 30% in the first half to more than 5 million tickets. Going forward, we see these and other distribution partners, including teams and artists, as a key way to extend our reach and increase flexibility of our clients and continue selling more tickets powered by Ticketmaster. Underlying this success is the continued expansion of our venue client base. During the quarter, we added nearly 400 new clients globally, making us confident that for the seventh consecutive year we will have a net renewal rate of over 100%. With the TM ONE software platform in full rollout, we are delivering an improved workflow for the venues while at the same time selling more tickets, pricing them better, and reducing Ticketmaster's cost base. As a result of all this, in 2016 we have already had five of the top ten GTV months globally in Ticketmaster's history. As well as Ticketmaster has done this year, I have even greater expectations going forward. Every one of our ticketing verticals has tremendous runway for growth. We now have a technology platform which enables us to deploy web and app products faster and more flexible, and opening our platform is powering even more sales. This, combined with a strengthening value proposition to our growing base of venue clients, positions Ticketmaster for ongoing growth. After our strong performance in the first half of the year, we expect 2016 to be another year of record growth and record results for the company. Based on our key indicators in concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, we expect revenue and AOI growth in each of these businesses and overall for Live Nation this year. With that I'll turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional detail on divisional performance.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue in the second quarter was up 26% and AOI was up 61%. The revenue growth was driven by a 22% increase in attendance for the quarter led by stadium and amphitheater shows. Stadium attendance was six times than in the second quarter of last year with almost 3.5 million fans attending 83 shows in what is shaping up to be our largest stadium year ever. Amphitheater attendance was up 17% to almost 4.5 million fans. And while both North America and international attendance were up double-digits, international growth was particularly strong at 45% for the quarter. And looking forward to the second half as Michael said ticket sales for shows this year are up 17% through July 18th and we've already sold over 50 million tickets for shows this year. Our pipeline of shows in the second half particularly stadiums and arenas that are covering all groups including amphitheater, clubs and theaters and festivals continues to be very strong and we expect to increase our show counts for about 26,000 this year. Given the line of shows are larger venues this year we're confident that we'll deliver high single digit attendance growth for the year. And as Michael also mentioned the success we've had growing per cap profitability at the amphitheaters this year, this growth was led by increased concession sales but also benefiting from higher parking, service charge and merchandise revenue as we continue optimizing revenue per fan. On concession, we worked with legends to improve the overall offer and introduce new concept such as grab and go stands while expanding our high end offers with dedicated wine bars and improved VIP rooms. With this momentum across the Board, we expect continued strong growth in our concerts AOI for the year. At Artist Nation, revenue was flat and AOI improved slightly in the second quarter and we expect similar trends for the full year. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business, ad revenue was up for the second quarter by 17% and AOI grew by 12% continuing its strong performance from the first quarter and growing double digits comping against the very strong growth in the Q2 of last year. The second quarter growth was waged sponsorship this quarter with AOI up 14% driven by new strategic sponsors, increased activity with existing sponsors and increased festival activity. Online advertising is also continuing its steady growth within AOI increase of 7%. At this point with over 275 million in sponsorship and advertising net revenue now contracted for the year, we're confident we will deliver AOI growth consistent with the past few years. Finally, Ticketmaster, for the quarter Ticketmaster revenue was up 23% and AOI up 20%, primary ticketing fee bearing GTV for the quarter was up 20%, strong concerts activity accounted for the majority of our increase in the quarter and growth was strong globally with North America up 26% and international up 5%. Secondary GTV was up 49% for the quarter with growth of 48% in North America and 58% in international markets. The business continues to benefit from our strategy of aligning with content providing fans with their full set of choices with transparency. As a result, we're continuing to see much high conversion rates on integrated inventory events than those with primary only options up now to 50% higher for the first half of this year. And we remain focused on great [ph] rate band product, key amongst these as delivering the best mobile experience for fans. From our continued lab and app improvements, we've increased mobile sales by 47% this quarter year-over-year, now accounting for 27% in overall ticket sales. And given the ticket pipeline and momentum we have in secondary ticketing to the full year, we expect to deliver a high single digit AOI growth with flat year-over-year margin. In summary now more than half ways for the year, we're confident that 2016 will be another year of record top line and bottom line results overall and for each of our core businesses. We also expect record pre-cash flow with AOI conversion into free cash at about the same rate as last year. From a time perspective, we ended up heavier weighted into Q2 from both concerts and ticketing perspective and we thought at the start of the quarter and at this time expect most of our remaining growth for the year to come in the third quarter. On FX during the second quarter, we continue to see a 1% to 2% impact on our revenue and AOI with Q2's impact largely coming from the pound dollar devaluation in the period. If the current forecast of the FX rates hold true, the total FX impact this year would continue in the 1% to 2% for both revenue and AOI. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard: Thanks Joe and good afternoon everyone. I will start with our results for the second quarter. Revenue was up 23% to 2.2 billion and AOI of 28% to 181 million. On a constant-currency basis revenue was 2.2 billion and AOI was 183 million. And free cash flow was 113 million for the quarter, an increase of 22%. Our Concerts deferred revenue for tickets sold for events in the future at our owned or operated venues is one of our most important leading financial indicators. And as of the end of the second quarter, our deferred revenue was 1.2 billion, an increase of 12% over the 1 billion in June of last year. The majority of our revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by significant stadium and amphitheater activity concerts and higher primary and resale volume in ticketing. This growth in concerts and ticketing also largely drove the 28% increase in AOI over last year. Our operating income in the second quarter was 74 million. 76% higher than the 42 million we reported last year driven by the increase in AOI. And our net income for the quarter was 38 million compared to 15 million in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter our other expense included net foreign exchange rate losses from revaluation of 7 million compared to 2015 which included a gain related to acquisitions of 10 million. Moving to the results for the first half of the year, revenue was up 17% to 3.4 billion and AOI up 20% to 254 million. On a constant-currency basis revenue was 3.4 billion and AOI was 257 million. And free cash flow was 123 million, an increase of 5% over last year. The majority of our revenue growth was driven by concerts largely from the increase in the number of stadium shows in North America and Europe as well as strong attendance growth in our amphitheaters. Ticketing revenue for the first half of the year was up from increased primary as well as resale volume. And sponsorship and advertising revenue was 15% as we continue signing new clients, growing our online business and increasing festival sponsorship. The 20% growth in reported AOI for the first half of 2016 was largely from our strong concerts activity and ticketing volume. All of our segments delivered growth in AOI during the first six months. Operating income was 41 million versus 80 million in the first half of 2015 driven by the increase in AOI. And our net loss for the first half was 7 million, an improvement from the net loss of 43 million last year. For the six months our other expense included net foreign exchange rate gains from revaluation of 1 million compared to 2015 which had net foreign exchange rate losses of 21 million. For the full year we currently estimate that we will record 50 million of accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest which impacts the calculation of earnings per share. This accretion is related to certain put/call arrangements from completed acquisitions where the value of the put is recognized over time to APIC. And finally we currently expect the amortization of non-receivable ticketing contract advances for 2016 to be in line with the total amount in 2015. Moving to our balance sheet, as of June 30, we had total cash of 1.5 billion, including 606 million in ticketing client cash and 759 million in net concert event related cash leaving a free cash balance of 148 million. Cash flow from operations was 511 million compared to 362 million in the first half of 2015, with the increase driven by our higher event related deferred revenue and AOI growth. Free cash flow was 123 million in the first half of 2016 as compared to 170 million last year. This increase came from our higher AOI, less increase maintenance CapEx and timing of distributions to our partners. As Joe mentioned, for full your 2015 we currently expect our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI to be similar to what it was in 2015. Our total capital expenditures were 77 million for the first six months with approximately half of that on revenue generating items. We currently expect total capital expenditures to be approximately 175 million to 180 million for the full year in 2016 in line with our previous guidance of about 2% of revenue with about 60% of that overall spend to be spent on revenue generating CapEx. As of June 30th, our total net debt was 2 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. Thank you for joining us today and we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, we will take our first question from John Janedis with Jefferies.
Unidentified Analyst: Martha [ph] on for John. Just wanted to talk about international strategy, you've bought Big Concerts earlier this year and then ticket hour earlier this year, given the scale, do these allow you to enter adjacent countries or regions and are the economics of sport ticketing different outside of the U.S.? Thank you.
Michael Rapino: So the Big Concerts again would just be what we've been doing for many years in the major cities around the world that are now becoming ongoing regular places for big artist to tour, we want to make sure that we have a local office so we can capture all of the revenue and economics when that tour comes to town. So Big Concerts in South Africa or Cape Town, has been the leader forever and one of our partners and now we are able do a deal where we can put our proper base Live Nation business there and now build out the [indiscernible] of ticking and sponsorship. So you'll see that happening over the year, you’ll see that continue to happen where we look for the leading promoter number one or two in that market and then use our scale to accelerate that business and make it an accretive acquisition. Ticket hour is almost an acqui-hire [ph] in the sense, it brought some advanced ticket sport software to our international business same economics over here in America and the servicing obviously the soccer leagues versus the pro sports here. And we were little void in our software in terms of sport over there, so this helped us to plug a whole and provide us a better overall solution for our soccer leagues in Europe.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong: Thanks. Two questions. So first on the revenue per fan contribution, it looks like it more than doubled. Do you think it could double again in the next 12 to 24 months? Where do you think it could go and does it ultimately expand concert margins? And my second question is on this digital opportunities that you have laid out. You now have Yahoo!, Vice, it looks like you are partnering up with Hulu on the VR front and I was just wondering how big you think these deals could be ultimately?
Michael Rapino: I mean on the onsite I mean was not given in the guidance or exact mix here, but I think we've said out loud from our different presentations that we think is going onsite is a huge opportunity. We've been underdeveloped versus kind of the best in the league, we looked at the sports companies and different venues we've showed in the past. So, yes, we think that we have huge opportunity to keep growing our per head revenue business or CM business annually for the next many years to come because we think we'll probably at the lower end on a per head versus most of the sports leagues here in Europe and as we invest in higher end lines, better products, grab and go stores that we have now onsite, better VIP hospitality we're seeing that continually tick in to that $2 that we reported today. So, we think growth will continue for multiple years on onsite CM as we excel our offering. Digital, you and I have talked, Amy, about the digital overall. The digital is just a continual expansion of the ad unit for our business. And the reason we've been able to continually grow our core advertising sponsorship business for the last multiple years is we want to keep offering our sponsors a wide variety of onsite to kind of online offering. So, having more originally I think it was Yahoo! when we started. Having more ways that we're distributing content on a digital basis, from Snapchat to Hulu to VR, using all of the different distribution arms as kind of the publisher of that live experience. We think that it'll be a key foundation of ad unit to keep given our double-digit growth in our core sponsorship advertising business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Bazinet: I just had two questions. Maybe the market is just grasping for things to get excited about as it relates to VR but as a layman, this seems like a very big opportunity, but it seems if I'm interpreting your rhetoric correctly more as just sort of a modest -- not a big monetization driver going forward. I was wondering if you could just explain that because it seems like it could be big, but you don't seem to share that view. My second question is on the $150 million on-site revenue opportunity you guys have cited for the next few years, can you just put a little bit of color around what has to happen? In other words, is it infrastructure that has to get put in your on-site facilities? Is it vendors that need to get swapped out? What is it that is happening behind the scenes that causes that ramp to happen? How much of it is in place today?
Michael Rapino: I think specifically to your VR, listen, we believe at the core why our business is growing and it's going to have a long run way of growth is experiential onsite is the magic. So, the 22 year old that's going to Lollapalooza this weekend or the 52 year old going to Guns N' Roses reunion this weekend is a magical moment and it's much like going on vacation is lot better than watching a video. So, we do believe that the moat around the castle and the most advantaged kind of offering we have is our scale in live and live experiential, on-site where you get the goose bumps, you experience with your friends and make those Kodak moment, has huge opportunity forward for us. Now of course when virtual VR comes, can we do better ways to bringing the guns and roses show to you in your living room in a more dynamic mechanism than a DVD or a current TV? Sure, and we think those will be great ways to distribute that show make it into some content and help us deliver some advertising. But I had not been, even been in big proponent who is going to convince you that anyway we're going to that take Guns and Roses and have a big up sell at home pay per view or selling that to our show, no matter how dynamic it is on its own. I think it is a great content to extent the show first and foremost the biggest advantage to us is it helps us sell more tickets to the later shows and delivers it some advertising reach and scale beyond the onset. So I think it's great, I think it's great for the industry, will be incredible, ad unit, will be incredible way to sell the concert experience. But most of the monetization is always going to be connected to the onsite.
Joe Berchtold: And Jason just to the second point on the $150 million of incremental onsite revenue, again to dimensionalize that there is roughly 30 million fans sending our amphitheaters festivals, theaters and clubs so we're talking about roughly $5 per fan incremental revenue from the numbers that Michael gave you fairly with our amphitheater through the type of products introductions that we've made, we’re well on our way in terms of making progress again that number. And I think he also gave you a feel for the types of products that we need to be rolling out that give you a better experience for everybody on the food and beverage opportunity and then particularly at the high end to the provide VIPs experiences and just some higher end products that can be purchased. So none of these are big capital or big complexity in order to do, but there is just product developments and rollout and iterations against what products are working, which one aren't, taking the lessons that we've gotten from our amphitheater this summary and bringing those to festivals and theaters and clubs to get that overall $150 million number.
Michael Rapino: To finish that up, I would say with our core kind of strategy that needed to be worked on was just a staffing of the skill set. So when we brought over [indiscernible], we kind of created an upper end vision that is focusing on as we kind of call -- we do a good job of getting 70 million into the venue, but just like first calls has come back on airline, we needed to have a decided unit innovatively best can practice thinking about the high end part of the business and bringing better products, creating products packages bundles, travel packages, tequila, et cetera. So first we just have to -- we needed to spend more time on the right skill set and this summer we're very excited about bunch of the program we're testing.
Operator: We'll now go David Joyce with Evercore ISI.
David Joyce: Couple of questions, first, related to your UK exposure, it was late in the second quarter when you had that Brexit surprise. What is that doing to the consumers or the fans from your perspective? The market is roughly 10% of your revenue? And then secondly, if we could discuss kind of what the opportunity is for the Tickethour acquisition. I know you mentioned you get some advance software from that they have but is there any plan as they roll out some of the Ticketmaster products onto what they are doing?
Michael Rapino: So, on the first on the UK exposure we've seen zero impact on fan demand in the UK as it relates to the Brexit or any of those concerned. So, absolutely none and yes all of that happened late in the second quarter. But even our forward rates as I mentioned which show roughly flat to bit of decline in the pound still has us at the 1% to 2% for the year. So, we're not seeing anything in terms of either the demand or the translation economics that has us concerned at this point. In terms of Tickethour a 100% the plan is that the Tickethour is integrated into our European Ticketmaster operations and it is the backbone that serves the soccer, rugby and other major sports league through Europe. Again the counterpart to what we have in the U.S. that would serve football, basketball, hockey and so on. So, yes it is to be integrated within Ticketmaster.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Doug Arthur with Huber Research.
Doug Arthur: Joe, you had such a blowout in the concert division in the second quarter and you made a comment that some of that may have stolen from the third quarter. I'm just trying to get a handle on your sense of momentum in the seasonally biggest quarter of the year. I mean obviously it is not going to be up 26% I assume on the top line. But is the pipeline still fairly robust going into the third quarter? I am just trying to get a better sense of what is going on.
Joe Berchtold: 100%, we expect third quarter to be very strong, record third quarter for us. I think we simply just saw even part of it was Ticketmaster on sale timing even stronger in Q2 than we expected and part of it is just some of our show timing. So, nothing that would be a lost momentum going into Q3, you can tell from some of our numbers that where we're at today in terms of sold versus the guidance we gave you on where we end up. But yes, still a very strong third quarter.
Doug Arthur: And just as a corollary, I mean historically there has been some linkage between strong touring activities in Artist Nation at least on the merchandise side and I know the business model there has changed. But how come Artist Nation can't kind of kick into gear here?
Michael Rapino: It's really just I mean -- frankly in part a timing issue and when different tours are out as we saw bit of improvement this quarter, we'll see a bit more improvement we think continuing but it's not a scale business like our businesses are scale businesses, it's job shop business. So, when you make some of these improvements in the amphitheater and you have that then rolled out to 15 million people, we just see a very different scale of impact than you see in a job shop type environment.
Operator: We'll go now to John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John Healy: Joe, I just wanted to kind of ask a question about the outlook that you guys provided. When I look at the commentary regarding the outlook for the concert business I think previously in the supplemental you were talking to double-digit growth in concert AOI and the verbiage changed a little bit. I don't want to be too nitpicky but was just wondering compared to what you felt about the concert business three months ago, has your outlook gotten or better, stayed the same, gotten a little bit worse? Just trying to understand the overall feel on the back of the strong 2Q that you had?
Joe Berchtold: I think the overall feel is very optimist, very positive, feel better now than we did three year months, it's been a very great Q2 and we expect the great Q3.
John Healy: Okay. Great, and I just wanted to ask on the Artist Nation side of things, you talked a couple of quarters ago about getting a little bit more visible on the sports side of the business. I was just kind of curious to know how that initiative is progressing and with that initiative, is that one of the reasons we are not maybe seeing the Artist Nation AOI kind of pick up? Is there a decent amount of spend there? I'm just trying to understand a little bit more just what is going on with the cost structure there?
Joe Berchtold: It's going very well in terms of the Artists that are being signed and we’ve had some great successes some of the headlines clients like the Kevin Durants. It is not a cheap business to enter and the economics do come overtime in that one. So absolutely that would be a piece of what would be muting some of the overall Artists Nation performance.
Operator: And we'll take question from Rich Tullo from AFCO.
Rich Tullo: Congratulations on the quarter, it looks like things are really humming in the concert industry. In terms of geopolitical, it doesn't look like you are seeing any influence by what is going on. Is that the case or is it the U.S. is just very robust right now?
Michael Rapino: I think you're right Rich, at this point, we are seeing very robust demands still globally, it's been various events going on around the world on a political and otherwise standpoint, but thus far we haven't seen any impact on our demand, current show, shows down the road of the on sale and really nothing that we can discern.
Rich Tullo: And then by genre, is there anything moving the bar and taking over from something that was strong last year just to get a feel for how it is going?
Michael Rapino: Our philosophy is that we believe we're operating a level. We're going to be number one in all of the genre and our other markets we operate in across all types of buildings. So we haven't any major shifts in genre, we continue to see a very wide set of genres continuing to have strong demand from EDM to country to pop to hip hop to classic rock, but really nothing that has shifted dramatically recently.
Rich Tullo: And then in terms of digital, how should we be looking at the opportunity set over the next couple of years? Is it the same type of opportunity set with partnerships with groups such as Vice and Yahoo which is now part of Verizon or do you think that there is something else to do?
Michael Rapino: We think we've making strong measured progress in our mission. Our mission is, we have 25,000 shows in all of these festivals occurring, can you create content and distribute it and publish it to the growing distribution platforms, one to drive your core business and two to achieve some new ad units. And we think we've been making great progress with lots of different partners, we'll continue to see announcements that say we're going to stream these 20 shows on this platform or do VR on that platform or create some behind the scenes document commentary on online to Facebook's, to Twitter's etc. So, I think you'll see more the same I think the progress was made is that we're very credible now with most distributors. Most distributors want to meet with us and talk about can we bring that great live content to our platform with either being a live stream or behind the scenes or live documentaries or artist interviews, access behind the scenes at festivals. So, I think we've been moving very nicely and we're very pleased with our progress and we'll continue to do more content on platforms and drive more advertising.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Ben Mogil with Stifel.
Ben Mogil: So one on the business and one on the numbers. On the business, given some of the geopolitical issues that are going on out there, are you seeing any kind of change in insurance costs at the venues that you either own or operate, are you seeing any kind of need for greater staffing? I'm kind of curious if you are seeing that change at this point in time?
Joe Berchtold: This is Joe. First of all in terms of the insurance that's all down the road, if anything certainly we've got our policies in place now for this year and haven't seen changes for this year, but that's all to be determined. In terms of our security it’s certainly a priority for us as we think about our fans and our staff and our artists and making sure we've got the right security in place. So, it's been a bigger area of focus. We obviously don't talk a lot about the specifics but certainly it's getting a lot more attention today than it did a year ago. And I think that you'll see various changes to the experience that will hopefully not be dramatic for the fans going to show, but we'll give everybody comfort that we're doing reasonable steps to protect everybody.
Michael Rapino: And then just to jump on that I always like to remind people that there is a vast majority of shows we promote not in our venues. So, there's difference between when we own the amphitheater or festival and our internal security protocols and how we make sure we have metal detectors and et cetera, versus when we're promoting a show at someone else's venue. We have lots of the -- if you want to call it the security capital risk cost associated with that. So, a majority of the shows, the high percentage of the 25,000 shows are not within our venue network. So, we've two very different kind of strategies, one you can control and one you can't.
Ben Mogil: But as you sort of go forward, is sort of how good or not good the venues ground security will be a bigger choice for you about whether to play that particular venue if you have got choices in the market kind of thing?
Michael Rapino: I think we'll have -- venues will continue to elevate. We see lots of them doing a good job, but the good news is that's not our cost to bare and it's just our charge to decide where to put the artist.
Ben Mogil: And then on the numbers, so very good revenue growth at ticketing, but a bit of margin compression. Was there anything in the quarter either in the mix or anything that you wanted to call out about that?
Joe Berchtold: Well, as in just a mix and timing issue and we called out that we expect flat margins for the full year. So, that -- you can expect then it'll come back over next few quarters.
Operator: And we'll now take the question from Brandon Ross with BTIG.
Brandon Ross: Thank you for taking the questions. A couple of questions. One on margins in general and I guess Ben brought this up in the last question, but with the ticketing and sponsorship top lines growing so-so much this quarter, why aren't you seeing more leverage at each of them even with the couple of subscale ticketing platforms that you purchased? And then secondly, I know you had originally expected all the international ticketing would be on one platform by now. When should we expect that and to catch up to the work you have done in ticketing in the U.S. internationally and is this critical to your scaling into new international markets? Thank you very much.
Michael Rapino: I'll answer the second first on the backward, on our international ticketing, we actually have the most important market in international the UK and Australia and Canada. They are all -- have always been and are on the close platform, so they are on the business and that's where at the end of the day most of our business is centered and where we want to share and extrapolate all of our cost and product development. When you get to decision like staying, where you're running a separate platform over to the very small piece of your business those urgency to take get on one platform are not on our list right now, they're running local currency. Most of the Europeans are on still retail system where you're buying tickets at the bank or the shopping mall a very retail oriented, not years behind kind of where we're today. So our priority has always has been the big markets like the UK, Canada, Australia to leverage our product development which we have been doing. We've had great growth in the UK over the last few years. And most important what was the priority was to make sure we excel the secondary in the European markets, unlike Ticketmaster in its prior life who waited too long and they have to play catch up. So our biggest priority in international was when we acquired Seatwave and with our GetMe product which integrates secondary and now 9 plus countries where we're now the market leader in the secondary business over there and are very proud of that. So our strategy is in the big markets internationally. They are sharing product innovation and underlying to our current strategy around primary and secondary. The slower markets overtime will look to integrate them into global platform, but those will be minimal upside from a cost advantage in the near term.
Brandon Ross: What about new markets? Sorry to cut you off, Joe. What about moving into new markets? What is the strategy for that and does any of the re-platforming work that you have to do internationally play a role in that?
Michael Rapino: I mean international is like concert business. You only -- right now international is always going to be one or two people that are already the leaders. So you may acquire somebody not because you're so much interested in their platform, but you just acquiring the cost of the contracts and the customers. So historically when we have looked into extension, we may acquire a company just if that's the quickest way to get scale and ticket inventory. We can rollout -- our current platform, we can rollout into a new market today. We don’t typically tough right now look at a new market and enter with our new platform if we don't have tickets scale behind it. So, our short term strategy in international when we took over and continued to be -- Ticketmaster was in, I think when we took over ’14-’15 markets. Our goal was to get into the European markets where we had scale and start matching up concerts, inventory with Ticketmaster platform and then step two grow market share in those markets and that's where we've been and that's where we'll see the fruit kind of bear from the tree for the next few years on growing our market share in Spain and Italy and France and Germany, where we have already got content versus obsessing whether we're in a new market or not right now.
Brandon Ross: Great and then on the margins?
Joe Berchtold: So, first off, just as a reminder as we've talked in the past, our number one obsession is driving the cash generation of the business and delving [ph] how much we're generating for our shareholders. We obviously pay attention to margins and focus on return on capital, but number one is the cash generation for the machine we have. So, I think the two business is on the sponsorship side again strong double-digit growth this year against 25% growth in Q2 last year. So comping on a very difficult comp. A couple of things, we drove a good chunk of that growth. One was an expansion of branded content creation by that division. So, we are working with brands, sponsors and a good chunk of what we're doing is creating content that is their brand integrated into it. That is a lower margin sponsorship product. Still very profitable for us but lower margin. Another piece of activity that we have in Q2 that we've been building over the course of the past year is with our festivals in addition to our payment for sponsorship is not providing activation onsite for additional payment from our sponsors. Again this is a lower margin activity because we've got the feet on the street that are doing the activation, but remains very profitable for us. So, that took a couple of points off the sponsorship business. Again stay mid to high 60s margin business for the growing cash generation. On the ticketing side first of all as I said to Ben part of it is timing, and the other part of it is we have discussed before is that while the traditional was host, now Jetsam [ph] chunk of our business is improved, economics, improve margin, there are a number of other specialty verticals that we've been in that tend for various reasons to have a lower margin profile as those grow faster than the traditional business that just has a counter balance for the margins that we've seen improved with Jetsam. All of which has led to substantial cash improvement at Ticketmaster, but doesn't come through in the margin specifically.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session and this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Live Nation has continued growing its business in 2016, with first quarter revenue up 10% and AOI up 7% on constant-currency basis. With strong operating performance across all three divisions, our Concerts, Advertising and Ticketing business. More importantly four months into the year we have enough information from leading indicators to be confident that we are on track to deliver record top line and bottom line results in 2016 as we continue building global market share in all our businesses. We have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, connecting over 500 million fans to that magical two-hour event each year. Concerts continue to be the flywheel for our high-margin On-Site Retail, Advertising, and Ticketing segments, and this year will be another step forward in the company delivering strong long-term growth. Starting with our concerts business, ticket sales are pacing 10% ahead of last year through April 29, with over 35 million tickets already sold. We continue to be the world's leading promoter with 21 of the top 25 global tours in 2016, including Beyoncé, Coldplay, Guns N' Roses, Rihanna and Drake, driving a 13% increase in stadium, arena and amphitheater shows for the year, as of the end of April. Festivals continue to have a strong appeal for fans, artists and advertisers, and we are continue to build on our leadership position with 78 festivals with 7 million fans attending. We see continued growth in festivals across the globe in both large and niche size, with many markets still under-serviced. Along with attendance growth, we also expect to continue growing on high-margin on-site revenue this year as we continue to rollout new tech-powered product offerings at both amphitheaters and festivals. Such items as ordering from your seats at the amphitheater from your app, to expanded cashless ordering at our festivals. And at the same time, we are expanding our global footprint, most recently adding South Africa as the 37th country we promote in, and our acquisition of Founders Entertainment which builds our presence in New York and adds Governors Ball to our festival portfolio. Our Artist Nation division continues to attract managers organically and through targeted acquisitions that continues to feed our core businesses. The Sponsorship & Advertising business continued its strong growth in the first quarter, with revenue up 13%, AOI up 9% on a constant currency. Through April, we have sold over 70% of our expected advertising for the year, positioning us for another year of double-digit growth. Our contracted online advertising is up 14% through April as we further leverage our ability to integrate ticket-buying customer data to create more targeted profile, leading to increased effectiveness of digital buys in music. And our contracted sponsorship is up 10% through April as more brands see the value from our scale platform of over 60 million fans as an effective way to directly connect with their customers. Ticketmaster continued to build its global marketplace in the first quarter, increasing GTV by 18% at constant currency. This growth was led by continued strength in our secondary ticketing business, with GTV up 43% at constant currency, making this quarter the eighth consecutive quarter with growth over 20% in secondary GTV. Primary ticketing GTV grew by 16% for the quarter at constant currency. The month of February was the largest ever at Ticketmaster, selling over 17 million tickets globally, and during the quarter we had five of the top 20 days in the history of Ticketmaster. Over the past year, we have reinforced our position as the top global ticketing partner for venues and content, adding over 150 new clients to our strong venue base of 12,000. On the product side, one of our main areas of focus continues to be delivering a great mobile experience for fans buying at Ticketmaster. At this point, our websites are largely mobile response ready, and we have continued to upgrade our iOS and Android apps. As a result, we have increased our mobile ticketing sales by 30% year-on-year, now accounting for over 25% of all ticket sales. During the first quarter we also made huge strides in realizing our vision of an open API marketplace. We launched our full – our first fully functional API with Bandsintown, enabling fans to directly search Ticketmaster's inventory and buy tickets without leaving Bandsintown app. This week we are launching the same functionality with Facebook, both with their app and online, and expect to rapidly scale from there. While still early, initial results show strong conversion and uplift in incremental sales. With Ticketmaster off to a great start over the first four months in 2016, we expect to continue profit growth trend of the past several years, and continued opportunity for years to come. Overall, 2016 is on track to be another record year of growth and record results for the company. All the leading indicators for our concerts, sponsorship and ticketing businesses are performing ahead of last year's record year, as we expect each of these businesses to deliver revenue, AOI and free cash flow growth this year. Our results are demonstrating the fundamental strength and growth of the live entertainment space and Live Nation's positioning to deliver long-term profit and cash flow growth. Now over to Joe Berchtold to take you through more details in the divisions.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue was up 12% on a constant currency basis, and AOI was down due to show mix, notably lower arena activity in North America. Given Q1 is traditionally our slowest quarter for concert activity, what matters most at this point of the year is our pipeline of shows and tickets sold to-date for shows this year. Our show count for the year is tracking toward a mid-single digit growth rate, with double digit growth in our core arena, amphitheater and stadium shows. This growth is particularly strong internationally this year, where we expect over 20% growth in arena and stadium shows, and given the strong show count growth, particularly in our larger venues, we expect high single-digit growth in fan attendance for the year, and based on this, we expect to deliver double-digit AOI growth in Concert segment for the year, with a particularly strong third quarter. At Artist Nation, revenue is essentially flat while AOI showed slight improvement. Similar to Concerts, the first quarter is typically our lowest activity, so what matters more is our pipeline for the rest of the year, and based on what we see now, we expect a strong Q2 and Q3 for the business, with Q2 back to profitability, and for the full year growing AOI at double-digit rates. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, revenue in constant currency grew by 13%, and AOI grew by 9% for the first quarter. Here again, over 85% of our AOI is typically in the second quarter through fourth quarters. So, it is our confirmed sales pipeline that is our key leading indicator, and the pipelines for both sponsorship and online advertising are looking strong. In sponsorship, the growth is particularly coming from North America, since we have added several new multi-million dollar strategic partnerships and also continue to see strong growth in our festival sponsorship. With online advertising, we're seeing double-digit growth in contracted sales for both North America and international as we further leverage our database of consumer spending on live events and tie that to targeted online ad placement. Based on commitments to-date and our strong pipeline, we expect to deliver AOI growth for Sponsorship & Advertising consistent with the past several years. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, revenue in constant currency was up 10% and AOI was up 6%. Primary ticketing fee-bearing GTV was up 16% to $2.8 billion at constant currency for the quarter. Over half of this growth came from the Concerts segment with most of the rest coming from sports and arts. And this primary growth was consistently strong globally with North America GTV up 10% and international GTV up 29%. In secondary ticketing, GTV increased by 43% for the quarter with 40% plus growth in each North America and internationally. In North America, this growth was largely from our TM+ integrated inventory product which drove most of our increased GTV in the quarter. And as we scale Ticketmaster and add additional targeted verticals, we also remain focused on the cost structure of our operating model. After delivering our planned cost per ticket savings over the past three years, we will extract further savings in our core business this year. This combined with the higher growth rate of lower scale secondary festival and do-it-yourself businesses, we expect we'll deliver stable margins for the overall division for the year. For the full year, we expect the amortization of non-recoupable ticketing advances to be flat to last year, and when adjusted for purchase price accounting largely flat since 2013, as we expect to drive 20% plus growth in both revenue and AOI over that same period. Taken together, we expect to deliver mid to high single digit AOI growth in ticketing this year. And in summary, four months into the year, given the strength in all of our leading indicators, we feel confident we will deliver another record result in 2016. Looking at seasonality, we expect Q2 to deliver AOI at roughly the same percentage of full year AOI as last year. And on FX, we saw a 1% to 2% impact on the business in Q1 and, based on rates today, expect Q2 to be about the same. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Joe. And good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2016: our revenue is up 10% to $1.2 billion and AOI is up 7% to $74 million, both at constant currency. As reported, revenue is $1.2 billion and AOI is $73 million, and free cash flow is $10 million for the quarter. Our Concerts deferred revenue for tickets sold for events in the future at our owned or operated venues is one of our most important leading financial indicators. And as of the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue was $1.2 billion, an increase of 29% over the balance in March of last year of $919 million. The majority of our revenue growth in the first quarter to $1.2 billion was driven by concerts and ticketing. Concerts had increased international activity, largely in Australia and Asia, and we also had more shows in our theaters and clubs business. Ticketing revenue growth was driven by higher resale GTV in both sports and concerts, and we also had higher primary ticket sales globally. Reported AOI for the first quarter was $73 million, up 5% over last year, largely due to the increased primary and secondary ticketing activity. Our operating loss in the first quarter was $33 million. This loss is higher than the $24 million operating loss last year, largely due to higher acquisition-related intangibles impact in 2016. And our net loss for the quarter was $45 million, an improvement from the net loss of $58 million in the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to net foreign exchange rate gains of $8 million from revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets. We currently estimate that we will record approximately $45 million of accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest during 2016, based on our current asset base, which impacts the calculation of earnings per share. This is related to certain of our put/call arrangements in acquisitions where the value of the put is recognized over time to APIC (13:55). Moving to our key balance sheet items, as of March 31, we had total cash of $1.7 billion, including $663 million in ticketing client cash and $758 million in net concert event related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $278 million. Cash flow from operations was $517 million compared to $348 million in the first quarter of 2015, with the increase driven from our higher event related deferred revenue. Free cash flow was $10 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $25 million last year. As we often don't buy 100% in an acquisition to keep our entrepreneurial partners motivated, we will make distributions to our partners at different times in the year and the payments will vary from quarter to quarter. These distributions were higher in the first quarter of 2016, which impacted free cash flow for the quarter. For full year 2016, we expect our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI to be higher than 2015. Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $25 million, with maintenance CapEx of $14 million and revenue generating CapEx of $10 million. We currently expect total capital expenditures of approximately $170 million to $175 million for the full year 2016, with about 60% of that to be spent on revenue generating CapEx. As of March 31, our total net debt was $2 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. We are comfortably in compliance with our debt covenant that requires a maximum leverage ratio of 4.75 times. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will take our first question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you, and congrats on another great quarter. So, two questions, first, on digital initiatives and the second question is on Ticketmaster. Can you update us on how your digital initiatives are going, particularly the one with Vice? What's been the feedback from consumers, and how big do you think this ad opportunity could be? And my second question is on some of the cost savings for Ticketmaster longer-term. I know, you're calling for stable margins this year, but perhaps if you can talk about some of the margin expansion opportunities going forward, that would be great? Thank you.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Amy. It's Michael. I'll take the first one, and Joe will talk to second. Digital, I assume you meant the video content we're producing? So we're going to be flying tonight – or tomorrow we're going to go and we'll be at the New Front in front of a bunch of advertisers, taking them through our portfolio of content. So the thesis is simple. We have 25,000 shows, 85 or 78 festivals that we own. There's lots of great social content happening from all of those great events. We have 900 advertisers, and over the last couple years, obviously those 900 advertisers would say to you we'd love to buy some advertising, we love to buy sponsorship, we wish you had some content, some video from these great events. So that's when we started, whether it was Yahoo! for proof-of-concept, Vice as a producing partner. We hired a great executive internally, Heather Parry, who was at MTV for years. And we're about to announce some other distributor deals, what we've been able to build and create, whether it's live streaming those 25,000 shows or shoulder content around the live experience, live from the festival, backstage, interviews, all the ways that you would expect. So, we're very happy that we've been walking slowly, self-funding it through advertising, building a roster. We have over I think 80 pieces of content from our Vice original series. We've now streamed 400 to 500 shows. We're publishing that in lots of places, whether it's Snapchat for festivals or whether it's Facebook and others. So we're very happy that we have a very strong internal skillset and partners now that can help us create great content from our business, publish that, whether it's for brands or whether it's published across all of the forms where the fans are, and adding an ad unit to our roster of ad units that our 900 sponsors now can also purchase while they're buying a sponsorship, a digital advertising or a deeper content ad unit. So we're going to talk about it more tomorrow at our New Front, and talk about, kind of, our wider portfolio of partners, but we think it's an incredibly important piece to our overall mission. We said three years ago that we would double advertising, that it would be one of our largest, highest margin growth opportunities, we still have been very bullish to tell you that over the next three years we think we can continue to double that business. We think it's going to be the biggest high margin piece of our growth story. It's fed from our concerts and our ticketing database, and we think having video content of a live concert has to be a fundamental ad unit in our roster of ad units. And that will be one component to how we keep growing double digit over the next two years to three years.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Amy, this is Joe. On the Ticketmaster question, I think as you know, our primary obsession is continuing to drive Ticketmaster's global market share in ticketing, which then in turn drives the top line of that business, the AOI and the cash generation. So we've talked a lot lately about how we're expanding in secondary and festival and do it yourself; all businesses that have lower scale, and therefore not yet their margin maturity of the core Ticketmaster business. So as we take cost out of that core traditional Ticketmaster business, there is some offset with the margin mix in terms of where the growth is going to come from? And we're going to continue to be obsessed at looking at every additional vertical, looking at new markets to go into, expanding our position internationally, both in the core business as well as in those different verticals. So we're going to be very focused on managing the cost structure and operating model of our traditional business as we get more and more technology out there and more self-serve with it, which will let us lower the cost of that. But I think as you look at the division overall for the next several years, again what you'll see, our focus has been is growing the topline AOI and cash flow from building the business, much more than anything else.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Michael, I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the success you had in some of the pilots last year with some of the onsite ways to reach the customer and get them to spend more, sounds like you're rolling that out to even more venues this year. Is there any color you can give us on, kind of, the numbers behind it? What sort of success you had last year? And how big this initiative in terms of rollout will be in 2016?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And you're talking about our on-site pilots?
John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Exactly.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Well, we always like to highlight it because quite honestly it's one of those core businesses that we do that don't really get the focus. Most people talk about the ticket sale, and what we're really always been about is the per-head spend, right. That's why we're more interested in getting you in the venue and then figuring out how to make our $15 to $20 per head, whether it's in our venue or someone else's. So we've been, year after year, growing our on-site per head business. And one of the roadblocks over the last five years was when we would be able to really get the Wi-Fi connection and at what cost that would come at. And we waited, we didn't – five years ago, we looked at it, and four years ago, and the CapEx cost to make sure our theaters, our clubs, our amphitheaters and our festivals had really great Wi-Fi, it was too cap intensive, so we knew that would come down. We're at that position now where we've been able to strike a great deal with Cisco in terms of getting our amps and our venues Wi-Fied. It's going to be a great sponsorship relationship with them, as we go deeper with Cisco. And it's going to be a positive revenue business for us, so we can have that Wi-Fi installed now at our venues, and we start to make money day one from both sponsorship and then selling on-site, advertising in the app, upgrading your seat, selling you food and beverage. So last year, we piloted it with our app, instant delivery to your seat, order from your seat, express lanes. And we had to get the pieces of plumbing in place. We had Legends last year, our new provider, who was much more innovative, or able to deliver us this unique experience. We had to get the Wi-Fi provider. We spent the last six months reviewing all options and picked Cisco. And this summer, we will have that rolled out across 20 of our amphitheaters, a lot of our festivals. And our initial results continue to say that it is a great way to add $1 or $2 per head when you have the business and that opportunity of those new products presented to that fan on-site. So if you look at our core festival business, you can start seeing over the next two years to three years one of the great growth movers is going to be looking at how many customers walk in our venue and getting a closer Disneyland gap, as we've said in our assessment before, moving us one step forward towards the major league baseball – the leaders in sports, and the Disneylands – on getting us closer to $20-$25 per head. And this time, we think we'll have some great bottom line results in our Concert division, and those continue to scale over the next few years.
John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Thank you for that. I wanted to ask a big picture question to you and the team. If I think about the phase of each of your businesses right now, you guys have spent a lot of time and a lot of money kind of recalibrating them, and kind of getting them on a new path, and they're all doing really well right now. So if I think about kind of the next three years – if I think about technology, if I think about content, and if I think about, even the things like the Roc Nation sports deal that you guys have been doing, how do you – what – how would you prioritize the business units in terms of capital spend and investment right now?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think, if you look at where we're going to spend our dollars, I mean, one of the realities is – most of our growth has still been organic. So, I forget the latest percentage we said out loud, Joe.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: But it's, yeah, I mean, 90%-plus of our AOI this year is organic. And the vast, vast majority of our growth, year-on-year, is organic.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Organic. So, just to state, the business and the execution is why the cash flow and AOI has been growing, not the bolt-on acquisitions over the last three years. So we continue to think we got lots of room to execute better, and continue to have record years for the next years to come. In terms of, then capital allocation of resources – fundamentally, number one, is to continue to make sure we consolidate and scale our global concert business. Because the number one competitive advantage we have in the world is, we have 73 million customers walking in our door, and we're providing 1,500 artists an year, an incredible platform to get on the road and tour. That is the part that is very hard to replicate. And we're going to make sure that that continues to grow, because we think there's lots of great global opportunities. So that's why you see us do most of our M&A there, on a global basis, because we still think those are really accretive opportunities. When you buy a Gov Ball, who's been on Eventbrite ticketing, you over – now, you make it a Ticketmaster opportunity. You add sponsors, because they were under-serviced – and overnight, you've got a very accretive business. So you'll continue to see us making sure that we build our global business. That is our competitive advantage. From that, that feeds our higher-margin ticketing business, helps us either renew clients, find new clients or proof of concept, lets us sell to other clients who see what we're doing with our business. We don't need to do as much M&A on Ticketmaster. It's been more of a fixed cost, get the right engineers in, keep the team competitive, upgrade the team, make sure we got the quality team that can build. One of the real advantages we don't really mention is now that the platform is in place, the real benefit is being able to do an API for Facebook – with a very small team and a quick timeline, but you can build that product now. That was unobtainable with legacy TM. So a lot of the plumbing that's been invested in is going to let us continually just keep building good products that we can roll out fast to meet the market opportunity. We'll continually – we look internationally at M&A for ticketing. We tend to still find most of them over-valued. We believe that our platform in international and the U.S. are world class and we'll continue to add clients to the platforms versus probably spend any high multiples for ticketing M&A around the world. But we do review them and if we think there's a good ticketing company that can help us advance our global strategy, we'll look at it. But usually our platform with more content and concerts in a market helps us get there. And then sponsorships ends up being, again, mostly a people business. If we have the right festivals, the right assets and the right digital pieces, then our ad team can continue to create better value for our clients. So we have a complicated model, but it's really simple. The more people that walk in the door and the more concerts we put on, means the more tickets we sell, the bigger our fan base is, which means we have more advertising opportunity.
John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Got you. Thank you, guys.
Operator: We'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. I just had one question. You said your priority was to consolidate and scale the Global business and I was just wondering if you could take a second and share with us anything that you see evolving or developing on the competitive front in terms of other players out in the marketplace trying to mimic what you're trying to build?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thank you. Listen, I think one of the smartest things we've done for 10 years is have a very small to-do list and a big don't-do list. I think the reason we can sit here 10 years later with 70 million customers going to our shows and be a clear global leader is because we stayed to our knitting. We started in the same time, 10 years ago, with our competitors. We were all the same size. Some of them decided to – I don't know – go after NFL teams and et cetera. We stayed core to our business and that's why 10 years later we are the best in the world at what we do. We've attracted the best talent and we're going to keep making sure that we don't leave any opportunity to lose our position. I think the competitive set is probably more obviously in the ticketing space. You'll always see somebody with a new app or somebody's desire to try to replicate the TM model. Again, we think the combination of having Live Nation's content feeding Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster's incredible global position and scale around its commerce, and really, the reality of our real focus over the last three years to get the best talent in the world reengaged at Ticketmaster. When we took over Ticketmaster, we couldn't hire somebody from Amazon or Apple. We couldn't hire the best-in-class. Today, we can hire the best-in-class every day of the week, who understand now Ticketmaster is a revived new spirit with a great mission. Great technology people want great missions. We have a great mission at Ticketmaster: to evolve and become even better at helping the customer find a ticket and get to the show. And I think that's the place that's the most competitive. We see it when we're re-signing (31:49) clients. And we see it on the consumer front. So, I think if we continue to invest in great products and always continue to never lose sight of our core business, which is the more concerts we have, the more we can control and leverage our ecosystem, we're confident we can continue to grow all three businesses.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Maybe if I can just ask one follow-up, if someone like Stubhub in the secondary ticket market sort of went backwards and tried to acquire someone in the primary ticket market to replicate the model that you have, would you characterize that as a meaningful challenge? Or given the primary ticketing assets that are out there, sort of not that meaningful?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, every action has a reaction. We assumed when we went from primary to adding secondary on our seat map that everybody scurried at Stubhub headquarters, and it's taken them this long to go, oh, crap, we better add primary to our seat map. So we predicted that was coming. I think I've said out loud many times that we welcome secondary and primary merging together. We think we're the beneficiary of that over time. So, we like the idea over time that there is one place to buy a ticket to the Beyoncé show versus historically, there was a primary provider, who wasn't working with all of the same tools of secondary. So we think secondary – we think Stubhub has always been our main competitor in the U.S. It's not around the world. We like to remind everyone we have a global business in Ticketmaster. We're really growing strong throughout Europe. We're number one in secondary in most of the markets in Europe where Stubhub was late to the market, so we made sure that we didn't sit tight over in Europe, that we launched and are the leader now in most of the markets that we participate in. So, we're very confident that globally there is some regional players but we're the only global platform. And we assumed secondary providers will try to add some primary. And I think that does one great thing for us, the more we can convince – so think of what our biggest challenge to growth is, convincing primary to add secondary to the equation. So, letting the primary provider, when you meet with them, convincing them that it's okay to put primary and secondary at one offering for the fan, and I think every time that the market goes towards that, we win, because our client, the team, the artist, the more they get comfortable with seeing primary and secondary together, our market share grows.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Understood. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. I have just a couple of things. You mentioned that you've got 37 countries in which you have promotional activity. How many of those do you have ticketing at this point?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: We have ticketing in 22 countries. It's not 100% overlapped, but it's probably 20 out of the 22 we have ticketing in, we do concerts in. So it's about 40 overall countries, and ticketing about half of them.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. And you mentioned some new strategic sponsors that came in recently. Could you talk about how broad your activities are with them, anything interesting to drive the business model going forward? Are they multi-national in nature? What kind of duration do those have?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. No, they tend to be multi-year and multi-millions of dollars global deals. We haven't announced all of them yet, which is why we haven't given you the exact details, but they tend to be new categories for us. A lot in the technology space we're finding is looking for ways to reach that millennial audience, and is finding our platform attractive for that. In our sponsorship group, one of the things that we've been doing over the past year is really ramping up category specialists. So, whereas traditionally, you had some core categories of your beer and consumer goods, obviously, financial services, automotive, we've hired a number of experts that understand in greater detail the business models of different segments, which lets us then go in on a more informed basis into the CMOs office at those companies, engage them on how the Live Nation platform of 63 million fans can deliver them some real value. And several of those have been coming to fruition here over the past few months.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: And you had also mentioned, about 25% of your ticketing now is done on mobile. Could you talk about your outlook for the evolution of going to new paperless ticketing throughout the industry?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. I mean I think our view is that the ticket is an ideal product to be on your phone. And it's really a matter of the adoption curve, which is impossible to exactly predict, but it is an eminently logical thing to be purchased on the phone, found on the phone, transferred to your friends, sold, used to get in. So, there is a number of things that we don't control on the consumer adoption curve, but we've been working hard with venues to make sure that they've got the ability to read those tickets when you show up with them. Obviously, there is a lot of things around, just people's use of the phones, and battery life and so on, but absolutely expect that to continue to grow, as how the millennial wants to interact to get there and manage their information.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: How should we think about the kind of investment that would be required on that? How would you share that with the venues? What efficiencies do you get out of going paperless?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: So, I think in most of our ticketing venue deals right now, we're very much involved in the access control point, because we need to provide something that gets the person a ticket. I think that what it does, it ultimately just creates a much better fan experience. It increases conversion because the search and purchase process are easier, and it increases the certainty because there is no longer fake tickets when it's a digital right that is being transferred around. So I think it can move to a much more fan-friendly system, and better for the venues, better for content as well.
David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Please go ahead.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Thanks. Two questions on ticketing. First on, we've kind of beaten this around a little bit, but on the cost side, the 11% growth in direct operating costs in the quarter, is that primarily driven by royalties in the resale market, or international expansion or both? Then I've got a follow-up with Ticketmaster.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. It's going to be made up of all of the above. It's going to be made up in the royalty rates, both North America and internationally, mixed with our secondary business and just general higher operating costs as we continue to build the global teams.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then, Michael, you talked about landing another 150 venues in the quarter to Ticketmaster. How much of the new Ticketmaster platform is contributing to that? And what are the benefits that venues are seeing from the new platform?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Sorry. This is Joe. Just to make sure we have the facts right, the 150 year-on-year, so since Q1 of last year the 150 additional clients, which are a combination of on the traditional Ticketmaster system as well as, again, as we've been focused on the specialty vertical, so things like our festival vertical has been very effective building, adding new customers as well. You want to talk about the TM one?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Doug, we've talked just philosophically, I mean, again when we took Ticketmaster over, it had been losing customers. Renewal rate was down to 70%. Its EBITDA had declined 20% a year for the five years before that. So now you sit here with Ticketmaster, where its EBITDA has grown. We've had a record ticket selling month. And our renewal rates are over 100%. So, I believe that if you ask our clients, the number one reason that they'll tell you that the business – why they've renewed, why they've signed up, why they have a new appreciation for Ticketmaster is that, over the last few years we, for the first time in 20 years, were the management team that was serious about investing and upgrading the tools that would help them sell more tickets. So for a venue, you know we've shown you in the past the green screen they had, but today they have an iPad with an app that lets them price their own tickets, publish their own shows, instant ticket sale delivery. I mean there's multiple ways it's been enhanced and elevated. So absolutely; I would not be sitting here years later with a green screen telling you just because we have a few concerts at Live Nation we were able to fix the business. But the new platform, all the new tools we've been developing and modulely (41:58) delivering to our client over the last year, I think is the fundamental reason that the business is now excelling. And a lot of that development also gets shipped internationally, and the reason we're able to scale faster there and grow our business is, we are going to be, again, able to use the learning and some product development from America on our international expansion, which again, never happened in the old TM. They were very separate – 14 separate platforms that shared no product development.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Ben Mogil with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. So first one I think probably either for Michael or for Joe. We've certainly, I guess, some of the music labels have been talking about doing more in the sponsorship area, more 360 deals. Universal has talked some about Honda Stage (42:55). They've talked about that vis-à-vis Vevo as well. From a competitive perspective, how are you viewing them within the dynamic, it's a big pie obviously, but curious how you are viewing the labels within that dynamic right now?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean we're not really in their business. I know they have a few sales guys trying to sell some IP. But at the core are, again, going back to our priority, our focus, the reason we have 900 sponsors, if we surveyed them tomorrow, 899 of them would tell you, because we have incredible on-site customer reach. We are the 70 million customers, we're bigger than the NFL, NBA. So most of our advertising always has been driven by, we have an incredible ability to reach on a Thursday night, in seat seven, a customer specific. When you added on Ticketmaster and we've started to get really rich in data about that customer, our business started to grow. When we then added on digital platform, an ability to say to a sponsor, we can deliver you on-site, and we can amplify that connection digitally, our business grew. So our core business, the customers, the brands that are looking to partner with us, that's a competitive proposition that we have. There has always been Vevo and MTV and many other digital video play auctions for brands, and some of them continue to do well, and the pie is big. But we see huge opportunity and we're the only one with 70 million or end-level of scale on site and added 66 million monthly digital customers. Nobody has that one-two punch to deliver to an advertiser. So we think there will be many playing on smaller scale on-site. There will be many playing on digital, even with bigger footprints, but the brands that want on-site meets on-line, we're the best opportunity for that.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's very fair. Thank you, Michael. And then probably a Kathy question. Thank you very much for the commentary on ticketing in terms of margins and what to expect for this year and what the non-recoups look like. On that sort of roughly $80 million, $82 million of non-recoups that you'll do here in the amortization line, how much of that is actually cash?
Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer: So, obviously, the cash is paid for contract through generally three years to five years. And at this point with that history cash is basically equivalent to expense.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And so, basically we've seen flat to the last year, so the year-over-year cash outflow and your cash flow from ops is basically pretty nil. Is that a reasonable way to look at it?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's essentially steady-state by this point in the history.
Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Brandon Ross with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the investments you guys have done in your ticketing technology. I was wondering if you could talk about where the technology in your established international ticketing business stands relative to domestic? And assuming it's behind, what kind of investment you need to make from here in that established international business to catch it up to the domestic business? And wanted to confirm that you guys have completed the re-platforming and major upgrades in the domestic ticketing business? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. I'll start with the second and work backwards. So, on one level, yes, we've completed the re-platforming. We've completed the work that we set out to do in 2011. As we've talked on other calls in the process what we learned about Ticketmaster is, it's a true technology company and it's a company that is going to be very much driven by the products that it creates for its venue clients, which, as Michael talked, are critical to our being the best ticketing platform to sell tickets for them and it's critical for fans they seem to drive that conversion rate, to drive the discovery to continue to sell the tickets. So we see, going forward, if we looked at our Ticketmaster system as a technology business so we'll continue to invest in those production. Now, as you note, we started with North America. A lot of that technology both at the website level as well as at the app for fan-facing and then also venue-facing has already been brought over to the U.K., Ireland and Australia, which use the same core underlying system that we've historically called the host system. Continental Europe is largely on a different system. That system already has a great deal more flexibility than what the historical host system had, but it is something that over the next couple of years we'll be looking to migrate a lot of the functionality. Again because we've built this in such a modular fashion, there's not a big bang, turn off one system, turn off the other. It's a matter of replacing components over time. We don't see a substantial shift from our current run rate of CapEx at Ticketmaster or CapEx as a percentage of our revenue to substantially deviate. And we think we can get it done within those spend levels.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: And how long do you think it's going to take to get to a real peak margin at Ticketmaster?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Well I think I talked about that earlier, which is the focus over the next few years is on driving the market share and the revenue and the AOI growth. So separate out what's the exactness of one piece of Ticketmaster, the operating model and how we're driving down our cost structure, which we are doing, with the fact that as we build other verticals those are inherently lower scale, often have different fee structures, and maybe lower margin yet faster growing. As we go into new international markets, with whatever system we deploy we're likely to start in those new markets at a lower scale, which is going to have some higher fixed cost associated with it. So our number one objective is to drive the cash side of the business because we absolutely believe that what matters most to our shareholders at the end of the day is the cash we generate. And we will take higher growth with more cash over shrinking to maximize the margin.
Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. At this time I'd like to turn the conference back over to your presenters for any additional and/or closing comments.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, everybody. We'll talk to you in Q2.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Financial Officer (sic) [Chief Executive Officer] of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. 2015 closed as a record year for Live Nation, driving both financial and operating results. Revenue, AOI and free cash flow all grew 11% for the year, and delivered record ticket volume of 530 million tickets. We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong global consumer demand. Live is truly a unique entertainment form that cannot be duplicated. It is elevated and not threatened by technology and is borderless. Fans around the world can now discover, follow, share, and embrace artists, creating even greater demand for live shows. We believe the live music sector will continue to have strong growth for years to come, as fans globally drive demand, artists are motivated to tour, and technology is driving awareness and conversion. And we're seeing this come to life in our Live Nation Concerts division, which continued to grow its global market share, adding 5 million fans in 2015 for a total of over 63 million fans, while promoting 25,000 concerts, up 12% in the year from last year. We've built on our global leadership position in every part of the business, with more fans in both North America and international, and across our full portfolio of arenas, amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. The ongoing flow of new artists also continues to re-energize the business. And in 2015, 13 of the top 20 selling artists were new from the previous year. We see growth continuing into 2016. And through February 19, ticket sales were up 5% year-on-year, driven by 18% growth in amphitheaters and 47% growth in stadiums. We are confident we will again see strong growth in fan demand across our business this year. Our Live Nation Advertising business grew 17% in 2015 at constant currency, increasing both on-site and online advertising, as we grew our global sponsor base by 20% to almost 900 brands. Onsite advertising drove the majority of our growth for the year, as we increased advertising per fan by 8% by continuing to develop new products for sponsors at our events. With 63 million attendees, Live Nation provides brands an audience larger than the NFL, NBA or NHL for direct consumer engagement. And we continue to see brands shifting dollars onsite. We also continued leveraging video content from our events, generating over 300 million views in 2015 on Live Nation Web and App and through our distribution partners at Yahoo!, Snapchat, YouTube and Apple. We expect continued advertising AOI growth at historic rate levels in 2016, with over 60% of our budgeted advertising for the year already sold and pacing ahead of last year at this time by double-digits. For the fifth straight year, Ticketmaster grew its ticketing volume and GTV by 12% at constant currency. Delivering over $25 billion in GTV, Ticketmaster continues to be one of the top global e-commerce sites operating in 23 countries. In 2015, secondary ticketing continued to be a major focus, now operating in 13 countries and delivering 34% growth in GTV per year of $1.2 billion at constant currency. As we focus on improving the fan buying experience, there continues to be a rapid shift to mobile devices as the preferred purchasing platform. At the end of 2015, over 21 million fans have downloaded one of our apps, a 37% increase over last year. This drove a 20% increase in mobile tickets for the year to 21% of total tickets. Entering 2016, the Ticketmaster marketplace is better positioned than ever as the ticketing leader in 16 countries. We have grown our client base each year over the last five years and, combining the primary and secondary marketplaces, have substantially increased inventory available to fans and conversion by 38%. We have heavily invested in online and mobile products to increase visits to our site and conversion. And as a result, already in 2016, we have three days selling over 900,000 tickets, placing them among the top 15 days of all time, setting us up to deliver a robust growth in 2016. As we look forward in 2016, all key indicators for each of our businesses are up on year-on-year into February, pointing to continued strong growth in 2016. We plan on holding more concerts for more fans in more countries than ever before. We expect to sell more advertising both onsite and online. And through continued product innovation at Ticketmaster, we plan on selling more tickets and driving increased conversion. Over the last three years, we have grown AOI by 34% and free cash flow by 45%, and we expect Live Nation to continue delivering this level of growth that we have demonstrated over the last several years. We see the global live sector continuing to be very robust from a supply and demand perspective. Combining a growing global industry and Live Nation's ability to grow its leadership position, we expect to continue driving long-term value for shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Joe, who will take you through additional details on the divisions.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first Concerts, for the full year, concert revenue was up 11% and AOI up 36%, both at constant currency. We grew attendance by 8% to a record 63 million fans, once again promoting 20 of the top 25 global tours, including U2, Madonna, One Direction, and Ariana Grande. And we've continued our global expansion with three new countries, including adding promoters in Germany, the second largest European concert market. For the year, looking at the markets, in North America, we grew attendance by 9% to almost 44 million fans with show counts up 6% and attendance per show up 3%. In arena and amphitheater, attendance were each up by over 1 million fans. Internationally, attendance was up 7%, driven by arena attendance growing over 1 million fans. Globally, we continued growing our festival portfolio, increasing attendance by 1.5 million to over 6 million for the year. Following our acquisition of Bonnaroo, we now own four of the top five festivals in North America. In addition to growing global market share through more shows, more fans and more markets, in 2015 we increased our onsite fan monetization at amphitheaters and festivals by 6% to $19.50 per fan. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, concert revenue was up 17% and AOI up 30%, both at constant currency. These results were driven by a 15% increase in attendance to over 15 million fans, with a 13% increase in show count. Of this, North America attendance grew by 9% in the quarter, largely from festival and amphitheater activity, and international attendance was up 26% driven by arena activity. As we move into 2016, through mid-February, ticket sales are up as Michael said, and our confirmed show pipeline for amphitheaters, arenas and stadiums is up 15%. And we already have two artists, Coldplay and Beyoncé, that have each sold over 1 million tickets for tours this year. At Artist Nation, revenue was up 13% at constant currency in 2015. Last year, we broadened our relationships with a great set of managers and artists and expanded into new business lines. Looking forward, we expect this business to continue feeding our Concerts business and providing an important foundation of support for all our businesses. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, Sponsorship & Advertising delivered 17% revenue and 15% AOI growth for the year at constant currency. And in fourth quarter, at constant currency, revenue was up 11% and AOI was flat as we compare the AOI to the fourth quarter 2014 when we had 24% year-on-year growth. Finally, Ticketmaster. In 2015, ticketing revenue was up 10% while AOI was up 11%, as we grew global GTV on fee-bearing tickets by 12%, all at constant currency. Achieving these results at Ticketmaster came from delivering on three key drivers. First, increasing our ticket inventory, which was accomplished by maintaining our net renewal rate at over 100% for the sixth straight year and building our secondary marketplace with nearly double the number of events having integrated inventory. Second, with improved products, we drove a 10% increase in site visits along with increased conversion from integrated inventory. This drove primary GTV growth of 10% for the year and secondary GTV growth of 34%, both at constant currency. And finally, we delivered the $0.35 per ticket North America cost savings that we targeted. For the fourth quarter, our GTV and revenue were both up 11% and AOI up 10% at constant currency. So in summary, in 2015, each of our core businesses grew revenue and AOI as we successfully delivered the final year of our three-year plan. Looking forward, in 2016, we expect to continue our growth with Concerts, Advertising, and Ticketing leading indicators all strongly up, giving us confidence in our ability to continue growing our business at historical rates. A few points of note, first, from a phasing standpoint, with our planned strong summer season across amphitheaters, arenas, and stadiums, we expect our AOI to be even more Q3 driven this year and a bit more Q2 driven as well. And on FX, we don't see a material impact on Q1 at this point. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with our results for the fourth quarter, revenue is $1.8 billion, up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2014, and AOI is $111 million, up 54% over last year, both at constant currency. As reported revenue is $1.7 billion and AOI is $101 million. Free cash flow is $10 million for the quarter. All of our segments delivered revenue growth for the quarter. Concerts delivered the majority of the growth from higher festival and amphitheater activity in North America, and increased arena activity internationally. Ticketing revenue was up due to both higher primary and secondary ticket volume. Reported AOI for the fourth quarter was $101 million, up 40% from the fourth quarter last year. FX impact for the quarter reduced AOI by $10 million, or 9%. The majority of our AOI growth in the quarter came from the Concerts and Artist Nation segments. Concerts improved from increased show activity, and Artist Nation AOI was driven by higher management commissions and increased profitability within new service lines. Our operating loss in the fourth quarter was $34 million on a constant currency basis, up 17% compared to the normalized loss of $41 million last year that excluded non-cash charges of $146 million. FX impacts in the quarter increased the operating loss by $7 million to $41 million on a reported basis. Our net loss for the quarter was $71 million at constant currency, a 12% improvement from the normalized net loss last year of $81 million, again excluding non-cash charges. The FX impact for the fourth quarter increased the net loss by $7 million to $78 million on a reported basis. Moving to the full year results, revenue is $7.6 billion, AOI is $616 million and free cash flow is $362 million, each up 11% over last year at constant currency. As reported, revenue is $7.2 billion, AOI is $578 million, and free cash flow is $335 million. For the full year, all of our segments delivered double-digit revenue growth. Concerts was the largest driver with growth in our North America arena, festival, and amphitheater results, along with strong arena activity internationally. The other main driver of the increase was in ticketing with higher primary and resale ticket volume driven by more concerts and professional sporting events. AOI for the full year was $578 million, as reported. FX impact for the year reduced AOI by $38 million or 6%. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI grew 15% at constant currency from higher festival sponsorships and online advertising. Ticketing AOI was up 11% at constant currency, driven by the growth in primary and secondary ticket sales. And Concerts AOI was up 36% at constant currency from higher show activity. Operating income at constant currency was $156 million for the full year, in line with normalized operating income of $161 million last year, excluding non-cash charges. FX impact for the year reduced the operating income by $25 million to $131 million on a reported basis for 2015. Our net loss for the year was $13 million at constant currency. The FX impact for the year increased the net loss by $20 million to $33 million on a reported basis. Free cash flow for the year is $362 million at constant currency, up 11% over last year, driven by our growth in AOI. Moving to our key balance sheet items. As of December 31, we had total cash of $1.3 billion, including $549 million in ticketing client cash and $351 million in net concert event related cash with a free cash balance of $403 million. Cash flow from operations was $300 million for 2015, an increase of 8% compared to $277 million last year. Our total deferred revenue for future shows as of the end of 2015 was $553 million, up 19% over the $464 million at the end of 2014. Our total capital expenditures for the year were $145 million, with maintenance CapEx of $79 million and revenue-generating CapEx of $66 million. Going forward, we expect total capital expenditures to continue to be around 2% of revenue. As of December 31, our total net debt was $2 billion and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.2%. Our debt covenant requires a maximum leverage ratio of 4.75 times, and we are comfortably in compliance with this. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: And we will first go to Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I have two questions, one on ticketing and one on ad sponsorship. So StubHub has talked about growth slowing in 2016 and that probably bodes well for you. But can you give us some additional color on market share and progress in the secondary market? And then secondly, as you expand globally, how are your conversations changing with your sponsors and ad buyers?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll do the sponsorship, which is the easier one, and we'll look into ticketing, which revolves around share. Our Sponsorship business, we have as we said 900 sponsors. Our business of those 900, a majority of those are a local or a regional business. So when we open an office in South Africa, our first priority is to build a local sponsorship team to take advantage of the regional Coca-Cola or Audi dealership ad dollars, who are usually the easiest and more likely to spend on an onsite regional basis. So every time we open up a regional office, we get to enter a new business called the regional advertising business. And then the top 10% of our sponsors, the Citibanks, the American Expresses, the Pepsis of the world, the more times we walk into top kind of 15, 20 cities around the world, we start to be able to expand our U.S. deal, which started in American Express, but then became a U.S./Canada deal, then it became a U.S., Canada and European deal, and now we've just added Australia to it. So as we build, we're able to attract those global brands and provide them a global footprint. If you think about it, really the only other sport that can do that is kind of FIFA World Cup or the Olympics. Most of everything else is a local business. So we do provide that brand like Anheuser-Busch, who we're talking to on a global basis, a global platform solution. And we see that as a big opportunity in how we'll keep our double-digit growth. On secondary.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. On secondary, obviously it's a little bit of guesswork on the market share, Amy. I think our take would be that our market share is now in the 20s. From StubHub's reported numbers, seems like they're likely in the 50s. Seems that we both grew in 2015 faster than overall market, so continued to build share. We remain very positive on our positioning and our ability to continue to drive our growth and share overall. When you look at the asset base that we have, the partnerships with the teams and the leagues and the very rapid growth that we've seen on Ticketmaster with our integrated inventory, and now that we're in 13 countries and at varying levels of integration between the primary and secondary, I think we remain very positive about 2016 with that business.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We will now go to Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I'm going to break the rules here a little bit, but maybe you'll indulge me, because I'm really asking you a question. That's my job, not yours. I am perplexed by the way your stock has traded sort of over the last two months. And I don't know if you have any insight in terms of why you think the market is nervous about something, and if at all you think these results have sort of addressed whatever the buy side's concerns may be.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think there's a whole bunch of debate out there on what's happened in the last couple months in the market overall. So we certainly have felt it. We talk to our top shareholders, the long players. Our long shareholders seem to understand that our fundamental business is strong with great growth potential. So we can't give you any perfect insight into what would have been the reason for any decline over the last couple months. But as we say, we're just thrilled that going into this quarter we were going to put down a record 2015 on our way to hopefully a record 2016. So we've been public 10 years now and we've lived long enough to know that the stock price will follow the good results eventually in between the noise in the middle. So we're very confident, we've got a very strong business that we'll continue to grow, put the cash flow on the table and be a really good option for a investment in the entertainment or the music space.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we will now go to Ben Mogil with Stifel.
Kevin Lee Hon Siong - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you. This is actually Kevin Lee for Ben. Thank you for taking the question. A few years ago, you gave multiple-year guidance and the drivers behind that. Not expecting it – this on this call, but when you look at the core engines of Ticketing and Sponsorship, I just want to dig a little deeper. What takes Ticketing from, say, the current level to, say, $425 million or so of AOI? Is it more cost efficiency, more primary or secondary volume? And similarly, on Sponsorship, what kind of gets it to the $325 million level? Is it more impressions, volume, or is it just moving up the rate card? Thank you.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Yes. I think we're doing a good job, at least in this call, of suggesting that we believe we'll repeat history in terms of our growth rate. So if you looked at our stock over the last three years and what we've been able to do on a revenue and a cash flow perspective, we see no reason why we can't continue to grow this business at the similar rates. In order to grow, I mean number one is we have an incredible unique business model at this point. With our scale leveraged across our flywheel, we're able to drive some more concerts, which drives a bigger audience, which drives more sponsors, which drives more ticketing fees. So you're really starting to see the flywheel effect of our business. So how will we grow Ticketing? Both ways you mentioned. We'll continue to be more efficient as our new and improved technology comes to life, and we get to retire our old platform and technology that was much more inefficient. So we'll have a per-ticket savings over time, and we'll continue to drive our savings on that side. But we still have Ticketmaster on a global basis. And one of the things we've done I think really well at Ticketmaster when we took over is to redefine our business. Ticketmaster was looked always at a very I think narrow perspective of the business called Arenas in America. And we look at Ticketing on a global basis, so why we talk about being in 22 countries and growing that, why we're very excited on secondary to get way ahead of the curve on those other 12 markets outside of America. So we think we can grow the pie, we can grow our market share within secondary and grow it on a global basis. And we still think we have a lot of room, whether it be in clubs and theaters with TicketWeb, one of our products, whether it's festivals with Front Line, we still think we have room in a lot of the niches within the industry that we have currently or historically not served. So we think we have lots of room to grow vertical and horizontal in ticketing as well as achieving costs through a more efficient platform. Sponsorship, as I said, is kind of – the bigger a platform becomes on a global basis, the more people we put through the turnstiles, the more attractive we are to Madison Avenue. So we're seeing – we're able to increase our ad units, rate card as you said, taking a local partner up to a regional partner or renew him at a higher rate, because we have better assets both onsite and online. So we look at Sponsorship, it's somewhere in the $2 billion number is what the latest reports would say is spent on music in America out of the advertising budget. So we're still, we would say, dramatically under our market share. We could double our Advertising business before we have to actually even get out of that kind of $2 billion that is dedicated by Madison Avenue to go spend on music onsite activation. So we still think there's a big pie available. The better our ad units and the better our positioning of our business is for Madison Avenue, we think we will continue to grow that business through rate card and through higher per-deal metrics.
Kevin Lee Hon Siong - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much.
Operator: We will now go to David Joyce with Evercore ISI.
David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI: Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some more color on some recent transactions. In South Africa, how much business were you already flowing through there and what does this new deal do for you? Is it solely promotions? I know you spoke earlier of the opportunity to open a sponsorship office. But if you could help us understand what that does for your growth, that sort of thing. And then secondly on the Sacramento markets, you acquired a property. I'm not sure if it's actually a real estate deal, but it's something that'll be programmed or continue to be programmed like House of Blues. What does that do for you as opposed to a much bigger, say, festival acquisition where you start to see positive results after a year? Thank you.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll work backwards. Sacramento, I was surprised how much press I did see on that one too, given the size of it. So that would have been our theater and, I mean they must have very good PR people at the Ace of Spades that we're doing the deal with. But it's a theater club. We have theater and club division. We would book/manage over 100 theaters or clubs, kind of in the 1,000 to 3,000 range. It's a strong category for us globally. And my team, under Ron Bension, is continually looking for theaters and clubs where we would be taking over booking to drive our business into. So that'd be a small deal in relative terms to our business. But that 100-plus theaters and clubs, which is a great platform for us because it tends to be younger skewed, which means we get to present to the Red Bulls and the young sponsors that are really looking for a very young demo, and it also drives our ticketing business. So they're continually looking for opportunistic theater or clubs to manage and/or book in a kind of a non-CapEx manner. As far as South Africa, it continues to be our 41 countries and a path we've been on. When you look around the world, there tends to be these markets like South Africa, Cape Town, where there may be an established promoter who really has a strong market share. He is the go-to kind of promoter or business for any artist that goes to South Africa. We've been working with Attie for years, and he's been our go-to promoter for years. So at a certain point, we've been talking about a deal where instead of spending Rihanna and selling off to Attie where he's monetizing all of the local business, you get to a point where our business is so scalable now on a global basis that when we move into markets like that and acquire and continue to consolidate kind of the global footprint, we then our synergies of drive with local promoter, build our sponsor business and drive our ticketing economics, make it very accretive for us. South Africa, we don't think it's a short-term a big business for us, but we think over long term over the next five years, we think it is a growth industry, one of those emerging markets that, again, if you are a 19-year old fan in South Africa, Cape Town right now, you are on YouTube and you're dying to see Rihanna or Beyoncé. So the more and more we sit with these artists and talk about what's their global plans, the more and more they are now looking at places like South America and Asia and South Africa and Cape Town to add to their itinerary. And we want to be ahead of the curve on having our platform in place so we can monetize that content when it touches down.
David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We will now go to John Tinker with Gabelli Brokerage Company.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thanks. Hi. Just a couple of quick questions. On the three-year guidance you've hit, as you go forward, how important are acquisitions for you in order to hit sort of a double-digit AOI number as opposed to organic growth?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: John, this is Joe. I think if you look at our business model, we have always viewed tuck-in acquisitions as an integral part where we look to buy pieces that we can feed into the flywheel and add ticketing, add sponsorship, leverage up those. But really the foundation is organic. With the flywheel where it is now, it's now at a scale that we think we can drive very strong growth. And then again, you're just looking in for little pieces that you can build on top of. Like the one we were just talking about, when we bring ticketing, we bring sponsorship, and really put a lot of organic growth on top of the pieces that we put together.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: And secondly, this may not be a totally fair question. Liberty Media is creating three tracking stocks in the next couple of months. And their ownership in, their stake in you will be kept in Liberty Media, and Sirius and Atlanta Braves will be spun off. But you'll also basically be with 20% of the Atlanta Braves. How do you think you fit into sort of the Liberty Media structure? And do you see any crossovers in any way with the Braves?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You led with I think it was an unfair question, is that how you phrased it?
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: No, I was giving you an out.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You can ask them at the next Liberty investor dinner we go to. Listen, Liberty has been a great, solid shareholder for us there. Greg and John and Mark Carleton have been very instrumental in playing long with our strategy. We've made them a lot of money since we merged businesses and we both have done very well together. And we would expect Liberty to be a long-term shareholder and a great contributor to our strategy. Where and how they do what with their tracking stocks, as you know, that's not important to me. What's important is that we deliver good returns for our shareholders and good things happen when that happens. And that's our focus and we'll keep doing that for Liberty and others.
John Tinker - Gabelli & Company: Thanks.
Operator: And we will go to Rich Tullo with Albert Fried.
Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. How should we be thinking about ticketing – I mean concert growth in 2016? Are we talking about expenses on a percentage basis equivalent to what happened in 2015? And is there any areas in particular driving the growth? And on Latin America, is there anything to be concerned about given the geopolitical volatility in Brazil and Venezuela?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: All right. So in terms of the 2016 outlook, I think a few of the things that we gave you were that year-to-date our sales are up 5% driven with very strong amphitheater up 18% and stadiums up 47%, and also that our – if you look at our pipeline of confirmed shows today versus the pipeline of confirmed shows across amphitheaters, arenas, and festivals a year ago at this time, that's up 15%. So both of those metrics are indicating that all of our core type of shows are looking up this year. Stadium was a bit of a lighter year last year, so you're seeing a much higher percentage uptick this year than in the others, but every one of those numbers indicates continued strong growth. I don't think we're at a point where we're going to call exactness on that yet, but certainly looking good from where we're at. In terms of Latin America, again, for us, this is a global portfolio of 40 countries and 25,000 concerts with 60 million fans. I think our experience is, is that in any given year you'll have economically, politically a little bit on the margins of ups and downs, but nothing that we at all see would have any material impact on our business.
Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much.

Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2015 conference call. Live Nation had a record third quarter and remains on track to deliver its planned growth and record performance in 2015. Our key financial metrics are up for the quarter with revenue growing 10% and AOI up 8%, both at constant currency. Our operating metrics reinforce the strength of our business with 10% increase in fans attending our concerts in the quarter, driving strong growth in our advertising and ticketing business. This demonstrates that Live Nation has created an unparalleled live platform, bringing over 500 million fans in nearly 40 countries to that magical live event. The live business continues to have a robust outlook as artists are now fully reliant on touring as a main earnings driver and the best means to engage and connect with their fan base. And fans more than ever rate live experiences from club shows to festivals as one of the top entertainment sources and a majority of those attendees are sharing that event online, making event some of the most shared activities in social media, resulting in awareness growing for our event. At Live Nation, we see a great runway still ahead given the fragmented global landscape in concert, management and ticketing. And as our scale continues to grow, we will drive increasing economics in our business model with higher profits per show, more advertising and increased ticket conversion. In our concert division, the concert fan demand remained strong globally and we're continuing to grow by taking share promoting of the 20 of the top the 25 global tours this year including U2, One Direction and Luke Bryan. We're also further growing our portfolio with over 24 million fans attending our shows in the third quarter and as of October 26, we have sold 54 million tickets for shows this year, up 8% from last year. We continue to add more markets to our global footprint by adding Marek Lieberberg, the leading promoter in Germany to our global network of over 40 markets. Equally important is our focus on improving the fan experience and driving onsite revenues with per fan revenue at our venues up 8% or $30 million in constant currency so far this year. With core visibility for the year, we are confident we will again grow our concert live world by delivering 25,000 shows over 60 million fans. Our global reach and portfolio of artists, markets and shows is unparalleled in the live event business and continued success in concert is driving our overall business. Our sponsorship and advertisement business continues to deliver strong margins and growth to drive our AOI. For the first nine months sponsorship is up 19% in both revenue and AOI at constant currency. This growth has been driven by online advertising and a 40% growth in our festival sponsorship business in the third quarter at constant currency. Our key leading indicator for advertising is contracted net revenue, which is up 16% on a constant currency basis as of the end of the third quarter and we have sold over 90% of our planned sponsorship and advertising for the year. On the content side, we have launched Live Nation TV in beta and we are pleased with our overall portfolio of live-based content consisting of Yahoo! Live festival streaming and VICE original programming. They are all building and we have now delivered over 100 million streams to-date. We plan on further building our content presence to maximize on site content and brand demand. We believe we added great growth opportunities as we improved the advertising experience with brands that want to reach that highly desirable music fan on site and on all screen in a highly targeted fashion. Ticketmaster continues building its position as a global leader in the ticketing marketplace with 8% growth in the global site visits, driving an 18% increase in combined primary and secondary GTV during the third quarter. Our secondary business continued its strong performance with GTV up 22% in the quarter and our platform continues to take global market share with a superior offering of both primary and secondary. The same time, we continue to execute on our mobile core strategy rolling out improved mobile web, web and app experiences, including Apple Pay and integration into Apple Spotlight functionality. As a result of these improvements, 60% of our web traffic is on mobile devices and our total app installed base grew 39% year-on-year. With this, mobile net ticket sales are now 23% through September, accounting for 21% of total ticket sales. While we are improving the fan experience and delivering future scale in our ticketing marketplace, we also continue to deploy new venue products and reduce our cost structure. We are on track to have our new TMOne platform available for all North American venue clients by the end of the year and we expect to deliver the $0.35 per ticket cost reduction as planned. As a result, in 2015, we expect to deliver the fifth straight year of growth in our ticketing client base, global GTV and ticketing AOI. In summary, we now have very clear visibility into our full 2015 performance and we are confident that we'll deliver another year of record top line and bottom line results. Our scale businesses of concert, advertising and ticketing are all showing growth in the key operating metrics and we expect them to operationally deliver record revenue and AOI. As we look forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue consolidating concerts and ticketing on a global basis and further growth in our advertising and ticketing businesses in the concert flywheel. With that, I will turn it over to Joe to take you through additional details on divisional performance.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first concerts. Live Nation concerts revenue in the third quarter was up 9% and AOI was up 6% on a constant currency basis. The revenue growth was driven by a 10% increase in attendance at our shows for the quarter, specifically our amphitheaters had over 10 million fans that attend 1,100 shows, is an all-time high, up over 1 million fans from Q3 last year. Arena attendance was up 30% to over 4 million fans for the quarter and festival attendance for Q3 was a record of 3.5 million fans. This translated into a record summer, looking to Q2 and Q3 for concerts with 40 million fans attending 12,000 shows globally, 9% higher attendance than last year. For the full year, we expect to deliver record attendance, increasing by about 3 million fans with 25,000 shows. And as a result, we expect to deliver strong double-digit AOI growth in our concerts business for the full year. At Artist Nation, revenue was up 6% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date at constant currency as we have been successful in growing our artist management and related businesses. AOI for the quarter is up 39% as we continue investing in new business lines, notably in sports management. And for the full year, we expect to deliver high single-digit revenue growth with Q4 largely in line with last year. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. Our sponsorship and advertising revenue for the third quarter grew by 17% and AOI was up 16% at constant currency. 62% of our revenue growth this quarter came from festival sponsorship, which increased 39% year-on-year at constant currency and festival sponsorship growth this year came primarily from increased monetization of our fans as we grew revenue per fan by 33% globally at constant currency. With over 95% of our sponsorship and advertising net revenue contracted for the year, we continue to expect full year AOI growth in the low teens at constant currency. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 16% and AOI was up 18% as global GTV increased 18%, all at constant currency. Primary GTV for the quarter was up 18% with a 12% increase in fee-bearing ticket sold. We continue to expect low to mid single-digit growth in primary fee bearing ticket volume and high single-digit growth in primary GTV for the year. Secondary GTV was up 22% for the quarter and it is up 40% year-to-date. Given the seasonal timing of sport, most of our secondary growth in the third quarter came from the concert segment, which was up 42%. Q4 will again be our biggest quarter for secondary GTV here in the NFL, NBA and NHL exchanges and we expect continued momentum in the quarter with ongoing double-digit growth rates in secondary GTV. We also continue to see strong fan response to our integrated primary and secondary offering on Ticketmaster with conversion rates 30% higher than primary only offering. The combination of primary and secondary GTV growth along with improved cost structure now gives us confidence, our ticketing business will deliver high single-digit AOI growth for the year. In summary, now nine months into the year, we have good visibility into delivering our 2015 plan. At this point of the year, we have most of our shows booked, concert ticket sold, sponsor signed up and visibility to sporting events and concert on sales to be confident on our performance for the year. With regards to FX in the quarter, we saw similar results in the third quarter as we did in the first and second with revenues and AOI both impacted by about 5%. And looking ahead, as we discussed we see strong runway for continued growth across our business lines. Our concert show pipeline for 2016, the earliest indicator we have looks very strong and is up double-digits from this time last year. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Joe. And good afternoon, everyone. Starting with our results for the third quarter. Revenue is $2.8 billion, up 10% from the same period in 2014 and AOI is $279 million, up 8% over last year, both at constant currency. As reported revenue is $2.6 billion and AOI is $266 million. Free cash flow is $205 million. Revenue growth for the quarter was driven by higher concerts revenue from increased shows in North America amphitheaters and arenas along with acquisition activity. Ticketing revenue growth also drove the increase with higher primary and resale revenue. Reported AOI for the third quarter was $266 million, 3% higher than last year. FX impact for the third quarter reduced AOI by $13 million or 5%. The majority of the AOI growth came from our ticketing and sponsorship and advertising segment. Ticketing AOI was driven by the higher primary and resale activity. Sponsorship and advertising AOI increased with higher festival sales along with other new sponsors. Concerts AOI was at 6% to last year at constant currency, while Artist Nation AOI was impacted by our continued investment in new service lines. Our operating income for the quarter was $154 million compared to $151 million last year. The FX impact to operating for the third quarter was a decrease of $10 million. Net income was $89 million compared to $105 million last year with an increase in taxes driven by the growth in profitability internationally. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $205 million, in line with last year. Now for the nine months results. Revenue is up 9% from last year to $5.8 billion and AOI is $504 million, up 4% over 2014 both at constant currency. As reported, revenue is $5.5 billion and AOI is $477 million. Our free cash flow for the nine months is $320 million or 67% of AOI. Revenue for the nine months was driven by growth in concerts from higher show activity in North American arenas and amphitheaters and acquisitions. The other main driver of the increase was ticketing with its higher revenue in both primary and resale tickets. All of our other business segments also delivered revenue growth over last year. AOI for the nine months was $477 million, as reported. FX impact for the nine months reduced AOI by $27 million or 5%. Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew 19% at constant currency, driven by increased festival sponsorship and higher online advertising. Ticketing AOI was up 11% at constant currency with higher primary and resale ticket sales. Concerts AOI was essentially flat, and Artist Nation's AOI was impacted from the investments in new service lines. Operating income was $172 million for the nine months compared to $194 million last year, with an $18 million reduction due to FX changes. Our net income for the nine months was $46 million versus $96 million last year, which was impacted by $9 million in additional acquisition-related tax benefits recognized in 2014, and a $31 million loss from non-cash adjustments to certain working capital accounts due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Free cash flow for the nine months is $320 million, in line with last year. During the first nine months of 2015, our cash flow was used primarily for acquisitions, artist advances for future tours and revenue generating CapEx. Moving to our key balance sheet items. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.1 billion, including $547 million in ticketing client cash and $262 million in net concert event-related cash, with a free cash balance of $252 million. Our cash used in operating activities was $23 million for the nine months, an increase of $16 million over last year because of higher receivables in 2015 driven by the increased third quarter show activity. At the end of September, our concerts related deferred revenue for tickets sold for future events at our owned or operated venues was $441 million, a 38% increase over September last year. Our total capital expenditures for the nine months were $94 million, and we expect that our capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $155 million, around 2% of revenue, in line with our previous guidance. As of September 30, our total debt was $2 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. Our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of 5 times, and we are comfortably in compliance with this. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you, Ms. Willard. And our first question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you, and congratulations on another great quarter. So, I have a bigger picture question. As you are wrapping up your three-year plan, it seems like a lot of the large scale acquisition spending is over. Where do you think are the largest buckets of organic growth over the next few years?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Amy. It's Michael. First of all, I would say we still believe that there are some great acquisition opportunities available across the globe too that we think we can grow our business at a very accretive rate. But aside from that regardless of acquisitions, if you look at the historic business, we have been delivering most of our growth on an organic basis and we think we can continue to do more of that. We're going to do three things that are going to drive organic growth ongoing. Number one is what we talked about always is our advertising business. We think that has great runway because we believe Madison Avenue is going to continue shift more dollars to kind of event-based engaged business. We got a great platform. So we think the tide will rise on more dollars being spent in the events business and we'll continue to capture more of that as well as we grow our digital content business and on the mobile front, we'll be able to attract that. So we believe advertising will organically probably be our highest margin largest growth engine to our business. Ticketing, we believe, it just keeps getting better and better because all of the features and functions and products of our new mobile app coming out in 2016 to our expanded product offering. We just got a very robust roadmap ahead of us and we think all of those features and functions that we roll out across the globe at TM just help drive that conversion and incremental ticket. So that again is a high margin business because it's an incremental ticket against the cost base that's been spent. And three, we mentioned the onsite business. We just hired a Chief Revenue Officer who had a history at both Disney and Universal Theme Parks, who has been analyzing our onsite business. We beta tested these summer, six amphitheaters with a new food and beverage supplier, our new Live Nation at the venue app where it has everything from weekend entry to upgrade your seat to get your beer delivered to your seat, the cashless F&B and we saw some great results this summer when we provide a Wi-Fi connected environment, give that customer, let's call it the magic band, but its built into the app. Giving that customer an easier, frictionless experience onsite both at the festival or amps or House of Blues and we think that will be a big driver of our per head spend. So we think those three areas alone executing better and increased products in all three of those areas would be a big piece of our ongoing forward growth that will continue to drive us to record years.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Moving on to David Joyce with Evercore.
David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI: Thank you. One of my question, I was just wondering about the phasing of the event timing with what you really experienced for the third quarter versus what you thought would be comparably shifting into the fourth. I was just wondering, there is still a lot of deferred revenue and prepaid expenses I think that is reflected in free cash indicating that there is a lot of volume in the fourth quarter. But was there anything that timing-wise got accelerated into the third or is everything still as planned from the last call?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: I think things are still largely as planned. Q4 is a very big quarter for us this year in terms of show count, heavily driven on the theaters and club side. So that show count number is high. I think what you saw this summer, as we've talked about in the past, is just a seasonal, temporal, fewer stadiums this year, more amphitheaters, more arenas, more festivals and we think we disproportionally grew and took share during the summer season but largely what we expected in terms of show count attendance.
David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI: So sponsorship and advertising will be later in the fourth quarter due to the size of the venue of the events that are on the slate?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Well, again, it's not so much size of the venue. It is just – again, we talked about festival sponsorship in the past. We've talked about that's far and away our highest sponsorship per fan. Those are predominantly Q2, Q3 event. But just when you rollout the map that tends to be where you see your growth.
David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI: And on Artist Nation, you talked about how AOI should shake out for the fourth quarter, obviously there is more spending for the sports management this quarter. Is that infrastructure largely in place or is there going to be more spending to ramp that up or build that out for next year?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: No. I mean, that spending is largely in place and will continue. We expect to start to see more revenue from that next year and in just Q4, trying to give some guidance in terms of level of overall activity.
Operator: And Doug Arthur with Huber Research has the next question.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah, two questions. First sort of a technical issue. You had, looks like you had about a 40% increase in international events year-over-year in the third quarter. How much of that is acquisition related and how much of it is just timing? And then the second question, Michael on TMOne platform, what would you sort of characterize as sort of the five main benefits from it to the venues. Thank you.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: International, we've had no real acquisitions that would be driving activity. Most of those acquisitions in the last year would have been in the U.S. festival space. So, Europe just had strong year as did North America, all organic. As far as ticketing, we've been very, very honest and clear with everyone that we bought a – Ticketmaster has a very old platform. And part of the challenge with the platform was it just wasn't technically enough to grade 2015 web-based platform that lets us just be innovative and flexible and fast. So obviously the biggest part about having a new platform is we get to build an ongoing new mobile business that's much more flexible and can move with the times, meaning today historically when you want to get a new iPad or new iOS update or Android, everything was very expensive and hard on our old platform to move and build. So, the biggest fundamental advantage is our new platform has a much more robust, flexible base to it. For the venues, we have an open API platform strategy there so we can plug-and-play with a lot of their needs whether it's the CRM or security or any partners that they need us to partner with for the venue. Our app will come to life in real terms next year, will be much more robust and convert much higher than our current one. And then at the core of a venue, what the venue really is looking for is a saleforce.com kind of strategy. They want a very robust, but simple user interface to manage their event, to staff their event, to sell their event, to market it, to change the ticket prices, to build it. Our new platform TMOne is very user-friendly. Every venue will have a host of great tools available from pricing, data analytics, search, marketing, publishing. It's a world-class platform that no one in the world would have the robust amount of data and analytical tools to help view the venue, build your show, put it out, market it, distribute it if you want to sell tickets to other partners. It's a very robust platform. It's going to put all the tools now in your hands to be the best at selling, understanding your market, understanding pricing, we believe ultimately selling more tickets because we're putting a lot more tools and data into the hands of every box office and every general manager in a venue.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll now hear from Ben Mogil with Stifel.
Kevin Lee Hon Siong - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thank you. This is actually Kevin Lee for Ben. Just a quick question on the secondary ticketing market. Of the growth you're seeing in GTV, how much is that from share shift from competitors and how much do think is coming from Ticketmaster growing the actual secondary market? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Kevin, this is Joe Berchtold. There is not a great industry information out there in terms of getting specific on that, but we absolutely believe that we are taking share on a global basis with the quality of product that we're delivering, starting with the joint primary and secondary inventory we're putting on Ticketmaster and then getting into our league exchanges. So we don't have exactness of those numbers, but we absolutely believe with the high growth that we have in that business that we are taking share.
Kevin Lee Hon Siong - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company has the next question.
Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Little factoid, you grew Ticketmaster, your growth is as big as the whole Ticketfly. And they have a $550 million valuation, so that's I don't know what's Ticketmaster worth $20 billion? Over the last couple of days, you've seen Adele and Rihanna seeking to pitch sponsorship deals ahead of their concerts. Are you in that mix? How does that help you and how does that influence your business? I suspect it's generally favorable. But I'm just curious to see how it works?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Tullo, I'm still digesting your $20 billion valuation. That's question of the day, but.
Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: So it was just off the top of my head, I was just using like Reed Hastings, Ted Sarandos' numbers.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We certainly believe we have a very valuable asset that has lots of expansion ahead of it. Joe will dig in on the second part.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Yes. At its heart, Rich, our job is what the concert promoter and ticketing company is to sell ticket and make sure all the tickets for our artist shows get sold. We've got a host of services to do that ranging from our own fan club services to Ticketmaster, other specialty ticketing services. So, we support the concept of making sure all the tickets are sold. A lot of the technology development that Michael was just talking about at Ticketmaster is focused on creating more of an open platform and enabling the use of APIs on distributed commerce platform to more effectively sell those tickets. So, we think that we will see and we support the notion going forward, whether it's the artists or the teams, they are looking to retail and use other distribution channels as well to make sure we're selling a ticket in every corner possible.
Rich R. Tullo - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions, this does conclude the Live Nation Entertainment third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Live Nation has continued growing in the second quarter and for the first half, with revenue up 12% and AOI up 6% on a constant currency basis in the second quarter. The increase in revenue was led by our concerts business as we continue attracting more fans to more shows globally, which in turn drives AOI growth in our advertising and ticketing businesses through first half of the year. With the majority of our tickets sold for the year, we are confident that we remain on track to deliver our 2015 plan, and all key leading indicators reinforce our expectations of continued top and bottom-line growth as we build global market share in our core concerts, advertising and ticketing businesses. We have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, bringing 450 million fans in 40 countries to that magical two-hour event each year. Concerts are the flywheel for our high-margin on-site, advertising and ticketing businesses and this year we expect to deliver record operating results, increasing revenue and profitability for each of these businesses. Starting with the concerts business, we have now sold approximately 75% of our projected tickets for the year, and through July we are pacing 7% ahead of last year's ticket sales. This is our top leading indicator that we will increase concert attendance again this year. We continue to be the world's leading promoter for about three-quarters of the top 25 tours, including U2, Imagine Dragons, Luke Bryan, Kid Rock and One Direction. The strength of our global platform continues to deliver growth as we have increased year-on-year attendance. In the second quarter over a million more fans attended our shows. For the full year we expect to grow our fan base by over two million fans, which on its own would be one of the top five promoters in the world. Along with attendance growth, we have also grown per-fan on-site revenue this year by 18% to over $20 per fan in our amphitheaters and festivals as our new sales initiatives, particularly those focused on the high-end fans is paying off. At the same time, we continue building our global platform for the future, most recently adding Marek Lieberberg to establish our concerts business in Germany. Germany is one of the top three concert markets in the world and Marek has a history of promoting more than 700 shows for over two million fans each year. Adding these shows to Live Nation can make us the top promoter in Germany, and moving those two million tickets to the Ticketmaster platform in Germany will substantially increase our scale and market position and ticketing in Germany. With this move, Live Nation now has a promoting presence in all major Western European markets, along with our presence now in nine Asian markets, we are the only promoter able to provide global and regional touring support at scale for artists. Our artist managers continue to provide a strong pipeline of shows to our concerts and sponsorship division. In the sponsorship & advertising business, we have delivered strong growth through the first half, with both revenue and AOI up over 20% on a constant currency basis. Our key leading indicator for advertising, contracted net revenue is up 19% on a constant currency basis as of the end of the second quarter and we have sold 80% of our planned sponsorship for the year. This now gives us confidence that our AOI growth rate in sponsorship & advertising for the year will be in the low teens, an acceleration from recent years. Our online advertising continues to build rapidly, growing revenue by 36% and AOI by over 30% at constant currency for the first half. We now have over 65 million unique monthly visitors to our sites and broader network, making Live Nation one of the top three online music networks. On the content side, we have entered the second year of streaming live shows with Yahoo! Live, with an increased focus on festivals this year, including EDC in Vegas, Wireless and Creamfields in UK and Voodoo in New Orleans. Our Live Nation TV channel with VICE Media is launching this month in beta and to provide live music fans and advertisers a channel dedicated to live music content, delivered by VICE's unique story-telling ability. With the growth of our Festival businesses we are also continuing to build our base of major advertisers, increasing the number of companies that pay us over $1 million a year by 15%, now delivering a collective $200 million to Live Nation in 2015. With all parts of our advertising business now performing and growing rapidly, we expect a record level of AOI growth in 2015, with continued strong runway. Ticketmaster has continued building its global leadership as a ticketing marketplace this year, with 7% growth in traffic leading to a 10% increase in primary and secondary GTV. A key driver behind this growth in site visits and GTV has been our mobile first strategy, building our products for ease of use and viewing on mobile devices. Mobile now consistently accounts for more than half of our traffic, both in North America and internationally. And year-to-date we have deployed 27 updates to our apps globally as we are enhancing the fan experience. As a result, we continue seeing growth in mobile ticket sales, up 21% through the first half, and now accounting for 21% of all ticket sales. Our app install base continues to build as well, now at 19 million, as more fans are seeing the benefit from improved search and ticket management functionality. I am confident that 2015 will mark the true point of conversion of Ticketmaster to a technology company. We have the right leadership and technology teams in place, building a marketplace and delivering products with great fan features while also capturing cost savings for the business. With all this, Ticketmaster has never been better positioned. After growing the business in the first half of the year, we expect 2015 to be another year of growth and record results for the company and we are confident that we will deliver the final year of our three-year plan. Based on the strong position of our leading indicators in concerts and advertising and ticketing, operationally we expect revenue and AOI growth in each of these businesses and overall for Live Nation this year. And more fundamentally, we continue to see a wide set of both organic and acquisition opportunities to further grow each of these businesses beyond 2015, directly building on the success we have achieved to-date. With that, I will turn it over to Joe Berchtold, our COO, for more details.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue in the second quarter was up 14% and AOI was up 9% on a constant currency basis. The revenue growth was driven by a 7% increase in attendance at our shows for the quarter, led by our festivals and arenas. Festival attendance was up 77% for the quarter to over two million fans as we increased the number of festivals in the quarter from 18 to 23 and had some activities shift into Q2 from the third quarter. Arena attendance was up 35% to over five million fans at 600 shows, up from approximately 450 shows in 2014. Looking forward to the second half, we're confident that we will deliver mid-single digit attendance growth and double-digit AOI growth at constant currency for the year. As Michael said, ticket sales for shows this year are up 7% through July, and our pipeline of shows in the second half, particularly the fourth quarter, is very strong and we expect to increase our show volume to about 24,000 this year. At Artist Nation, our Artist Management business, AOI fell in Q2 as we invested to launch new service lines. For the second half, we expect the business to perform more in line with the second half of last year, with timing weighed more to the fourth quarter. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. Revenue for the second quarter grew by 20% and AOI was up by 23% at constant currency, continuing its strong performance from the first quarter. Online advertising was particularly strong, with overall AOI growing 29% at constant currency as we continue to benefit from the structural shift towards digital advertising, particularly advertising targeting millennial audiences. Looking at our different markets, European online grew by about 55% and North America was up about 20%. Sponsorship revenue was up 22% for the quarter at constant currency, with both North America and Europe up consistently and Asia now contributing a material impact on our growth. With over $250 million in sponsorship and advertising now contracted for the year, we're confident enough to increase our expectations for the full year to low-teens AOI growth at constant currency. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster revenue was up 2% and AOI was flat as global GTV increased 6%, all at constant currency. Primary GTV for the quarter was up 4%, with a slight decrease in tickets sold. Recognized ticket fees were negatively impacted by the increase in deferred ticket sales for Live Nation Concerts as seen in our 20% year-on-year increase in event-related deferred revenue, up to over $1 billion. Given the flow-through of these deferred tickets along with the expected on sales, we continue to expect low-single digit growth in primary ticket volume and mid-single digit growth in primary GTV for the year. Secondary GTV was up 38% for the quarter, as we continue to see the success in our strategy of aligning with content and providing fans their full set of choices with transparency. As a result, we are seeing conversion rates on integrated inventory events 30% higher than those with primary-only options. And our volume of events with integrated inventory continues to grow, up another 29% for the quarter. We expect secondary GTV to continue delivering strong growth for the rest of the year, with almost two-thirds of our volume in the second half and the fourth quarter being our largest quarter, given the combination of NFL, NHL and NBA games along with our concert on sales. In addition to this ticketing growth, we have now taken the steps necessary to reduce our cost base and deliver our North American tickets at a cost per ticket that is $0.35 lower than it was in 2012. Overall, based on our ticketing GTV projections combined with cost reductions, we continue to expect to deliver high single-digit AOI growth in ticketing at constant currency for 2015. In summary, now more than halfway through the year, we are confident we will deliver 2015 on plan. With regards to FX, we saw similar results in the second quarter as the first, with revenue impacted by 5% and AOI impacted by about 6%. On timing, we expect Q3 to be largely in line with last year and a strong Q4 across our businesses. Our concerts pipeline for the fourth quarter is quite strong, both in attendance and show count, including tours by Madonna and Janet Jackson in the United States, Maroon 5 in Asia, and U2 in Europe. And as a result, sponsorship & advertising growth looks very solid in the fourth quarter as well. And as we noted with ticketing, our secondary business is seasonably strong in the fourth quarter, and this along with expected on sales for 2016 concerts, makes us confident on the remainder of the year. I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Joe. I will start with our results for the second quarter. Revenue at constant currency is $1.9 billion, up 12% from the same period in 2014. Reported revenue is $1.8 billion. AOI is $151 million at constant currency, up 6% over last year. Reported AOI is $142 million. And free cash flow is $91 million, up 10% compared to last year. At the end of June, our concerts-related deferred revenue, which is the monies we've received to date on tickets sold for events in the future at our owned or operated venues was $1 billion, an increase of 20% over the balance in June of last year of $858 million. Revenue growth for the quarter over last year was driven by higher concerts revenue from increased arena activity in North America and higher festival activity. Reported AOI for the second quarter was in line with last year at $142 million. Total FX impact to AOI for the second quarter was $9 million. Our sponsorship & advertising segment's AOI was up 23% at constant currency, with higher online advertising activity in festival sponsorship. Ticketing AOI was slightly down, with the shift in timing of ticket sales to the first quarter. Concerts AOI was flat to last year, and Artist Nation's AOI was lower as we invested in new service lines. Our operating income for the quarter was $42 million compared with $56 million last year due to higher amortization, primarily related to acquisitions. Net income this quarter was $15 million versus $23 million in 2014, driven by the lower operating income. Free cash flow in the second quarter is $91 million versus $83 million in 2014, driven by timing of interest and tax payments as well as lower distributions to noncontrolling interest partners. Turning to the results for the first half of the year. Revenue at constant currency is up 9% from last year to $3 billion. Reported revenue is $2.9 billion, up 3%. AOI is $225 million at constant currency, in line with last year. And reported AOI is $211 million. And free cash flow is $115 million. Revenue for the first six months was driven by growth in concerts, which delivered over half of the overall increase, up from higher North American arena activity and increased festival activity globally. All of our business segments had higher revenue over last year in the first six months. AOI for the six months was $211 million, as reported. Total FX impact to AOI for the first half was $14 million. Sponsorship & advertising AOI grew 23% at constant currency, with higher online advertising in festival sponsorship. Ticketing AOI was up 7% at constant currency from higher resale ticket sales, and increased primary ticket volume, primarily from concerts. Concerts AOI was impacted by the timing of the mix of shows year-to-date. As Joe noted, we expect higher activity for concerts in the back half of this year as indicated by the 20% increase in deferred revenue. Lastly, Artist Nation's AOI was lower with the investments we're making in additional service line. Operating income was $18 million for the six months compared to $43 million last year due to lower AOI along with higher amortization related to acquisitions. Our net loss in the first six months was $43 million, which was impacted by a $20 million non-cash adjustment to a certain working capital account due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Our normalized net loss excluding that was $23 million compared to a loss of $10 million last year. Free cash flow for the six months is $115 million, in line with last year. Our cash flow from operations was $357 million for the first six months and was up year-over-year, largely because of the increase in deferred revenue. As of June 30, we had cash of $1.5 billion, including $618 million in ticketing client cash and $707 million in net concert event-related cash with a free cash balance of $201 million. Our total capital expenditures year-to-date were $64 million with about a 50% split between maintenance and revenue-generating CapEx. For the full year, we expect that our total capital expenditures will be in line with our previous guidance at around 2% of revenue. As of June 30, our total debt, including capital leases, was $2 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt is 4.3%. Our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of 5 times, and we are comfortably in compliance at below 4 times as of June. We continue to expect that we will deliver on our three-year plan for 2015, with growth in both revenue and AOI on a constant currency basis while we continue to invest in our long-term growth strategies. In summary and all based on constant currency, overall we currently expect AOI for the third quarter to be largely in line with last year, along with a strong fourth quarter across our businesses. We continue to expect double-digit growth in concerts AOI for the year, with increased show activity in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. We expect growth in Sponsorship & Advertising AOI to be in the low teens with the majority of the second half growth driven by a strong fourth quarter. With the projected strength of both primary and resale ticket sales, especially in the fourth quarter, we expect that ticketing will deliver high-single digit AOI growth for the year. And for Artist Nation, we expect AOI for the last half of the year to be more in line with the second half of last year, also more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you and congrats on the quarter. My first question is actually on the concert side. You made several acquisitions and I think in general they're accretive within two and a half years. Can you help us frame the financial impact of your deal with Marek Lieberberg? And now that you're wrapping up your acquisitions in Concerts, C3, Bonnaroo, what other festivals or regions could you expand into? And any thoughts on your latest output agreement with Time for Fun? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: Hey, Amy. It's Joe. Sure, let me try to take those in order. First of all, just looking at the deal with Marek, as we said, Marek has a history of doing over 700 shows and over 2 million fans. So added to our roughly 60 million fans that we have, it's a sizable addition. He's one of the top handful of promoters in the world on a stand-alone basis. So we think it's important both on a stand-alone basis and you can do the math and see the level that it will help increase across our business. But also as importantly, it really rounds out our European Asian market portfolio that lets us do regional and global tours more effectively for artists. So we think it's a key piece to accelerating that overall side of the business.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And let's just note, on MLK, in Germany to-date we basically have Ticketmaster Germany. Because it's an allocated market, we don't have a lot of activity. And generally in Germany overall Live Nation, Ticketmaster is about a negative to a zero business. Adding now this acquisition, which will be accretive day one because of the low cost we were able to attract Marek to come into the network, we get to start that machine now where we've already got a fixed cost base of TM Germany in place. We get to now allocate tickets to our own platform. Historically, when we brought a Madonna and a U2 into Germany, we sold those off to Marek or someone else. Now we get to self-promote. And then once you start self-promoting with tickets, you start to expand your sponsorship base. So we're very, very proud about this deal. We've been working on it a long time. And, Andre, his son, and Marek provide us an instant base business in Germany to build our TM+ – TM business as well as our sponsorship and concerts and grow it from day one.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: And then, Amy, as the second question on what other festivals and regions. As you know, we look at all of this globally, now in more than 40 countries. So we'll continue to look at festivals in Asia and Latin America. As we've also talked broadly, Latin America continues to be a great opportunity. The U.S. as well. We still think that there remain opportunities for us to both build organically and potentially look at additional acquisitions here. So our global market share in concerts we think is in the 30% range and so we globally see great opportunities to continue to expand on that. And then further to your other Latin America question, yes, our output deal with Time for Fun is ending this year. And we are looking extensively at the full set of options we have to further our presence in that market.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And if I could just...
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say that just a – Amy, to add one thing to Joe's comment, our output deal for T4Fun as well as CIE in Mexico have ended this year. So historically, much like the Marek Lieberberg conversation, we sold off our U2 shows and et cetera to either CIE in Mexico and T4Fun in Brazil. We have not renewed either of those deals nor plan on renewing those. We plan on taking our content and establishing a presence in those markets, so again we can start building our ticket, sponsorship and overall business off our content. So whether we do that through an acquisition or a startup, we're exploring all those options. But getting kind of from Canada going down to Mexico into South America, it's obviously a natural routing for the 50-plus tours we buy, so important markets for us to finish the play on, given we're spending lots of content. So...
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then on the ticketing side, you've made several key hires. What kind of tangible benefit should we expect now that you've achieved $0.35 in cost savings? And how's competition with StubHub been trending? Thank you.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: So we don't know how StubHub is doing, so hard to comment specifically on that. I think we've given you a lot of statistics about the growth of our share in the secondary business and our GTV in the secondary business. So we're feeling very good about our product, our service that we're offering to fans and the strength of that in the marketplace. So we have high expectations on continued success and growth in the secondary market. In terms of the ticketing business more broadly, as Michael's talked, our number one focus is continuing to expand that globally with what we're doing in Germany, with what we look to do in Latin America, and continue to scale that business is a key way that we're monetizing our concerts business.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And on Ticketmaster, Amy, we think we just have a ton of runway there. We have a top five global commerce site. Has not historically been anywhere near best-in-class in terms of converting all of that traffic, so a lot of the hires you'll see – we're always going to be centered around our two core missions: a better product and conversion. So whether it's one of our new hires from Virgin Airways who's going to focus around our loyalty and converting that base, or some of the great product people we've hired who are going to continually deliver a more seamless product on our mobile app and our mobile business. So the tangible benefit is I think what we're seeing on a quarterly basis: traffic up, conversion up, GTV up. To get all of those up, we know that we got to deliver a better product ongoing with the robust roadmap. I think we mentioned today that we had 27 updates to our mobile app, so we're very serious about having a best-in-class mobile experience from the minute you find out about that show to the digital ecosystem throughout. And we got to make sure that our conversion gets better and better as that massive traffic's coming through our door through mobile or on desktop, we want to make sure we know more about you. We've talked a lot about our sales force and our CRM strategy, really mining that data of all those customers that have either come before or are new to our site, offering them a better experience and ultimately converting them over time. So a lot of the hires or anything you see we do is all geared toward either better product and ultimately higher conversion against a very high traffic base that we currently have and the tangible benefits we'll see on continual GTV and traffic usage.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI: Thank you. A few clarifications, please. I was just wondering how long it would take for Marek Lieberberg to get up to that 700 show kind of run rate? And secondly, free cash dipped sequentially, I was wondering how much of that was due to acquisitions like Bonnaroo or anything else you could talk to and anything else that would have impacted that? Thanks.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So in terms of MLK getting up to speed, we expect it to be pretty quick. We announced it mid-year so that we made sure that as we're thinking about our tours that we're lining up for next year, that we're taking that into account that we'll have a German position to self-promote. That will obviously focus on the biggest stadium/arena-type shows, so I think we'll very quickly in the next year drive the bulk of that fan base. And then again he's up and running January 1, and the smaller shows tend to have a shorter lead time. So we would expect vast, vast mass majority of that hitting next year and then fully up to speed by 2017.
Kathy Willard - Chief Financial Officer: And then, David, on the free cash question, it's driven by acquisitions at about $60 million, and then the other big driver that is just continued advances for those artists and ticketing clients as we continue to grow the future of the business.
David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI: Thanks. And on the strong online advertising growth, how can you help us think about how much the Yahoo!'s streaming of live shows has contributed to that?
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: I think on a year-on-year basis, that's not a substantial growth contributor, given the timing of when the show started.
David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI: Okay. And how much longer do you have with the Yahoo! contract? Is that something that could be up for better economics, anything you can talk about there?
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we will continue to renew that on an annual basis, and as you can see this year, we were able to expand our content offering by increasing our festival presence. And I think by this point now, we have attracted a good audience and proof of concept that would let you know that there are many other advertisers or streaming platforms that are interested and excited about these opportunities still. We'll remain with Yahoo! as long as the economics work for both of us and we think this is a viable business going forward.
David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI: Thanks. And just one final question, if there's any update on when you'll be able to roll off the old Ticketmaster systems post-replatforming. Thank you.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, David, as we've talked about over the past year or so, the way that the evolution is working is on a modular basis. So we're replacing substantial portions of the system as we go along. I think that by certainly end of the year, you'll see again the vast, vast majority of the underlying technology, particularly on our Concerts business, has been replaced. A lot of it's not going to be visible to you, the consumer, because it's the back office plumbing.
David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Janedis at Jefferies. Please go ahead.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thank you. I think there's a lot of interest in the VICE channel. Can you help us frame the upfront investment? Are you assuming an impact on digital advertising in the outlook? And over the long term, will that change the margin trajectory in the segment? Thank you.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right, I'll try to step back. So let's get back to the strategy. As we've outlined, our first job over the last couple years was to consolidate and build our global platform from a digital basis. So now with over 65 million uniques on a digital basis, we have a wide platform. Obviously like anyone else in digital advertising, the advertisers are looking for more and more sticky content that we could create to satisfy their needs. Yahoo! was our first toe in the water to validate that we could deliver that. And now VICE will be that next evolution, where we'll launch a start-up channel, we'll have lots of content, original programming, all based around the Live Music business. And we think it's absolutely all incremental new advertising to our platform. It'll be a new channel. We'll have multiple distribution points. And as we get the combination of the content right with the distribution right, we just think it's all incremental eyeballs and advertising to our current base business. John, does that give you a good basis?
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Yeah, that does. Thanks. But just in terms of – I'm just thinking about the model. Anything upfront we should be thinking? Meaning is this a single-digit million kind of investment? Is it low-double? Is there anything you can help there? It would be useful I think for modeling.
Michael Rapino - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we hope to because it's an – we assume like the Yahoo! Model, the investment ultimately gets recouped within that same year by the advertisers. So Yahoo! was a multi-million dollar investment to stage all those shows annually and we've been able with Yahoo! to deliver a profit against that business. We look at VICE in a similar fashion. There's a start-up cost to create some new content, but we believe that through distribution once we get rolling over the next six months and the eyeballs are delivered, that we'll be netting ourselves incremental AOI, advertising and digital next year from this.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Arthur at Huber Research. Please go ahead.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Yeah. Thanks. I guess three questions. Question one, I'm not quite used to such a big emphasis on the fourth quarter to make the year numbers. I get the Ticketmaster timing thing. But what are you seeing in the concert business for the third quarter that gives you a little pause? The second question, international attendance. It was down a fair amount in 2014 but the events were down. Now the events are up, but the attendance is still down. Is that just mix? If you could clarify that. And then, Kathy, on your statement about Artist Nation in the second half, are you saying in line with last year results or in line with the growth of last year's results? Thanks.
Joe Berchtold - Chief Operating Officer: So, Doug, this is Joe. Let me take those. So first of all, there's nothing giving us pause on Q3. I don't think we've said that. What we said is that our line-up for Q4, on a Q4 to Q4 basis, is particularly strong. I gave you some examples of the shows that we have. It just so happens that from a timing of touring perspective, this year our show counts and our expectations for attendance in Q4 are quite strong. As we said our tickets sold for shows occurring this year is up 7% for the year, so that gives us a strong underlying level of confidence in where we end up strongly with growth in global attendance at our shows, so just trying to give you the timing of that Q3 to Q4 where a lot of that is coming from that we're seeing. In terms of the specifics on the international side, yes it's simply a type of show mix that we have, fewer stadium shows this year but a very strong arena and festival line-up, so you're just seeing some show mix there. But again globally our expectations are both North America and international, fan growth for the full year. You're obviously also seeing the impact coming out of Europe of FX at the percentages that I told you. And then specifically as it relates to Artist Nation, the comment was that for the second half that the overall results are more in line with what the overall results were last year for the second half. We've been investing in scaling that business, adding some new service lines. As we've often talked about for our Artist Nation business, the most critical aspect of it is that it's aligned with and feeds our concerts and sponsorship business that drives the scale that we have there. We've had great success in terms of building our share and show count with all of the artists in Artist Nation because of the value that we're delivering for them from the core businesses, so our focus is very highly on building that business in an alignment with the rest of the businesses, so just trying to give you some specifics on where we think that's going in the second half.
Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment second quarter 2015 earnings conference call.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Terry Steeling [ph] and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements relating to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation for the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release, reconciliations and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Investor Relations tab on investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino: Thank you and welcome to our call. Live Nation has continued growing its business in 2015, with first quarter revenue up 4% on a constant currency basis, led by strong growth in our Ticketing business. More importantly, four months into the year, we now have enough data from leading indicators to be confident that we remain on track to deliver our 2015 plan, with continued top and bottom line growth, as we build global market share in our core Concerts, Advertising and Ticketing businesses. We have built the industry's most scalable and unparalleled live platform, bringing 400 million fans together to that magical two-hour event. Concerts remain a strong flywheel for our high-margin on-site, Advertising and Ticketing business. And this year, we expect to deliver record operating results by growing each of these businesses. Starting with our concerts business, we have now sold approximately half of our projected tickets for the year, and through April we are pacing 4% ahead of last year’s ticket sales. We continue to be the world’s leading promoter with approximately 20 of the top 25 global tours, including U2, Maroon 5, Luke Bryan and Ariana Grande. Along with attendance growth, we are also expecting to grow on-site revenue this year, as our sales initiatives focusing on the high-end fans continue to pay off. At the same time, we are expanding our global footprint, most recently, with the acquisition of the Bonnaroo Music Festival, which advances our position in the North American festival market. In 2012, we had none of the top five festivals, we now have four of the top five. Overall now, we have 68 festivals, with 5 million fans, making Live Nation the largest global festival producer. Given their strong appeal with fans and artists, we see festivals as an important high-margin growth channel on a global basis, providing the most cost effective platform for monetizing fans across advertising, on-site and Ticketing. And our Artist Nation division continues to attract new clients and continues to be a strong feeder to our core Concerts business. In Sponsorship & Advertising business, we again grew at a double-digit pace, with over 20% growth in both revenue and AOI this quarter on a constant currency basis. Contracted net revenue is up 17% at the end of the first quarter, and we have now sold over 70% of our planned advertising for the year, putting us ahead of schedule. This gives us confidence that we will continue growing our AOI in advertising at double-digit rates. Through the first part of the year, we have made great progress building our advertising scale and for the first time, comScore has ranked us as the third largest music focused advertiser network in the United States with over 60 million unique visitors a month. This firmly establishes Live Nation as one of the advertising platforms of choice in music, which we believe will now help accelerate our ad sales growth. Our content strategy is also advancing with the renewal of our Live Nation Channel on Yahoo! Live and also expanding into streaming of festivals on the channel. And we are on schedule to launch our Live Nation television channel with VICE later this summer.  We also refer to building our base of major advertising clients with a 10% increase in the number of companies that pay us over $1 million a year and a corresponding 18% expected increase in revenue from these clients. With all these pieces coming together, Live Nation is better positioned than ever to continue building its advertising business.  Ticketmaster continued to build on its global leadership as a ticket marketplace this quarter, benefiting from product improvements and increased conversion rates as we increased our global share with a 14% growth in site visits, driving an 8% increase in combined primary and secondary Gross Transaction Value. As a result, during the quarter we had three of the top ticket sales base in Ticketmaster's history. We have deployed a number of mobile product enhancements during the quarter, improving the mobile responsiveness of our websites, increasing the functionality to buy, transfer, and resell tickets and enter venues with our apps. As a result, we are rapidly growing our mobile business, with a 20% increase in mobile visits and a 35% increase in mobile ticket sales. We are seeing rapid adoption of our mobile apps, up 43% from the first quarter over 2014 to over 17 million installs at the end of the first quarter this year.  Looking ahead, we are optimistic that these trends will continue and accelerate as we improve our online mobile and API products to continue increasing the inventory of Ticketmaster's marketplace. In summary, 2015 is shaping up to be another year of growth and record results for the company, and we remain confident we will deliver the final year of our three-year plan. With strong leading indicators in Concerts, Advertising, and Ticketing, operationally we expect revenue and AOI growth in each of these businesses and overall for Live Nation this year. And more fundamentally, we continue to see a wide set of both organic and acquisition opportunities to continue growing each of our businesses beyond 2015, directly building on the success we achieved to date. With that, I'll pass it over to my COO, Joe Berchtold, who will take you through some of the divisional details.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, Concerts. Revenue for the quarter was flat on a constant currency basis and AOI was down due to a decline in attendance, which was expected coming off a high level of Q1 arena activity last year.  Given Q1 is traditionally our slowest quarter in Concerts, what matters most at this point of the year is our pipeline shows and ticket sold to date for shows occurring this year. Our show count for the full year is tracking towards mid-single-digit growth rate, led by double-digit growth in our arena shows. And as Michael said, ticket sales for shows occurring this year are up 4% through last Friday, setting us up for lower to mid single-digit growth in attendance this year. And based on these indicators, we expect to deliver double-digit AOI growth in Concerts for the year. At Artist Nation AOI fell in Q1, but this swing reflects the fluctuations and timing inherence in the business and we continue to expect solid performance through the rest of the year, keeping us largely in line with last year's results. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business, revenue of constant currency grew by 22% and AOI grew by 20% for the quarter. Online activity in North America was particularly strong, growing AOI 35% with major clients, including Pepsi, Hilton, Pennzoil, and Paramount Pictures. In our emerging markets, AOI more than doubled in the quarter, led by Thailand, Korea and Australia. And with this start to the year along with the growth in contracted net revenue, we are confident we will grow Sponsorship & Advertising AOI by double-digits this year. Finally, Ticketmaster, for the quarter Ticketmaster revenue at constant currency was up 11% and AOI was up 16%. Primary ticketing GTV was up 4% for the quarter led by strong concert ticket sales which drove double-digit growth in March. In secondary ticketing, we are now active in 13 countries. We increase the number of events activated on TM+ by 150% and as a result drove secondary GTV up by 75% for the quarter. Along with this ticketing growth, we continue to make progress on our cost reduction program and remain confident on our operating costs for North America ticket in 2015 will be at least $0.35 lower than it was in 2012. So based on ticket sales at this point in the year, we expect to have low single-digit growth in primary ticketing and double-digit growth in secondary ticketing in 2015. And with this ticketing volume, along with our cost reductions, we expect to deliver high single-digit AOI growth in Ticketing for the year. So, in summary, four months into the year, we feel very good about delivering 2015 on plan with regards to timing. Looking at Q2, we expect AOI performance as a percentage of full year AOI to be largely in line with 2014, which puts our overall AOI a bit more into the second half this year relative to last year. And finally, on FX impact during the first quarter, we saw revenue impacted by about 5% and AOI impacted by roughly 6%. I will now turn the call over to Kathy Willard to go through more on our financial results. 
Kathy Willard: Thanks, Joe and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by summarizing our key financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue at constant currency is up 4% to $1.2 billion and flat as recorded at $1.1 billion. AOI is $73.9 million at constant currency and $69.6 million as recorded and free cash flow is $24 million. One of our most important leading financial indicators is our Concerts related deferred revenue, which is the monies we've received to date on tickets sold for events in feature at owned or operated venue. At the end of the first quarter, this deferred revenue was $919 million, an increase of 4% over the balance in March of last year of $885 million. Overall, revenue for the first quarter was driven by growth in Ticketing with both primary and secondary delivering strong results year-over-year. Concerts revenue was impacted in the quarter with the shift in arena activity as compared to last year as we discussed at year-end. The timing of concerts arena activity is also the main driver of our adjusted operating income results overall for the first quarter of 2015. As Concerts AOI for the quarter was a loss of $12 million compared to a $3 million loss for the same period last year. And as Joe noted, both our Ticketing and Sponsorship & Advertising businesses delivered higher AOI this quarter. During the first quarter of 2015, we reported an operating loss of $24 million compared to $12 million loss last year from our AOI results including the $4 million impact to foreign exchange rates declined this year. Net loss for the quarter was $58 million versus loss of $32 million last year, driven by a $21 million non-cash adjustment to certain working capital accounts, based on changes in the exchange rate. Free cash flow was $24 million this quarter compared to $35 million in the first quarter of 2014. This is due to our AOI results along with the $7 million increase in maintenance capital expenditures associated with point-of-sale enhancements to our venues and timing of other spend this year. Cash flow from operations was $343 million through March and was impacted by higher payments for event related expenses for shows later in the year as compared to last year. As of March 31, we had total cash of $1.6 billion, this includes $608 million in Ticketing client cash and $638 million in net concert event related cash, driven by our higher deferred revenue. Our free cash was $360 million. Our total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $26 million compared to $21 million last year. We spent $60 million on maintenance items and $10 million on revenue generating additions. We expect that our total capital expenditures for 2015 will be in line with the guidance we have previously given at approximately 2% of revenue. As of March 31st, our total current and long-term debt, including capital leases, was $2 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.3%. And our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of five times, and we're comfortably in compliance at below four times as of March. For the full year, we expect to drive growth operationally across each of our businesses in both revenue and AOI, while continuing to invest in our long-term growth strategies. In summary, we currently expect AOI for the second quarter to be consistent with last year as a percentage of full year AOI with more growth in 2015 coming in the second half of the year as Joe noted. We expect to deliver double-digit growth in Concerts AOI. The growth trend in Sponsorship & Advertising AOI is expected to continue and to deliver double-digit growth again in 2015. In Ticketing, we expect high single-digit AOI growth overall for the year. And Artist Nation AOI is anticipated to be in line with last year. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Amy Yong with Macquarie Capital.
Amy Yong: Thanks. Congratulations. I have a really quick question just on the acquisitions that you've been making, and perhaps how we should think about their accretion going forward. So just thinking about C3 and Bonnaroo, and -- how should we think about the top and bottom line synergies on these two acquisitions alone? And I guess now that you have four of the five top brands in the U.S., should we expect more acquisitions internationally or perhaps other areas? If you could just help us think through kind of geographic expansion, that would be great.
Michael Rapino: Thank you. This is Michael. Hi, Amy. In our investor presentations in the Liberty once in the fall time, I think now at least for the three years, we've always put up this kind of this global festival slide where we've shown the top 20 festivals in the European market and in America. And we've been pretty clear that festivals are a high margin, great channel to be in. We currently have always had a very strong presence in Europe, been the leader in festivals, T in the Park and Reading and Leeds and Lowlands of Holland and the list goes on. We're a little underdeveloped in America, probably because we focused a little too long on our amphitheaters. So, we over the last three years had a mission to make sure that we could fill that hole in an area where we have undeveloped market share. So, Insomniac, C3, a bunch of organic festivals in the country we started and now Bonnaroo. So, we look at the festivals from an acquisition perspective. They are a tough business to kind of organically get from zero to 80,000 people like Bonnaroo. You can waste a lot of money and fail a few times trying to get that magic in a bottle. So, we really look at the -- on a global basis, there is about 25, 30 festivals where they just become kind of iconic. Rock in Rio in Brazil, Fuji Festival in Fuji, and some of the ones we've acquired. So, we're always on the look on any of these marquee global festivals. If we think that buying that festival is a better return on capital, we've been trying to start two or three of them and making our way to that level. We know that buying these ones tend to be a better and shorter return on capital been trying to build them. Now for us we take an asset like Bonnaroo or Electric Daisy, once we plug that into our Ticketing platform, plug it into our Yahoo! platform like we just did with one of the C3 festivals and plug it into with our Advertising business, we've had great success taking those business and making them very accretive very fast and increasing AOI in those businesses by kind of bringing some scale and professional management and advertising to them and growing them at double-digit rates kind of another first couple years. So, we think we have a strong global portfolio. We will be opportunistic if we think there's other ones available that we can add to our platform. And if we think we can buy them and effectively add our synergies and make them instantly accretive acquisitions, we think those are good opportunities we will continue to pursue. But we would not be as kind of desperate as we were three years ago when we were sitting here with a very underdeveloped U.S. platform the sponsors and our Ticketmaster business were kind of yelling that we needed to get into. So, we're proud and happy with our current portfolio. And we find these very accretive acquisitions given that we get to scale them across our synergistic platforms.
Amy Yong: Perfect. And then Joe, just thinking about Ticketmaster a little bit more, as you start gaining share on the secondary side and start reaping some of the cost savings, how do we think about longer term margins for that business?
Joe Berchtold: Amy, sure. I mean, as we talked structurally and fundamentally, the secondary business has economics that are pretty consistent with the primary business. Obviously, when it's been a lower scale, it's been working its way back up toward primary. But in that same range, I would say is how you should think about the secondary business as it gets to a level of scale.
Amy Yong: Got it. And on the cost savings side?
Joe Berchtold: Sure. On a cost savings side, that's largely associated with our primary ticketing platform. So it's really those ticketing -- those tickets that the operating costs come out of.
Amy Yong: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies.
John Janedis: Thank you. Can you guys talk a little bit more about sponsorships? Is the driver of growth digital, or is it much broader? And are you anywhere near having any kind of capacity issues?
Michael Rapino: Thanks, John. Our businesses, at the end of the day has been an ad business that we continue to look at elevating our ad units. Originally, we were just an on-site kind of sponsorship business. If you were a major advertiser and you wanted to touch consumers on-site, we were kind of your best slot. Then we turned and built as our scale delivered outside of amphitheaters and more globally, we started to develop a commerce and digital business. So, at this current state, when we’re talking to Madison Avenue, it’s couple combinations. First and foremost, we’re just a great now digital network to make an advertising buy-on, if you want to reach this demo with our scale. We have lots of inventory available still. We look at all of our assets and what is still available. And we have great runway ahead of us to continue to monetize a lot of unused ad units. A lot of the ad units are also a combination of on-site and digital, where most of our bigger deals our holistic programs where an advertiser is looking to launch a program, have a kind of a global or a large reach to our platform, but then really make it come to life like American Express does by delivering absolute direct value to access to concerts to their customer. So, we sell local, we sell regional, and we sell digital. We’re seeing -- as everyone else is, we’re very, very excited that our business is moving to mobile. We’re keeping that audience and like everyone else, are looking at all ways that mobile advertising will continue to be a big part of our next new ad unit. So we see lots of inventory available. We have now the reach on-site of over the 60 million customers that advertisers want to be associated with. And now with the 60 million plus on a digital basis, we are able to sale local sponsorship, national access and digital reach programs with capacity left on all of those.
John Janedis: Thanks. And maybe separately, you touched on mobile. I was hoping to dig a little deeper in terms of the mobile app. How many more shows do app users attend compared to non-app users? And over time, can we see much of a margin benefit as a result?
Joe Berchtold: So, John, this is Joe. We haven’t released any details on the specific segments for folks that we have in terms of how they do their purchasing. So I can’t get into that right now. On the economics -- our economics are the same whether somebody buys online or via app, both of those are obviously lower cost than more direct methods of sale. But our economics are the same, service fees are the same, margins are the same.
John Janedis: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question comes from John Tinker with Maxim Group.
John Tinker: Thanks. Two brief questions. One, could you just touch on Artist Nation and the increase in SG&A? So that was the negative comp, and talk about that a little. And, secondly, in the fast moving world of music streaming, can you just give us your views on where that’s going and how you’re involved because you still have a relationship with Jay Z, but he’s buying Tidal, and exactly how you fit into that?
Michael Rapino: You’re good, Tinker. Yeah, we will stick to our knitting right now. We support Jay and all of our artists and any of their endeavors. And we will do everything we can to help Jay succeed and those artists. But we think we have a great runway ahead of us just doing exactly what our core business is. On a global basis, we have lots of opportunities to scale and continue to grow our concert business, new ticket markets, new ticket products, and then later on the advertising on top of that. So we think that our best strategy is to use our resources to keep right down the fairway, continue to consolidate and organically grow our core business. And we will leave the streaming hardware to others right now, and we'll worry about selling concert tickets.  One of the advantages of Ticketmaster and our new platform we've been working on, obviously, Ticketmaster Plus was the first new product that we were able to introduce having a more robust platform. But we do also look at a lot of these opportunities with Apple and others that we now have a platform with an API and an ability to distribute a buy button. So we look at some of these streaming sites just as great distribution outlets that we currently will either have an affiliate or a buy button strategy to increase our reach and increase our conversion, but not a core business that we would be looking to tackle at this point.
A – Kathy Willard: And John, on your first question on Artist Nation SG&A, that's really driven by the fact that we've been adding some key managers to the business, and so it's just timing of those costs coming in versus when the artist -- the activity is coming in from the artist in terms of commission.
Q – John Tinker: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Joyce with Evercore ISI.
Q – David Joyce: Thank you. I was wondering on the sponsorship front, what portion is strategic at this point, meaning revenue that’s likely straight line versus event correlated, and how should we think about that trending as you expand your platform globally?
A – Joe Berchtold: So, David, this is Joe. We talked at the end of year that roughly $200 million in revenue was coming from our largest relationships, which meant over $1 million per year in revenue from those relationships. Those relationships generally now withstand the gamut. As Michael was talking, as we take the combination of the 60 million fans that go to our shows and the 60 million unique, so most of those folks are doing a combination of digital and traditional sponsorship. I think you can take from the magnitude of those relationships. There is some steadiness to them, but, certainly, it's not all contracted revenue with those folks.
Q – David Joyce: Thanks. And on the Ticketing front, how much of -- the margins were better than we thought this quarter, how much of that is due to the replatforming expense saving may be happening a little sooner than your year-end plan versus just your volumes increasing, so some of good operational leverage. 
A – Joe Berchtold: Yes, it was exactly both of those things, David. As I alluded to, we had a very good March, a little better than we were sitting here talking to you at the end of February than we knew it was going to be. So there was some volume pick up their relative to expectation, and, yes, we are doing great on getting the cost savings and that's in part why we are confident. We'll have it fully in place this year.
Q – David Joyce: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Ben Mogil with Stifel.
Q – Benjamin Mogil: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow up on Amy's question, and Michael, you were talking about the festival business, and your comment that you can burn through a lot of money trying to get a festival started, and we've certainly seen that. When you look at festivals you've bought and when you look at festival business, in general, there's been some high-profile expansions where people went to a second weekend and that didn't work out or people took a festival that was in city A and moved it to city B and that didn't work out. Generally speaking, are you finding that people are too ambitious about their festival expansion? Are you finding that some festivals are one weekend is good enough? Curious your views on how scalable some festivals are?
A – Michael Rapino: There is no one right answer here. I mean, Festivals range small city one up to big ones and they may look easy to replicate and grow, but it's not that simple. We look at Festivals at the end of the day, there are hundreds of little Festivals happening at all times that are generally a labor of love, not generally much of a real business. Our business at the end of the day on a global basis is we like those Festivals with scale, 30,000 plus. Obviously, because then they become truly advertising units and also most of where the talent leverage we have is on that end. So, you know, I think if anything, lots of people out there as Festival producers, very few make it to the top of the Bonnaroo, C3, Coachella, Insomniac level. And we think those are the ones that we want to be participating in and provide us the best return on our capital. And we generally don't look to launch and take a lot of risk every year on launching a lot of them. We organically launched three or four every year in a very structure risk adverse manner. Seeing if we can self brew some of them. But at this point, it's an expensive game to scale from scratch. And given we already own 60 for many years in our European platform, adding on a few quality high-profile ones in our U.S. platform was just kind of a continuation of a long strategy we started in Europe. I would not want to be sitting here today trying to figure out how to buy and/or build 60 festivals with over 5 million customers. That would be a very expensive proposition. 
Q – Benjamin Mogil: And going through the C3 deal and the Bonnaroo deal, do you see the M&A environment, because of the changes with AEG and what SFX is going through, its privatization, do you see the environment as a buyer, better, if you will?
A – Michael Rapino: You know, I think with built a fairly unique global business at this point. We tend not to chase deals. We tend whether it's a management company or in the case of Superfly and I think their comments they mentioned this week to the press. We tend to believe we are a place where an entrepreneur who maybe has already had some success. When looking at the scale that we can bring to their resources can take Bonnaroo, C3 or Insomniac to new levels, we kind of think we're in a unique class in that point. So whether it was Insomniac or C-3 or Bonnaroo, I would I don’t think in any case if there was much of a bidding war. I think others were interested, but I think those founders believe that we probably could provide the best opportunity to grow their businesses and using our assets. 
Q – Benjamin Mogil: That's great, Michael. Thanks for the color. 
Operator: And we’ll take our final question today from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company.
Q – Rich Tullo: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Nice quarter. My question is, what percentage or if you could provide a little color on the ads and sponsorships, is derived from the website and content deals versus what we would call traditional, if that exists, sponsorship in the concert business? And just a little follow-up on the VICE TV, is that a YouTube channel or a traditional cable TV channel?
A – Joe Berchtold: So, Rich, this is Joe. On the sponsorship versus online, we talked at the end of last year on those numbers, it was roughly two-thirds, call it, sponsorship, traditional delivery, and about one-third of it was online, to give you the general mix. And in terms of the VICE Channel, we have not -- we haven't announced exactly how that Channel will be distributed, so those announcements will be coming up over the next month or so and it will be launched this summer.
Q – Rich Tullo: And is there any way to provide a little color on the growth of the online product versus anything else, because I would suspect that, that is growing, excluding the lift from sponsorships, is growing quite fast?
A – Joe Berchtold: Yeah. No, I gave you my numbers that North America online was up about 35% AOI. So, yes, online is growing strongly. As Michael said, we've also built a network of over 60 million unique, and that brings us into a whole another class with Madison Avenue and top three music related sites. So we absolutely expect some good portion of our growth will be driven by the online this year.
Q – Rich Tullo: Thank you.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2014 conference call. Live Nation continues to be the global in the live event industry with another record year. In 2014 the company grew AOI by 10%, revenue by 6% and free cash flow by 9%. We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong consumer global demand. Live is truly a unique entertainment form it cannot be duplicated, it is elevated not threatened by technology and it’s borderless. Fans around the world can now discover, follow, share and artist creating a greater demand for live shows. Technology is also transforming ticketing. Ticket sales are continuing the rapid shift to mobile with 35% growth in 2014 to 18% of total ticket sales leading to a higher fan engagement conversion and a better purchase flow. We believe the Live business will continue to have a strong growth for years to come, as connected fans drive demands, artist are motivated to tour and mobile technology drives conversion. Starting with our Concert division, in 2014 we built on a record 2013 are growing concert's revenue 5%. We again grew our global market share as we promoted the majority of 22 to the top 25 global tours. At the same time, we continue to expand our global footprint in the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia while also building our portfolio of marquee festival assets with the acquisition of Austin City Limits and Lollapalooza. Our Artist Management Business, AOI grew by 50% as we attracted more managers to Live Nation including U2, Madonna, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Britney Spears, Alicia Keys. And it drives our Concert business as Live Nation promoted over 700 shows in 2014 more than double that of 2012 with a high percentage of these artist activating TN plus. For this expanded concert base, we again grew our advertising business at a double-digit pace to 10% increase in AOI for the year and our highest margin business at over 70%. And our online business AOI grew even faster at 15%. This growth was driven by two initiatives. First, we’ve remained focused on growing our fan network, increasing traffic by 17% for a total of over one billion visitors throughout the year. And second, we’re not monetizing our content, notably our deal with Yahoo to stream our live concert everyday, which has driven increased interest by advertisers to our online platform to have an incremental business. Yahoo and Live are just the beginning of our entry into the media space, driving advertising with high-quality, live music related video offerings that will continue to expand and drive advertising growth. Our unique ad platform has enabled us to attract new strategic sponsors such as Pepsi, Coke and SAP last year. With these additions, we now have approximately 60 companies that spend over $1 million each year on the Live Nation platform driving over $200 million in revenue and additional 700 companies that also advertise on our platform generating over $300 million in sales revenue. We believe, we can continue to up-sell and convert these 700 sponsors as we grow our average deal size. Ticketmaster continue to build on its global leadership with the introduction of new products that instantly scale on Ticketmaster’s platform and drive revenue. In 2014 these new products help drive a 7% increase in gross transaction value of primary tickets to $23 billion and a 55% increase in secondary GTV. Our most successful new product launch has been Ticketmaster Plus with over $1 billion of secondary GTV since its launch in the fall of 2013. The number of events activated in 2014 increased 500% to 10,000 events listed on Ticketmaster. Secondary growth for concerts in particular has been very strong with 350% year-on-year increase, demonstrating how Ticketmaster can leverage Live Nation concerts as a top customer to immediately establish scale and new products. And despite the strong growth, only 6% of our Ticketmaster event 2014 were activated with secondary inventory. So we have substantial run rate for growth ahead. At the same time we have shifted our product focus for event discovery, purchase and ticket management to mobile. As a result in the fourth quarter of 2014 for the first time, we have more visitors to our mobile sites than desktop. There remains tremendous growth opportunity for Ticketmaster traffic and conversion. The shift to mobile will more effectively link fans with shows and Ticketmaster’s ability to drive mobile app installation as it continues to be the number one place to discover and buy tickets. Our commitment to our venue client is surprise them with the best service and products in the industry, and this continues to bare out as we achieved the net renewal rate of over 100% for the fifth straight year. In addition to enabling better products as a result of our technology investments we were also lowering our operating cost. And by the end of 2014, we reduced our cost per ticket in North America by almost $0.25 per ticket ahead of our planned time table. Demonstrating Ticketmaster's low cost business it had the second biggest sales day in its 30-year history last Friday selling over one million tickets. The top day four years ago and we expect this year to be like that. We’re confident that our business model and it’s scale provides ongoing growth potential during these continued opportunities to consolidate global concert business and we’ll use that scale to start drive fan monetization, advertising, and ticketing. In 2012 we've grown revenue by 18% AOI by 20%, and cash flow by 31%. Looking forward to see this growth of sustainable and repeatable given the breadth of believers and friends working for us. With that I’ll turn it over to Joe, who will take you through additional detail.
Joe Berchtold: Hey Michael. Looking first at our concerts business segment for the full year looking at the specific markets in North America attendance grew by 6% to our 40 million fans with show count of 2%, and attendance per show of 3%. While the amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and clubs all attracted more fans in 2014 stadiums were the strongest driver of fan growth with a record 76 stadium shows led by sellout tours with One Direction, Jay-Z, and Beyonce, Rihanna and Eminem. Internationally, attendance declined by 14%, which we believe was simply a matter of tour cycles and geographic mix with nothing to indicate any consumer issues. The attendance decline came from arenas and stadiums, which both experienced a substantial drop in show count. Notwithstanding the show count decline, our attendance per show at both arenas and stadiums was up for the year 1% and 7% respectively and globally our festivals continue to be a solid growth driver of 9% to almost five million fans. Looking at the fourth quarter, our results reflected a significant drop in arena shows and shift of activity to the third quarter that we previously indicated would be happening. If you look at the aggregate numbers we have 20% of our concerts revenue in Q4 this year versus 24% in each to the past two years. Again consistent with our previous projections of a shift in activity through the third quarter due to stadium activity and arenas timing. As a result we had 41% of our concert revenue in the third quarter of 2014 up from 37% or 38% in the past few years. As we look to 2015, our ticket sales so far this year remain on pace with last year and we expect the global touring pipeline to be at least as strong as it was in 2014 albeit with a return to a more traditional balance of stadium and arena shows. And in particular we expect our international markets to see material increase in touring activity. Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business, our sponsorship and advertising business delivered 5% revenue and 10% AOI growth for the year closing with a very strong fourth quarter that grew AOI by 24%. As we look to 2015, through the end of January, we had double-digit growth and confirmed bookings for those sponsors and advertisers and as a result for 2015 we expect to continue delivering AOI growth at historical levels for the business. For the year, Ticketmaster revenue was up 11%, while AOI was up 9% and for the fourth quarter, our revenue was up 15% and AOI up 16%. In primary ticketing, Ticketmaster benefited from a further acceleration of concert on sales into Q4. As a point of comparison, 29% of total concert ticket sold at Ticketmaster in the year were sold in the fourth quarter of 2014 up from the more typical 26% to 27% for the past few years. In secondary ticketing we saw an acceleration of our GTV growth in the fourth quarter, driven particularly by the NFL concerts in our international markets. And as Michael noted, with our cost savings programs, we were able to drive our fourth quarter cost to achieve an almost $0.25 per ticket cumulative reduction in operating cost for our North America tickets. And through all this we continued our technology investments for future products, which we expect to be the norm for this business going forward. Based on ticket sales through the first six weeks of the year, in 2015 we expect to have low single-digit growth in primary tickets and ongoing double-digit growth in secondary ticketing. And as a result, we expect to continue the trajectory we’ve been on with highest single-digit AOI growth in 2015. So in summary, as we look to 2015, we remain confident we will deliver our three-year plan as we’ve laid out. A few points to note, first from a phasing standpoint we expect the third quarter to continue growing in its size as a percent of full year AOI. On the other hand, we expect that first quarter will return to generating its share of AOI more in line with what we saw in 2011 through 2013 as opposed to the spike we saw in Q1 last year. Secondly, on FX rate, given our 2015 was obviously set based on 2014 actuals, our revenue in AOI are both about two third U.S. dollar denominated and a one third mix of Euro, Pound, Canadian dollar and all other currencies in net order. In 2014 currency fluctuations did not have a major impact on our results about 1% of AOI. Part of the reason we haven’t been impacted much is because we hedge our cost exposure against our revenue base. So our exposure is mainly in the value of profits we bring home from overseas, not in our actual cost of goods versus our revenue and obviously over the past few months, currency fluctuations have been much more volatile with risk of greater impacts in 2015. But at this point we feel very good about the underlying operating strength of the businesses around the world and see these fluctuations simply a cyclical point in time and not reflective of anything structural in the business. I'll turn the call over to Kathy now to go through more on our financial results.
Kathy Willard: Thanks Joe and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by summarizing our key financial highlights for the year. Revenue was up 6% to $6.9 billion. AOI is up 10% to $555 million and free cash flow is up 9% to $327 million and in addition our concerts related deferred revenue at yearend is up 7% to $464 million. Now let me take you through some more other details. Revenue for the full year was $6.9 billion, up 6% over last year's $6.5 billion. All of our segments delivered revenue growth for the year, with the largest growth coming from concerts, up 5% and ticketing up 11%. Adjusted operating income in 2014 grew 10% to $555 million, compared to $505 million last year. Concerts AOI was $51 million, compared to $60 million in 2013, due to fewer stadium and arena shows internationally. Sponsorship and advertising's AOI grew 10% to $213 million from the higher online advertising and growth in sponsorship. Ticketing delivered AOI of $326 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year, due to increased primary and secondary ticket sales. And Artist Nation AOI was $48 million, a 50% growth from the $32 million in 2013, driven by higher management commission. Our overall AOI margin was 8% in line with 2013. Normalized operating income for the year was $161 million, an improvement of 7% over last year on the same basis even with the $38 million benefit in 2013 from the gain on disposal of assets and after deducting the non-cash accounting charges in 2014 largely coming from the goodwill write off of our international concerts business, our operating income for the year was $7 million. We delivered net income on a normalized basis for the year of $22 million compared to a net loss of $27 million for last year. This normalized net income equates to a positive EPS of $0.09 for 2014. After deducting the non-cash charges, net of the non-controlling interest share, our net loss for 2014 was $91 million and EPS was a loss of $0.49. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.6 billion, down 3% over last year, driven by an 11% drop in concerts revenue with a shift in activities in the third quarter this year as Joe netted. The rest of our operating divisions delivered double-digit growth in revenue for the quarter with the increase in ticketing revenue driven by higher primary and secondary ticketing volumes globally and the increase in sponsorship and advertising revenue coming from more online advertising deals. AOI for the quarter was up to $72 million. Concerts AOI was a loss of $67 million, compared to a loss of $40 million in 2013. The fourth quarter was impacted by fewer arena shows internationally along with the timing of our global touring activity. Ticketing AOI in the fourth quarter was $94 million, up 16% from last year's $81 million with the growth in primary and secondary ticket sales in both North America and Europe. Sponsorship and advertising's AOI for the fourth quarter was $50 million, up 24% from the prior year, coming from the increased arena activity. And Artist Nation AOI was $18 million, up 49% from last year with higher management commissions. In the fourth quarter, our normalized operating loss was $41 million in line with the fourth quarter of last year and after deducting the non-cash charges, our operating loss was $187 million. Lastly, our normalized net loss for the quarter was $81 million after deducting the same non-cash charges, net of the non-controlling interest share, our net loss for the quarter was $186 million. Moving on to cash flow, for the full year free cash flow was $327 million, a 9% increase over the $300 million last year. The increase for the year was due to our higher AOI, net of the increase in distributions to non-controlling interest. Our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI was 59% in 2014, in line with our targeted AOI conversion. Free cash flow was $19 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $17 million in 2013. Cash flow from operations was $269 million 2014, as compared to $417 million last year. The decrease year-over-year is primarily due to higher artist advances made towards the end of 2014 as we bought more 2015 tours supporting our growth and global market shares. As of December 31, we had total cash of $1.4 billion, which includes $534 million in ticketing client cash. Our free cash, which excludes the event related cash for future shows was $494 million as compared to $445 million in 2013. And as I noted, our deferred revenue per concerts was $464 million at the end of the year, an increase of 7% over the $434 million last year. Total capital expenditures for 2014 were in line with our expectations at $134 million of which $60 million was spend on maintenance items. Revenue generating capital expenditures totaled $74 million with higher investments in technology and development of innovative new products, along with an increase in venue related projects as compared to last year. Our total debt was $2.1 billion as of December 31, and our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discounts and including the debt premium is 4.3%. Our debt covenant requires a maximum leverage ratio of five times and we're comfortable in compliance of below four times at December 31. We’re excited that we delivered another record year of operating results with growth in revenue AOI and free cash flow and we’re looking forward to another strong year in 2015. Thank you for joining us for the call today. We’ll now open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from David Joyce with Evercore ISI.
David Joyce: Thank you. I was wondering if you can provide more color on the Ticketmaster savings that you're running ahead of schedule would you be at a run rate perhaps by the middle of this year or is that sort of going to be dependent on the phasing of the ticket sales goes this year?
Joe Berchtold: Hey David, it’s Joe. I think at this point we’re just comfortable saying it’s going to be -- we’re going to get it out over the course of the year, not going to give you anything specific to the quarters, obviously as we get into the higher volume quarters it makes it all easier to get to that number. But we’re sticking to over the course of the year.
David Joyce: Thanks and I appreciate the help on sizing and thinking about the FX, but could you talk what the impact was on the concerts in the fourth quarter?
Joe Berchtold: Oh yeah I gave you -- what I gave you was for the full year, it was about 1% of AOI almost all of that was fourth quarter impact and given that most of our revenues was in concerts you could assume that was a large driver. But again we hedge the input versus the output, so when we commit to an artist to do a tour in Europe, pay him in U.S. dollars, we hedge at that point to dollars again the revenue we get from the European ticket sales. So we’re not just exposed again the revenue, most of it is a profit exposure if you will.
David Joyce: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong: Thanks. Two questions just first on your guidance, when you talk about how the growth is sustainable and repeatable. Is this a 60 number or 60 number can you just help us think about kind of the growth CAGRs and elaborate on the guidance? And my second question is on acquisition for festivals. Anyway to think about the synergies either top or bottom line synergies with Austin City Limits and Lollapalooza. Thanks.
Michael Rapino: Thanks Amy, on the guidance a few years ago, we had given a three-year plan and a target to get to our $600 million goal. And we're obviously in the last year of that three-year plan. We believe we’re on track to deliver our goal. Obviously there’s always inquiries about will you give further guidance beyond '16 or beyond '15, it's not something that we’re going to get in a habit of, but I wanted to kind of give you kind of an overview there that if you look at what we’ve been able to accomplish over the last three years, cumulatively regardless of exactly what year was up slightly versus the other. And you were trying to build a model '16, '17 and '18, our message there is to you getting from a $300 million-ish to $600 million was because we built a better business, we’re investing in the right levers and we’re monetizing it. And we do some tuck in acquisitions in every now and then a C3. So we can kind of repeat history going forward and we would expect to deliver if we were sitting here somewhere in the year 2019 and looking back over the last three years, our goal would be to continually deliver that kind of ongoing growth. And then on the festival question Amy, what we said is that when we buy a festival, our expectation is that it is going to be accretive to our business within the second size of our festivals after we buy -- so often when we buy a business, because the planning for the next festival are already well underway. There is a limited amount of impact which will impact it, but the limited amount again by the cycle after that we’ll have our sponsorship team our ticketing organization, our operations team totally working alongside the acquisition to make sure that we’re getting to that accretive level.
Amy Yong: Great thanks and congrats on the year.
Michael Rapino: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee.
Vasily Karasyov: Thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give us a breakdown of the adjusted operating income growth in this sponsorship and advertising segment. What percentage of that is organic meaning it grew not from its positions, but what you had prior to the year start? And how dependent are you on continued acquisitions of festivals, promoters and so on in order to see this growth rate sustained into the future?
Joe Berchtold: Our $300 million in advertising sponsorship revenue I don’t know off the top 95% of that is organic. You have -- the scale that we already have when we do a bolt-on like C3 or we -- which is not in last year's numbers anyways. But when we do a bolt-on or addition, it’s adding some incremental tickets and some incremental volumes on our quest to continually go from 5,000 shows to 22,000 shows to 30,000 shows. But our high margin advertising business has been growing at double-digits off its base organic business.
Vasily Karasyov: And do you feel like you still have headroom to go in terms of growth there on organic basis that does that we’re not monetizing it fully right now or you depend on growing attendance?
Joe Berchtold: No we think we have if you do simple math and you say how big is the size of the price various reports will tell you that there’s $18 billion, $20 billion spent corporate America on sports and music. So break that down and give you somewhere in a $1.5 billion to $2 billion spent in the music space. If you look at the size of our business and we’re generating $300 million out of the $1.5 billion we know that we don’t have to go compete against NBA or Sport. So our main line advertising just to get a bigger piece of that advertising space, but it is dedicated to music. A key function of that is we’ve been doing very well over the last many net multiple years. And just to keep adding incremental ad units so staying out with the market. So nine years ago was a sign in amphitheater and then we elevated our staff and started selling strategic deals. And then we hired a digital team and started building an ad network and then last year we started monetizing our content and this year we started mobile advertising. So we think we got a 400% plus sales team so we got a group credible diverse set of skills there. They know how to sell content and how to sell digital and how to sell strategic and local and we think our assets are still undervalued and we will continue to be able to roll that high margin business as one of the core drivers of our business in terms of no capital required just monetizing the scale.
Vasily Karasyov: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our final question from Martin Pyykkonen with Rosenblatt Securities.
Martin Pyykkonen: Yeah, thanks couple of quick things, Joe you mentioned a few things in terms of outlook for the New Year, but I was wondering if you could kind of considering you have visibility obviously in the festivals you might buy and touring that things that haven’t been announced obviously. Can you project any mix by venue Q2 and Q3 and Q3 in particular in that what extent that might vary from 2014 if at all and unless I missed it, I don’t think there was any specific comments about the EDM segment, is that something you expect to be up this year in 2015 and any way you can scope any magnitude even if it’s not on official number. Thanks.
Michael Rapino: Yeah I’ll give you kind of a general on the pipe, every year we always say that we have such scale that while I’ll be sitting here in a year from now telling you that I had 22,000, 23,000 shows, yes. We have no fear that our global staff are the best at it. We’ll continue to get our share of the market and slightly more. Last year, we had an exceptional in the U.S. only an exceptional stadium year. Had a lot of big stadium tours out last year. We don’t see that repeating this year. But we’re already seeing a much stronger arenas business this year, because the artist have decided maybe I’m not going to go in stadiums, but I’ll do longer U.S. states will come to life. I think you’ll also see some artist debate whether with the FX cost and the cost of business that they do a few more shows in America versus traveling overseas. So we would look at the pipe it will be consistent from a show count, total ticket number year-over-year we see it still being given again it was a record year this year, which would be the record year the year before. So the benchmark continually gets higher, but we think we will repeat history. We think we’ll have a strong arena market this year. We think festivals in Europe will be stronger this year than last year. And we think the EDM business, we have continually within Somiak taken a very disciplined approach to how we grow Electric Daisy to main festival in Vegas. We launched one last year in Mexico. We launched one in London. We’ll continue to launch a few more of those on a global basis this year. And we continue to think EDM is a great channel and to be in the portfolio and it’s providing some great advertising sponsorship opportunities as well as in 2015 the first year we’ll officially move in Somiak all over to the Ticketmaster platform. So we start to get the double benefit of feeding the ticketing and advertising pipe.
Martin Pyykkonen: So you characterized EDM just out of the words of your mouth, but the demand is still vibrant as far as the end market, I mean there’s no concern from you sampling on that part and sounds like?
Michael Rapino: No I would characterize it as I think it’s a strong, stable, global business, but the reality of EDM is when you’re not hitting mainline arena stadiums and festivals like country, rock and roll, pop and urban it's always going to be a small percent of our total business, because it’s more about 10 great festivals of summer that matter versus 4,000 shows that happen across America that matter. So great small niche business, but given it operate kind of outside of the traditional venue platform, it allows to be more eventism and smaller to the total business.
Martin Pyykkonen: I just had one quick question on ticketing, not so much again in number. But as you look at secondary ticketing revenue mix, I’m assuming in your plans you would have that increasing as a percentage of mix over time. Should we be thinking of that as margin neutral or margin accretive or margin negative in terms of mix or secondary ticketing revenue relative to primary ticketing revenue over a multiple quarter few year time period?
Michael Rapino: I would think of it as fairly margin neutral it’s the same overall business concept is primary, which is we got some cost of acquiring rights that selling ticket season have service fees around the same 20%ish and you got operating cost against that to put you in low 20s kind of AOI rate. So there’s nothing structurally different between primary in terms of the pipes of margin you should see.
Martin Pyykkonen: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

The release, reconciliations and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Investor Relations tab on investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. I'm joined today by Joe Berchtold, our COO; and Kathy Willard, our CFO. We had a great third quarter, and 2014 is on track to be another record year, delivering revenue, AOI and free cash flow growth. For the first 9 months of the year, revenue was up 9% and AOI is up 11%, with all divisions growing both top line [ph] and AOI. Our business model of building the leading concerts platform as a flywheel, driving our other high-margin businesses is working. We are continuing to build share in Concerts and Artist Management and driving growth in Sponsorship and Ticketing. The Live business continues to have a robust outlook as artists are now fully reliant on touring as their main earnings driver, and the best means to engage and connect with their fan base. The ongoing flow of new artists continues to reemphasize the business as fans, more than ever, find the Live experience from club shows to stadiums to festivals a top entertainment choice and the best means to celebrate their favorite artist and share the experience with friends, both on-site and online. The connected world and mobile access allows fans to become the greatest marketing boom for artists and concerts. Our research shows 64% of concertgoers engage in online activities at the show, and 76% of concert attendees in the U.S. who took photos or videos at the concert post them online. All of this is generating billions of earned media impressions on social media for our shows. At Live Nation, we see great continued runway ahead given the fragmented global landscape in concerts management and ticketing. And as our scale grows, we continue to drive increasing economics in our business model with higher profits per show, more advertising and improved ticket conversion. I'll now provide you an update on our core strategies. First, we continue to grow our global concerts market share. Fan demand remains strong globally, and we are continuing to grow by taking share, building 22 of the top 25 global tours this year, including Jay-Z, Beyoncé, One Direction and Luke Bryan. We also further growing our festivals portfolio, and we are expecting nearly 5 million fans across 65 global festivals with 8% growth from 2013, and we continue to add more markets to our global footprint by promoting concerts now in 40 countries, adding an office in the Philippines this quarter, and we increased our attendance per show. Artist Management is now operating in full gear as we have attracted a number of new managers to this group, repping acts including Madonna, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, Nicki Minaj and Lil' Wayne. The Sponsorship & Advertising business continues to deliver strong margins and growth to drive our overall AOI. At this point, we have sold over 90% of our planned sponsorships and advertising for the year, and contracted revenue is up 10% from this point last year. The success of our Live Nation channel at Yahoo! demonstrated the potential we have in further monetizing our concerts platform, creating compelling content that we can widely distribute and drive advertising revenue. We have now delivered over 100 continuous days of a live show a night with millions of viewers tuning in to watch. With this proof of concept successful, we look to expand and grow our live streaming and content products to further provide advertisers with a focused suite of products from Live Nation. We believe we have great growth opportunities as we improve the advertising experience for brands that want to reach that highly desirable music fan, on-site and on all screens, in a highly targeted fashion. Our combination of on-site access, engaging content and data provides a unique and compelling network for advertisers. And finally, Ticketmaster, finally continues to deliver on its 3 priorities: First, our TicketMaster+ product is working even better than our expectation of a year ago. It has been activated from over 13,000 events since it's launched last September and year-on-year, global secondary GTV is up 44% year-to-date. The broad adoption of the platform by fans and teens gives us confidence that we'll capture over 1 billion in new sale GTV since our launch last September through the end of 2014 with continued growth momentum into '15. Second, our mobile platform continues to grow rapidly as we make ongoing improvements to the mobile experience for fans to buy, transfer, sell and scan their tickets. The number of tickets sold on mobile platform is up 33% for the first 3 quarters, accounting for 18% of total ticket sales. And at the same time, we remain committed to delivering the best fan experience on every platform and lowering our cost structure as we do so. We continue to deploy new products this year, but we will continue to reduce our costs by up to $0.15 for tickets this year, ahead of schedule and over -- and halfway to our achieved goal of $0.35 per ticket. As we near the end of 2014, Live Nation has never been in a stronger position. We have built the best live platform in the world and we are successfully leveraging our platform to build adjacent high-margin businesses. We are on track to deliver our 3-year strategic plan for 2015, and have great confidence in our longer-term growth opportunities in our core lanes of Concerts, Advertising and Ticketing. I'll now turn the call over to Joe who will take you through an update on these divisions.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. First, with Concerts. In the third quarter, Concert revenue increased 11%, and AOI was up 17% compared to 2013. We had record fan attendance for the quarter as expected, with 22 million people attending our shows. The growth this quarter was driven by North America and, notably, a tripling of our stadium business. Looking more broadly at our full year-to-date, which does a better job of smoothing out timing. We've had a record 46 million fans attend our shows, delivering commensurate record profitability. We've seen that having a broad portfolio of markets and venue types continues to pay off for us as this year, we had a high volume of stadium shows and strong performance in amps and across festivals to grow the overall business. We're also continuing to increase our profitability for fans with pricing per ticket up 6% on a global basis and per-fan spending in our amphitheaters and festivals up 6% as well. Looking at the fourth quarter and full year, we continue to expect to deliver double-digit AOI growth in the concert business. The fourth quarter looks to continue our trend of a bit lower arena activity, but we still expect to end the year with record attendance as we continue to build our global market share. On Artist Nation. Our Artist Management business had another great quarter as well, with revenue up 18% and AOI up 73%. Again, here, we expect to see a bit lower activity from timing in the fourth quarter, but overall, for the year, project revenue and AOI growth along with a strong lineup set for 2015. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. For the third quarter, Sponsorship & Advertising revenue was up 4%, and AOI up 6%, consistent with our year-to-date performance. Our top focus for the year has been on taking our advertising business to the next level, leveraging our content platform to create products we can monetize through third-party platforms. Our live streaming show is the first example of this success with more to come soon. Now the second focus has been continuing to build the breadth and depth of our strategic sponsorship relationships, and we now have over 50 sponsors spending over $1 million each a year with Live Nation. As we look to 2014 in total for Sponsorship & Advertising, given where we are with contracted revenue, we continue to expect AOI growth consistent with the past few years with a strong fourth quarter and more back-end activity this year. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketing revenue was up 8%, while AOI was up 7%. And year-to-date revenue was up 9% and AOI is up 7%, as we have processed over 300 million primary tickets totaling over $15 billion in gross transaction value, up 5% year-on-year. And as Michael said, our secondary ticketing gross transaction value is up 44% year-to-date. These growth rates, along with our expectation of, again, delivering a net renewal rate of over 100% for the year, indicates that Ticketmaster's platform is continuing to deliver a great value proposition to both fans and venues. For fans, our integrated primary and secondary is not only driving growth in our secondary business, but increasing overall conversion. In general, we have seen that fans are 30% more likely to buy a ticket when they see both primary and secondary tickets together, versus just what's left of their primary options. And at the same time, our mobile offerings are making it easier for fans to buy and manage their tickets and our continued rapid transition is further reinforcing Ticketmaster's multi-platform leadership. Our venue clients also continue to see the benefits of our ongoing technology investments as we have had a big push into mobile products for them as well this year, growing our mobile box office and mobile reporting products. Looking at Ticketing for the fourth quarter and full year, we expect to maintain our momentum of continued secondary growth, capture improvements in our cost structure and have another strong fourth quarter of on sales for 2015. Collectively, we expect this to deliver mid-single-digit AOI growth for the business for the full year. Overall, we had a great third quarter and expect to deliver our fourth consecutive year of revenue AOI and free cash flow growth and grow the profitability at each of our businesses. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to take you through more details on our financials.
Elizabeth K. Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with our results for the third quarter. Revenue was $2.5 billion, up 11% from last year. Concerts revenue was also up 11%, primarily due to more shows and higher attendance in North America from several successful stadium tours, along with increased sales in amphitheaters. Ticketing revenue was up 8% driven by higher domestic resale fees as a result of the continuing success of our TM+ product, along with increases in primary ticket revenue. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $258 million, up 17% from last year's $221 million. Concerts AOI was $83 million, up 17% from the strong stadium activity in North America. Ticketing AOI was $86 million, up 7% from the growth in domestic primary and Resale revenue. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI was $88 million, up 6%, driven by growth in international venue and festival sponsorship and domestic online advertising. And Artist Nation AOI was $22 million, a $9 million increase over last year from higher management commissions from existing managers and the additional several new managers. Operating income was $151 million this quarter, 19% higher than the $126 million reported last year, driven by the growth in AOI. And net income in the third quarter was $105 million versus $44 million in 2013. The improvement in net income was driven by our higher operating income, lower income tax expense this quarter associated with deferred tax benefits from acquisitions and the loss on debt refinancing we had last year. Now for the 9-month results. Revenue was $5.3 billion, up 9% over last year. The increase was driven by a 10% growth in Concerts revenue due to more shows and higher attendance in our North American amphitheaters and strong stadium tours along with increased global touring activity. Ticketing revenue was up 9%, driven by higher domestic primary ticket volume and fees, along with higher Resale tickets fees. AOI for the 9 months is $483 million, 11% higher than last year, as we grew profitability in all of our business segments. Concerts AOI increased by 17% to $117 million from increased amphitheater and stadium activity in North America. Ticketing AOI was $232 million, a 7% increase from the growth domestically in primary and Resale ticket sales. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI grew 6% year-over-year to $163 million due to the growth in North America sponsorships in online advertising, along with increased venue sponsorships internationally. And Artist Nation AOI grew from $20 million for the first 9 months of 2013 to $30 million in 2014 from higher management commissions. Operating income was $194 million for the 9 months, 27% ahead of the $153 million we would have reported last year without the $38 million higher gain on disposal of assets, an increase consistent with our AOI growth. On a reported basis, our operating income was up $3 million from $191 million in 2013. For the 9 months, net income was $96 million, up from $39 million reported last year, with the growth coming from operating income along with a $27 million decrease in our income tax expense driven by a reduction in taxable foreign earnings and deferred tax benefits associated with acquisitions. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $198 million, 19% higher than last year, driven by our higher AOI. Free cash flow for the 9 months was $308 million versus $283 million last year, with the growth primarily due to the increase in AOI less higher CapEx and noncontrolling interest distributions. As we noted in our last quarterly call, we still expect that free cash flow for the year as a percentage of AOI will be roughly in line with our 2013 results. Cash flow from operations was a negative $14 million for the 9 months compared to $265 million last year. This swing came from 3 of our working capital lines, all reflecting short-term timing impacts. Accounts receivable were up about $90 million, following the very high volume of stadium shows in this quarter with several in the latter part of the quarter not yet settled at the end of September. Prepaid expenses and other assets were also up about $90 million, driven primarily by artist advances for tours in 2015. In general, we are more than willing to extend advances to more tours as we continue building our global Concerts business. And accrued liabilities and AP were down about $130 million, largely from the timing of ticketing client on sales versus last year. All 3 of these factors are merely short-term timing and, in general, Concerts remain an attractive working capital business. We expect much of this timing anomaly to work its way through the system by yearend with more comparable levels of receivables and payables at that point. As of September 30, after redeeming the $220 million of our original convertible debt and completing our largest quarter of the year in terms of show activity, we reported total cash of $1.4 billion. This includes $532 million of Ticketing client cash and $186 million of net future concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $640 million, up approximately $100 million from this time last year. Total event-related deferred revenue as of September 30 was $319 million, slightly higher than the $313 million we reported in September last year. Our total capital expenditures through September were $89 million, with $47 million spent for maintenance CapEx projects and the remaining amount spent on revenue-generating projects. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect that total capital expenditures will be approximately $135 million, around 2% of revenue. After redeeming the full $220 million of our original convertible debt this quarter, our total debt was $2.1 billion as of September 30. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding the debt discounts and including the debt premium on our term loans and notes, was 4.3%. Our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of 5.25x, and we are comfortably in compliance of below 4x as of September 30. In the third quarter, we delivered the strong results we expected and we are excited about the growth we delivered across all the business segments. Looking forward to the end of the year, we continue to expect to deliver growth in revenue, AOI and free cash flow and to grow the overall profitability of each of our segments while continuing to invest in and to build our businesses to set them up for continued growth in the future. Thank you for joining us today for an overview of our record third quarter results. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee.
Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I had a question on the secondary tickets market. Can you please quantify what percentage of the -- or what portion of the revenue growth came from secondary? I think in the 10-Q, you said that the majority of your growth came from there. And if you could give us an idea about the margin profile of that revenue, how different it is from the primary.
Michael Rapino: If I'm not -- so we said the secondary growth was up 44% year-to-date. I'm not sure I fully understood the question. But the margin profile, as we've said, is very consistent with our primary tickets. We have margins that we expected, over time, as that business scales, to be consistent with kind of that rather mid-20s range.
Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: My question was if you look at the revenue growth year-on-year, what percentage of that revenue increase came from secondary?
Michael Rapino: Yes, we haven't -- we are not breaking that out.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Research: One question and then one follow-up, if I could. First, I was wondering if you could actually comment on some of the acquisitions that have been talked about in the Industry Rag [ph], including C3 and also Greek Theatre [ph]. And I guess, now that you're wrapping up your CapEx spend, what are your priorities for free cash flow? And then just one really quick housekeeping question. Can you just give us, Kathy, what the right share count is given all the different convertible activity that's been going on and what the right number we should be using going forward?
Michael Rapino: Amy, it's Michael. I didn't -- we don't -- we've historically just not commented on our acquisitions until we close them. I think it would be fair to say, we've been very vocal on our priorities over the last couple of years, that we are continuing to grow our global Concerts business, whether that means the festival channels, like we did with EDM. We've been very clear that we've been underserviced in our festival business in the U.S. There's a big hole for our business, which really drives our Ticketing and then Sponsorship, and we're going to continue to grow internationally. So I can't comment on the rumors, but it would make sense that we would be looking to acquire a strong festival company in the U.S. that we've outlined already as a priority for us for cash flow, and we're going to continue to rally it. There is a lot of great global opportunities and sizable ones in the Ticketing and Concerts space that would continue to supercharge our growth if the price and the return was at the right level.
Elizabeth K. Willard: And Amy, on the share count, on basic level, I'd used the number on front of the Q, which is the 200.7 million. On a diluted basis, you're right. It's because of the timing of when we bought in that convert. The diluted is a little bit high, and if you want use the diluted we use, I'd take out about 8 million shares, which would take you down to more like 213 million on a diluted basis, on a comparable basis.
Operator: All right, and we'll take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies LLC.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the Sponsorship segment? Growth seems a little below trend year-to-date and I'm wondering if there's anything timing for us to think about or maybe any change in renewal rates.
Michael Rapino: Yes. That's why we tried to give you some very specific numbers in terms of being up 10% on a contracted revenue basis relative to last year, to give you some comfort but even though what we have recognized thus far year-to-date is at a lower trend, we gave you that, we're over 90% sold and we're up 10% year-on-year. So we think that should give some comfort that we will continue to grow at that historical rate that we've done in the past few years. So it will be more fourth quarter backloaded this year.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Joe, on that 10%, for example, is the average length the same? Or is that a bit extended?
Joe Berchtold: There's no material change in the duration of our average sponsorship deal.
John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. One related question -- or unrelated question I should say. I know it's early, but is there any evidence that your channel in Yahoo! is driving growth or efficiencies across other parts of the Live Nation platform?
Michael Rapino: Well, in the ecosystem, we're -- we know that any way we can continue to add ad units to our advertising businesses, how we very clearly outlined how we continue to grow. So one of the holes in our portfolio to date has been that video. So Yahoo! was able to provide us enough eyeballs with our content. So my advertising team now, when they're walking in to deliver against those RFPs, has an ad unit on video. So our Sponsorship business was sole benefit of that strategy. And then on a secondary point, we don't have any evidence yet that, that scale that would've mattered. But we do know from our research that the average fan, when he's debating about going to a concert, the casual fan, he spends a couple of weeks shopping. And we know that the #1 way that you can get a casual fan to press the buy button is by a live video of that artist, is a very stimulating conversion tool. So we do know is the more we scale and bring a high-quality live experience to the fan and add a buy button, we know it's also a great conversion mechanism for our core business. So it will be core benefit. It's a sponsorship ad unit, and a longer-term benefit is conversion around the ticket.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Tinker with Maxim.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: 8% festival attendance growth, how much of that was organic?
Michael Rapino: That will be all basically organic because we had the full year in. So we started -- we launched -- as we do every year, we organically launch across the globe from our various 30, 40 markets, we launch 8 to 10 festivals a year and organically see which one of those ones are able to sustain M.I.A. in Los Angeles. We launched the country one in Detroit and we launched a few across the U.K. and Europe. So mostly organic and continuing -- we'll continue to do both organic and bolt-ons to remain as the leader in the Festivals segment.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: And as a follow-up, as the festival business tends to have a -- can have a margin of 25% as opposed to the promotion business, which can be sort of 2% to 4%, at some point, would you see your margin in the Concerts division starting to tick up as festivals become a bigger percentage?
Michael Rapino: Well, first of all, our revenue is so big on our main line business that affecting the bottom line margin on our business, even with 65 festivals or 100 festivals, is always just a hard math game because of our massive growth across our 25,000-plus main line shows. But your core -- the core to the question is why we're in Sponsorship and Festivals. Remember, a concert may have a 4% margin business at the door, but the -- an amphitheater concert may be 4% on the door, but still it's a 20%, 30%, 40% margin business when you add sponsorship to it. So we know that when you have any type of concert where you control the environment, your sponsorship is going to be highly accretive to that proposition. So festivals in Europe are driven by sponsorship, and so our U.S. ones and they are a key product, if you want to call, to grow your core Sponsorship business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from David Joyce with International Strategy & Investment Group.
David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could provide some more color as to your recent acquisitions in Belgium. Does that provide you now the full complement of assets and activities there? If you could talk about what else you've got in that country. And then secondly, how does Eventjoy fit into your Ticketing product set?
Michael Rapino: Yes. Belgium is a perfect example of why our model and our scale works. We have a very large Festivals and Concerts business in Belgium. We have not had a concert -- hadn't had any Ticketing business in Belgium so we are always weighing the options of buying the large one, starting our own or finding a smaller acquisition that provides us a faster ramp-up, and Belgium was the perfect example where we were able to find a relatively inexpensive backroom. And overnight, we have our content now with our Ticketmaster support from U.K. to be now a legitimate ticketing and concert business in Belgium. So we're always looking where we have content. In those 40 markets around the world, we would have an ongoing business development assessment on launch it or buy it and what's the best return, and Belgium is an example where that came to life and you'll continue to see that model and those -- of those 2 extremes come together. Eventjoy is similar to what we originally did with TicketWeb. We believe that Ticketmaster+ is a -- obviously, a fabulous mainstream brand that's going to continue to do and service its mainstream clients. We have a great company in TicketWeb that's out there every day fighting other competitors on the GA [ph] club business. And we knew that we need a do-it-yourself product to be able to enter that subspace. We wanted again to enter at a fairly low risk to understand the category. And then the magic with our scale is we like to go in low cost, learn and then provide the scale of Ticketmaster to excel the growth. So Eventjoy, a really strong product team. We like the individuals. We like the product. We're going to learn a lot about that space this year, and we're already looking at ways that we can help attach the fire hose to propel that business in that space.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Ben Mogil with Stifel Financial.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Michael, so on the cost savings, which, I think, you sort of moved from $0.10 to $0.15 on the North American Ticketing side, can you talk about what sort of drove the push forward, if you will, about it? And then on the $0.35 target, do you see more upside from there? And then sort of as a follow-on, what about the international front? Can you give us the time line there around the ticket savings?
Michael Rapino: I'm going to let Joe take that one.
Joe Berchtold: Sure, yes. So Ben, as you've indicated, we previously guided to $0.10, and just our overall technology investments that we're making are letting us move a little faster than we had thought, 3, 6 months ago, and we're taking now more costs aggressively as we can to capture that for everybody. So combined with what we had already captured before this year, this is why we said we're more than halfway through the $0.35 target. And we think that overall, we are on target or on track with next year's getting to a run rate of $0.35. I don't think we're ready to declare that as something that will exceed at this point, but we certainly understand that, over time, one of the keys to Ticketmaster's success is we are truly omnipresent in all the channels of online, mobile and so on as having a very efficient cost structure-wide platform. And then our plan is, yes, that as we get that technology fully deployed in the U.S., we then take that to our markets internationally. Again, I don't think we're ready for the public declaration on the timing of that, but that is absolutely the plan.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And so maybe on -- and just the U.S. because, obviously, you're further ahead there. When do you think, and you don't have to give me like an actual date, but approximately, when are you thinking you can kind of take the training wheels off the new system and kind of close down the legacy systems?
Michael Rapino: Yes. So I think as we've talked, this is redoing it as we go, modules being replaced like by new modules. So there are no training wheels in the approach that we've taken. We are redoing the pieces as we go. I think we'll have complete products in our Concerts segment before long that won't have any of remnant core components of inventory management or e-commerce to them, and then we'll roll it out, aligned with the timing of the sports leagues to those teams over the next couple of years.

The release, reconciliations and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Investor Relations tab on investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon. Welcome to our second quarter 2014 conference call. As we are now well into the third quarter, I'm confident we will have another record year in 2014 and deliver our planned revenue, AOI and free cash flow growth for the year and into 2015. All of our businesses continue to grow as we see strong global demand with all positive indicators on consumer spending for a lot of events. Against this backdrop, we are building global market share in Concerts and Ticketing, attracting new brands to our Sponsorship & Advertising platform, and have now fully aligned Artist Management with the rest of the company. As a result, our revenues are up 7% for the half and AOI, up 6% with all 4 divisions growing both top line and AOI through the first 2 quarters. To provide you an update on our core growth strategies, first, growing our global concerts market share, we have sold over 42 million tickets for shows this year, up 3% from this point last year. On the touring side, we're promoting 21 of the top 25 global tours this year, continuing to differentiate Live Nation as the partner of choice for touring artists. In festivals, we are continuing our strength in Europe and now building a much stronger portfolio in North America, where we now have 7 festivals that can attract over 100,000 people, up from just one such festival 2 years ago. This includes the Electric Daisy Carnival in Vegas with nearly 400,000 fans last month, making it the largest single weekend festival in the country. And globally, we will promote shows in 40 countries this year. We expect to have our strategy for Central and South America in place by the end of the year, establishing our next growth platform. Increasingly feeding the concert pipeline is our artist management position, and we expect over 40% growth in major artist shows promoted by Live Nation this year. With our repositioning of this business now complete, we have been in growth mode this year, adding such artists as U2, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears, and are now managing over 250 artists. The Sponsorship & Advertising business continues to grow. We look forward about 80% of our plans, Sponsorship & Advertising for the year. Contracted sponsorships revenue is up 11% from this point last year, and we're now driving online advertising growth needed to deliver on our full year growth expectations. Sponsorships growth is coming from continued success for both festival platform and the additional and expansion of strategic relationships with major brands, including Budweiser, SAP, Kellogg's, Hertz and Citi. On the advertising side, we have a two-part strategy. First, we are growing advertising from the traffic coming to our site, up 23% in the past quarter as we added more content in Live Nation.com and relaunched our EDM content and insomniac.com. And second with Yahoo!, we now have launched our Live Nation channel, streaming a concert a today. Going forward, we see great opportunities for additional programming with Yahoo! and other distribution partners, which we believe will drive continued advertising growth. And finally, Ticketmaster is now delivering on its potential. With our technology investments powering new fan products and setting the foundation for continued growth. Our top product focus for the past year has been TicketMaster-Plus. And in July, we expect a 90% year-on-year increase in global secondary GTV, driven by a 600% increase in secondary concerts activity. This product has now been widely accepted by fans, teams and artists alike, and as a benefit to them, selling more tickets and keeping the secondary value within the content ecosystem. And as a result, we expect to capture over $1 billion in resale GTV since our launch last September through the end of this year. In primary tickets, we have sold $10 billion worth of tickets in the first half, and we continue to see a rapid shift to mobile ticketing, with nearly 40% growth in mobile ticket sales this year and 17% of tickets now purchased on our mobile platforms. As we have improved the ease by which the fans can buy, transfer and sell their tickets, and with 60% of tickets in North America now able to enter a show with a mobile bar code, we expect this to continue driving mobile growth and further Ticketmaster's distinctive proposition both fans and venues. As a result, we expect to deliver a net renewal rate of over 100% at Ticketmaster for the fifth straight year since the merger, clearly demonstrating that our investment at Ticketmaster are paying off and the confidence our partners have in the future of Ticketmaster. 2014 continues to be on track and I expect the company will deliver our fourth consecutive year of revenue, AOI and free cash flow growth and grow the profitability of each business. Longer term, I continue to see great ongoing growth opportunities for the company. The underlying demand for Live continue to be strong globally, and as one of the few truly borderless businesses we have numerous opportunities to increase our market share, and we have now shown that we can effectively drive scale in concerts and from that build our Sponsorship and Ticketing businesses, therefore, growing revenue, AOI and free cash flow. I will now turn it over to Joe to take you through the update of the divisions.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. First, concerts. As I indicated on our last earnings call, with the timing of shows this year, our Q2 had lower show count than Q2 2013. As a result, revenue declined 2% and AOI is down 13%. Specifically, as I previously indicated, we had a substantial shift of arena activity from Q2 into Q1, so arena attendance for the quarter is down 14% though up 6% in total for the first half. Similarly, we're expecting our festival activity to weigh more heavily to Q3 this year and give us mid-single digit festival attendance growth for the year, despite Q2 festival attendance being down for the second quarter this year. Looking more broadly at other indicators, we're confident we will increase our market share and fan base this year. First, as Michael said, all of our tickets sold for the shows this year is over 42 million as of July 21, up 3% from this point last year. Our attendance per show was up 4% in the first half, led by arenas and stadiums. Also, as of the end of the first half, for the first time in the company's history, we sold over 2 million tickets per a single act, One Direction, which is in the midst of a highly successful global stadium tour. And this is indicative of the broad demand for concerts across all genres, venue types and markets. With our list of top-selling artists continuing to be diverse with such artists as Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, Luke Bryan and Lady Gaga. As a result, we're also seeing tremendous growth in our stadium business, which we expect to be up over 50% for the third quarter. And with this demand in the third quarter, we expect to achieve record attendance at our shows of 23 million fans in the 3-month period alone, which will put us up 4% through the first 3 quarters relative to 2013. And as a result, we believe any short-term timing on shows will be more than caught up over the next 2 months. And for the full year, we expect to build our market share, grow attendance and deliver double-digit AOI growth in concerts. On Artist Nation. For the quarter, both revenue and AOI are down on the division, driven by a combination of timing with our managers and their acts and are discontinuing some services in the division compared to last year. Despite this, revenue is up slightly for the first half and AOI remains up double digits year-to-date. And looking forward to the full year, on the strength of these new managers and artists that Michael discussed, we expect AOI to grow double digits for the business. Turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. For the second quarter, revenue was flat and AOI up 4%, while for the first half, revenue is up 4% and AOI up 6%. The first half strength was driven by our sponsorships business in particular, as we had strong increases in our electronic festival and strategic sponsorship basis. The online part of the business is more heavily weighted in the second half this year with programs like Yahoo! as we discussed on our last earnings call. And we have been investing to get our full sales infrastructure in place in advance of this growth. At this point, with about 80% of our expected Sponsorship & Advertising sold for the year, we expect to deliver AOI growth for the year -- full year consistent with the past couple of years. Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketing revenue was up 10%, while AOI was down 1%. And for the half, revenue was up 9% and AOI is up 7%. Our primary ticket sales were up 2% for the quarter and up 1% for the year through July 21. Secondary ticket activity has been particularly strong, as Michael noted, and is up over 30% through the first half with similar growth expected through the rest of the year. There was a slight margin impact for the quarter and half driven by our increased spend on consumer facing web and mobile products for both primary and secondary ticketing. We expect this to come back in the second half as we continue to scale the businesses and deliver margins in ticketing for the full year consistent with last year. Looking then in totality of ticketing for the full year, we continue to expect low single-digit growth in primary ticketing volume, strong growth in secondary GTV and low mid-single digit growth in ticketing AOI. Overall, 2014 is shaping up well as we expected. Beyond sales and concerts and ticketing sales trends overall give us visibility into the back half of the year, and we're confident that we will again grow our businesses in 2014 and continue on track to deliver our 3-year plan in 2015. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to take you through more details on our financials.
Elizabeth K. Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with our results for the first half of 2014. Revenue for the 6 months was $2.8 billion, up 7% compared to last year, driven by concerts revenue increasing by 8% from higher arena, amphitheater and global touring activity. Ticketings revenue grew 9% in the first half due to higher primary and resell ticket volume, along with higher average ticket prices. AOI for the first half of the year was $225 million, up 6% over last year with improved performance across all of our segments. Concerts AOI increased 17% to $35 million from higher amphitheater, global touring and EDM results. Ticketing AOI was $147 million, up 7%, driven by higher global primary volume and average ticket prices due to mix of ticket types and improved secondary ticket sales. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI was up 6% to $75 million, driven by growth in strategic sponsorship programs and increased sales for EDM festivals. And Artist Nation AOI was up 12% to $8 million, driven by higher Artist Management activity. Corporate costs were up $3 million for the first 6 months, but we expect that these costs for the second half of this year will be more in line with the costs in the second half last year. Operating income was $43 million for the first 6 months versus what would have been $34 million in operating income last year without the $31 million higher gain on disposal of assets due to the sale of our New York theater and insurance recovery from hurricane damage that we received in 2013. Our 2013 reported operating income was $65 million. Net loss for the first half was a loss of $10 million, compared to what would have been a loss of $36 million in 2013 without the higher gains on disposal. Net loss on a reported basis for last year was $5 million. Turning to the details for the second quarter. Revenue was $1.7 billion this quarter, down 1% from last year, driven by concerts revenue decline of 2% from the shift of arena shows into the first quarter this year. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $142 million, down 11% year-over-year. Concerts AOI was down 13% to $37 million, impacted by the shift in arena activity the first quarter. Ticketing AOI was down 1% to $77 million. We saw growth from higher volumes across primary and resell, along with higher average ticket prices in primary, but the AOI was impacted by the investments in our technology products, along with not having the legal settlements we received last year. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI was up 4% to $49 million, driven by new and expanded strategic sponsorship programs and increased sales for EDM festival. And Artist Nation AOI was $3 million, down $5 million from last year due to the timing of artists tours and the discontinuation of certain services in this segment. Operating income was $56 million this quarter versus what would have been $71 million last year without the $26 million higher gain on disposal in the quarter. On a reported basis, our operating income was $98 million last year. The decline in operating income after the effect of the higher gains was primarily driven by the lower AOI in the quarter. Net income was $23 million this quarter versus what would have been net income of $32 million in 2013, again, without the higher gains on disposal. Net income on a reported basis for last year was $58 million. For the first half of the year, free cash flow was $110 million as compared to $117 million last year, impacted by the timing of payments and noncontrolling interest holders, which were $16 million higher in the quarter -- I'm sorry, in the 6 months. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $76 million versus $103 million last year with the decline coming from lower AOI and the timing of distributions to partners. Given our expected growth in AOI for the full year, we expect that free cash flow for the year as a percentage of our AOI will be roughly in line with 2013, up from the levels we have seen in 2011 and 2012. Cash flow from operations was $338 million for the first 6 months, down $42 million the last year due to higher payments for event-related expenses for concerts in the second half of the year, without the benefit of the cash related to the ticket sales of third-party buildings, since we don't receive those moneys until the show happens. As of June 30, we reported total cash of $2 billion, which includes net proceeds of $515 million from the May 2014 issuance of new senior notes and new convertible senior notes, and before the repayment of the $220 million of original convertible debt. Additionally, total cash includes $577 million in ticketing client cash, and $555 million in net feature concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $910 million. Total event related deferred revenue as of June 30 was flat to last year at $858 million. As we have noted, we expect increased stadium activity in the third quarter, and as of June, our total ticket sales for stadium events in the second half of 2014 are up more than 50% over last year. Since we do not receive these events ticket sales at venues in which we don't own or operate, these stadium ticket sales are not included in our June balances for deferred revenue, cash or in cash flow from operations. Our total capital expenditures year-to-date were $61 million with $32 million set for maintenance CapEx and $29 million on revenue-generating additions. For the full year, CapEx is expected to be approximately $135 million, which is consistent with our expected rate of about 2% of revenue, and around half of this will be spent on revenue-generating projects, including Ticketmaster technology products. In July, holders of $29 million of our 2.875% convertible senior notes put their notes back to the company for repayment. We are now in the process of redeeming the remaining $191 million of these notes and expect to complete the process by late September. As of June 30, our total debt was $2.3 billion, which includes the $220 million of convertible senior notes. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discounts and including the debt premium is 4.2%, and without the addition of convertible debt, this weighted average cost of debt would have been 4.3%. Our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of 5.25x, and we are comfortable in compliance with this as of June 30. After adjusting for the expected repayment of the $220 million of convertible debt, our debt leverage ratio is comfortably less than 4x for the period. Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver growth in revenue, AOI and free cash flow in 2014, and to grow the overall profitability of each of our segments, while continuing to invest in and to build our businesses to set them up for continued growth. Thank you for joining us today. And we will now open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne.
Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just to clarify that did I understand correctly that you say that some of the year-over-year declines in the quarter for some segments, that's expected and nothing changes with the full-year guidance and your 3-year guidance? And then I would like some commentary please on where potentially could you go for acquisitions, now that you have so much cash on the balance sheet. And should we expect the order of magnitude of potential deals to be outside of historical range than where it was in the past 3 years?
Michael Rapino: Thank you. Yes, to the first question, yes. As most of you know, we had a record year last year in attendance and concerts. We had a high bar, and we expected this year to beat last year from overall revenue, and then ultimately AOI and free cash flow. When you're looking at the year versus last year, we had an exceptionally strong Q1 this year. We knew last year was a strong Q2. Have lots of certain tours on the road at that time, and we knew that we're going to have a very strong Q3 this year. So we knew in totality we look at the year in total, whether Jay-Z and Beyoncé tour in June or July, we're not sure at the beginning of the year, but we knew our Q3 was going to be very strong. We weren't obsessed with leading our Q2 last year, we didn't do the activity there, but we know on a year-on basis we're going to end up exactly as we planned, growth AOI, revenue, free cash flow and finish off another record year. As far as...
Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Acquisition?
Michael Rapino: Yes, as far as acquisitions, you're going to continue see us look on a global basis. I referenced that this is a unique industry, it's borderless unlike most media entertainment with many regulations that they have around the world and what markets they can own what they can't. This is a borderless business. And that's why we're in 40 countries and counting. Our products called the tour, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, our global brands and becoming more and more global daily, thanks to the world wide web and connected world. So we're going to continually build out our platform in markets, and you're going to see us make sure that we protect our portfolio of festivals and grow those, and continue to look at any acquisitions that will further our ticketing portfolio. So open and always looking for the accretive deal that can help grow our business long-term.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Tinker with Maxim.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Could you just talk a little bit about that ticketing margins in the quarter? And given that StubHub now appears to be stumbling a little bit from layoff. What is the kind of margin we should be expecting or should think about from a secondary ticket sales, which obviously, I think you highlighted were up 30% the first half of the year?
Joe Berchtold: John, this is Joe. So on the margins for the second quarter, as I said on the call, it's simply a matter of a little bit of lumpiness in terms of some costs that we have with product development focus for both the primary and secondary products. And in totality, you should see margins for ticketing consistent with last year's margins. Secondary, at the end, obviously, builds our volume, builds our scale, which is great. It's not structurally different from primary, and it's overall economic so it becomes the same ballpark of contribution margin and AOI. But obviously, as we continue the strong growth in that business, it continues to give us more scale at Ticketmaster, which then, over time, will drive both the AOI and the cash. So we're very happy with how it's done. Michael gave the numbers on a [indiscernible] blockbuster July that we have, which is really a concert-driven month if you look at the seasonality of the sports weeks. And overall with 30% growth through the first half and that kind of in totality expected for the full year, it's clearly very, very strong growth.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Just a quick follow-up. The Concert business with Yahoo! which I think is most innovative. Which line are you reporting that revenue in? And secondly, what -- how material is this in terms of absolute dollars? How many listeners might you get?
Joe Berchtold: So the streaming of the concerts feel that the advertising against those shows is part of the Sponsorship & Advertising segment. Obviously, the concerts themselves, because those are -- all our concerts is in the Concerts segment. And given the timing of the rollout of the shows, it started in July. So it obviously is going to be a second half set of economics. We obviously expect and Yahoo! expects to have attractive Sponsorship & Advertising against the shows well in excess of the cost of the shows. We haven't broken out specific viewership at this point. We may later on, but we haven't done that yet. More broadly, we look at this as this is the launch of our first show. And we're shipping out to where we're not just monetizing the $30 million odd unique to comes to our Live Nation and Ticketmaster platforms every year. But we're truly monetizing the 23,000 shows and 60 million fans we have, working with other partners that have tremendous distribution reach and taking that monetization to another level. And we expect this we deploy more programs that just collectively builds up to be a significant scale and is one of the key drivers of our ongoing strong growth in the Sponsorship & Advertising business.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Research: Two questions. First on Advertising & Sponsorship. You're 80% sold out at this point, and it's July. Can you just help us think through the cadence of the growth for 3Q and 4Q? And, obviously, 3Q is seasonally strong and you have the Yahoo! deal, but if could you just help us think through the cadence of the growth and also the margin profile for 3Q and 4Q? And then my second question is on Artist Nation. Can you just help us walk through the reduction in the quarter related to the VIP and the outsourcing? And is that something that we should be thinking about going forward? And then I guess, the 2 acquisitions that you made in the Artist Management business.
Joe Berchtold: Sure. So on the -- let me work backwards, on the Artist Nation, I think we stopped doing some VIP and other programs in that business. The concert business decided that it was better to do it in-house as part of their touring activities. So it's within -- still the overall Live Nation activity is occurring, it's just a shift, really, from your perspective. There was a bit then of other just tiny seasonality on some of the merchandise sales side and the overall Artist Management, but again, that's just timing similar to our concerts timing a bit first versus second versus third quarter. We expect that piece of it to catch up without any issues. On the advertising and sponsorship piece. So when we say 80% sold, that is against the total Sponsorship & Advertising that we expect to be sold for the year. We sold about 80% of it today. That's pretty consistent with what we would have sold last year in terms of the percent total sale. It's early front half loaded for the sale of it, the execution and revenue recognition of that Sponsorship & Advertising then takes place in a cadence over the course of the full year. I think for the second half, we gave the numbers, and we expect our total AOI growth to be consistent with the past few years. I think as we start to see some scaling on the advertising side of it, you see the margins in the back half looking more like the margins would have last year. I think in totality, I don't have all the numbers in front of me, that would put us sort of slightly lower margin, but still in the kind of the 65% to 70% range for the business for the year.
Elizabeth K. Willard: And Amy, on that Live Nation activity, we moved that out in third quarter of last year, so you'll be consistent year-over-year from that plan.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Joyce with International Strategy and Investment Group.
David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of things. On the excess free cash that you have now after the convert redemption, how quickly do you expect to deploy that? Is the majority of that going to go through the Latin American opportunities you've mentioned earlier, or perhaps by the end of the year? How should we think about that?
Michael Rapino: Well, there's no timeline. Our job has been to grow the business over the last few years, start to generate some considerable cash flow that we can invest back in the business. We've been doing that, and we are always running around the world looking at opportunities in all of our markets that we think can help grow our business. So no timeline. If the opportunity is right, and we think it's an asset that can help leverage our core businesses within, we would look to do something. But we have a strong global platform. We're going to grow this business organically and the rest of the acquisitions are opportunistic if we think they can help accelerate growth in any of our course.
David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: All right. And separately, the international events independents were down in the low double digits in the second quarter. Is that primarily where you're seeing the shifting of events? I know you've talked about having more stadium events in the third quarter, so does that mean the stadium events were internationally based? I was just wondering if any festivals of note were shifting into the third quarter.
Michael Rapino: No. I mean, generally, when we look at the year, we tend to have a good view on the year obviously, by March and April, we tend to know kind of what is exactly going to be going on throughout the year from a stadium to a festival to an arena tour. And nothing inconsistent in any business that we didn't predict, meaning whatever is soft or down slightly in Q2 was probably up in Q1 in the arenas in Europe. We will be stronger in Q3 in the back end festivals in Europe. So again, just on an annual basis, we see a totality of all the different segments will be growing.
David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And finally, I don't think you've mentioned it, but when do you think you'll be done with the sort of incremental or the doubling of expenses on that Ticketmaster replant forming? Has that been accelerated somewhat?
Joe Berchtold: David, it's Joe. With regards to the stand on Ticketmaster, I think, at this point, we feel like we've gotten through the bulk of that spend as it relates to revamping the core search inventory management system checkout, and we now deployed major product using the new technology meaning the TicketMaster-Plus. What we're also seeing is that as a technology business, you have to continue to deploy great new products, and you see TicketMaster-Plus with their view from the seats and other innovations and the mobile coming out with new products. So as Kathy gave you guidance on with overall CapEx levels, I think you'll see some continued investment in Ticketmaster as we go forward given the nature of its business today.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Evercore.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Kathy, the number that jumps out to me is the SG&A number in totality up 10% and particularly, I mean you site some acquisitions as driving big increase in SG&A at Artist Nation. Was that -- I mean, is the SG&A in line with your expectation? And is this part of the whole timing issue where you continue to spend, because you expect to get a lot of the revenues back in the third quarter? Can you just put some perspective on that?
Elizabeth K. Willard: Yes, there's some FX impact, which we've called out. That's impacting that, but yes, it's timing within Ticketmaster, it's timing at some third-party consulting, in corporate. And yes, it's in line with where we expected this year to be at this point. And obviously, another thing I mentioned, I guess was the, we had some legal settlements in Ticketing last year, which we have reduction on those costs. And so year-over-year, there is an increase on that.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay, right. And then in terms of the specific increase in Artist Nation, I mean could you site some acquisition-related reasons, but I mean that really jumped up a lot in that smaller segment.
Joe Berchtold: Yes. I think there's some timing there in terms of some payouts that we had with some managers on some of these acquisitions that made it much lumpier than you would normally expect SG&A to be.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company.
Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division: Real quick. With the cash available expanding to $910 million, you have the convertible call coming up. Does it make -- since your leverage ratio is way down, does it make any sense to take on some debt and restructure the balance sheet a little bit and buy back some stock?
Elizabeth K. Willard: Rick, I think that's what we did in May, getting ready for that convertible coming up. And because we felt the market was right, and we've got good pricing on it, we borrow that from now, which is obviously driving a lot of that free cash, which is the $500 million that we just recently borrowed.
Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division: Second question. Have you guys been investigating at all the ability of Live Nation to take some real assets and turn them into REITs?
Joe Berchtold: Yes, we've analyzed this over time. It sounds good on theory, but we don't actually really own real estate. Both of the business you see when we say we own and operate is just city leases. So Jones beach in New York, we don't own that asset we're just having it leased to operate it, and all the economics are in the operation of it. So if you tried to take any of those assets and put them in another REIT, you have no core business operating revenue coming back to you. So we have looked at it over the years, we don't have enough assets that would produce the return we would expect.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Martin Pyykkonen with Rosenblatt Securities.
Martin Pyykkonen: I don't know if you said this, but as far as Q3 that we're now another point here in Q2 was hard fewer concert arena shows. Can you at all quantify how much more you have as far as the shows, the number shows and/or for Q3? I'm not talking about ticket goals. And then looking into Q4, I speak if I remember it last year this time, Q4 was looking pretty good from a show inventory standpoint. I'm wondering how that looks this year and what you're sort of factoring into your guidance for the full year, probably can back until you just maybe pull out Q4 even though it's far off, I'm not talking again about tickets sold, or the outlook for ticket sales in the Q4, just for show inventory.
Michael Rapino: Yes. So on Q3, what we said is we expect to sell sorry about 23, sorry about that -- have attendance of about 23 million fans. So collectively through the first 3 quarters we're up 4% year-on-year. I believe last year's Q3 attendance was just over 21 million. I don't have the exact number in front of me. As regards to Q4, we think it's solid, there's still of pieces of that in motion, but we think -- we'll be solid and will lead to what I said is a double-digit growth in concerts AOIs for the full year.
Martin Pyykkonen: Okay. And just, I know it's not a big number in the big picture for you, but the alley form was in your backyard almost about 6 months now starting with the eagles. Can you talk at all about what your sort of market share is, number shows are actually going on there with respect for capacity utilization. And I'm assuming you have pretty good market share. Obviously, it is in the area a bit more dedicated to stable and so forth. Any color on the alley form in terms of how that is going for you and how meaningful.
Michael Rapino: When we back for the MSG, the call. We're -- MSG in general is a great partner to us both in New York and L.A.. They are long-term and continued Ticketmaster and TicketMaster-Plus clients, and we have been very successful and in form this year promoting a lot of concerts in that venue. So any place the ticket is sold under Ticketmaster with our concert the economics are good for us. So the venue has been a success for us, we've sold lots of tickets, and it's good to have another option in any market for our content.
Operator: And we'll hear again from Rich Tullo from Albert Fried & Company.
Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division: The last time you talked about market share in the secondary market, you're around 10%. Are we approaching a number like 20%, 25% now?
Joe Berchtold: Well, we said it's up 30% for the first half and expect it to be 30% for the full year. So maybe 30% to 10%, it's not quite that high yet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time.
Michael Rapino: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-05-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Carrie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements relating to the Company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the Company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact to the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation for the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release, reconciliations and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Investor Relations tab on investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to our conference call. Coming off a record year in 2013, we are continuing this momentum, with first quarter revenue growth of 22%, AOI growth of 56% and free cash flow, up 138%. And all four divisions delivered revenue and AOI growth for the quarter. As we look forward, all signs point to us delivering on our growth targets for 2014. In concerts, our deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was up 14%, and ticket sales through May 2nd are up 5% year-on-year. In Sponsorship and Advertising, our contracted revenue through April was up 10% over last year, and in ticketing, our net renewal rate continues at over 100%, and at Artist Nation, we are on track to grow market share and come up 30% more shows in 2014. I will now provide you with update on our core growth strategies. We expect to continue growing our global market share this year. Following our success of adding 10 million fans in 2013 concerts. Our research shows, continued strong fan demand for all live events on a global basis, with a continued strong pipeline of great artists. We expect the Live Events business to continue being a robust growth industry, and having the two leading brands of Live Nation and Ticketmaster position us strongly in the center of this growth. And as we head into this summer, the business looks strong again, as evidenced by selling 500,000 tickets in three days last week for the Jay-Z and Beyoncé tour alone. And we will continue to grow market share three ways. First, we will continue growing our share in touring from clubs to stadiums. We expect to promote over 80% of the top 25 tours globally this year. Secondly, we will continue to grow our festival portfolio, with 5 million fans across 63 festivals, Live Nation is the largest festival producer in the world, and we expect to grow this fan base by 10% this year. Our portfolio of 18 electronic festivals continues to be quite strong, led by Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, which is the largest electronic festival in the world, with over 400,000 tickets sold for a three day festival. And third, we will continue our market expansion and enter new markets. Collectively, our global concert platform has never been stronger, as we will promote over 23,000 shows in 40 countries, with 3,000 artists in 2014, and we continue to add more markets, festivals and shows to this platform. Our artist management business is becoming increasingly strategic to our pipeline of the concert business. This division now, in 2014, will promote over 30% more shows than they did in last year. So we are continuing to see this division as a feeding to our main concert division, which ultimately drives our on-site sponsorship and ticketing business. Our artist management division is a global leader, managing over 250 artists, and we expect to continue adding to this portfolio, as it supports our core business. The third driver of our business is the rapid growth of our sponsorship advertising and digital business. Our advertising business continues to grow rapidly, the 13% increase in ad units sold during the first quarter, as we increase total traffic to our platform by 14%. This growth was driven by large commitments from major brands like [indiscernible] Ford and O2, and from our digital platform growth. We continue to offer unique proposition for advertisers, who want to engage with fans at scale on digital and on-site. In last week, we took a major step forward in transforming our advertising business towards a true media and content company, with the announcement of our Live Nation channel on Yahoo! While others have streamed shows in the past, only Live Nation, with the scale of 23,000 shows globally, can consistently deliver programming and establish a network with an ongoing advertising base. With this channel, we company-sell the advertising. So our advertising team has new ad units to sell, and we are attracting large commitments, that will drive advertising revenue from day one from this channel. I expect that our venture with Yahoo! proves successful. You will see us further leverage our content in Live Nation brand accelerating the growth of our advertising business. And in Ticketmaster, our focus continues to be global growth, in developing new features and products to gain share and conversion. Top of our list for 2014 continues to be our integrated inventory product, Ticketmaster Resale. In a recent survey, over 90% of fans indicated they would find it valuable to see all of their ticket options in one location. A service we are uniquely positioned to provide, and now do. With 60 teams from the NFL, NBA and NHL and over 2,000 concerts now officially offering fans all verified options at Ticketmaster, we continue to see rapid adoption of both content and fans. Looking at our most recent results for the month of April, we grew our global resale volume at 40% relative to April 2013, and we are tracking towards what we expect to be $1 billion in resale GTV from the launch last September through this year. Growing market share, while we invest and evolve the Ticketmaster platform and product remains on plan. We are building this new platform in a modular fashion, and expect several key products to be deployed this year. For consumers, the new platform is powering the Ticketmaster Resale product, as well as other features on mobile, that will enhance search, purchase and checkout. And we will also deploy new products for our venue clients, with additional analytics and marketing products in 2014. I remain confident that the investment to date has been key to delivering Ticketmaster's renewal, as well as providing a foundation for new products and features, that continue growing Ticketmaster's global business; with Ticketmaster Resale being the first proof-of-concept. We will continue to see operating reductions that we need to deliver our strategic plans. These cost reductions will start to have a meaningful impact in 2014, and will be important contributors to Ticketmaster's profitability this year. Given our momentum coming out of 2013, our strong early success with Q1 and solid leading indicators, I am confident in 2014, we will deliver our fourth consecutive year of revenue, AOI and free cash flow growth. Grow the profitability of each our businesses; stay on track to deliver on 2015 financial targets; operationally continue to invest and build all of our businesses, to set them up for continued growth. I will now turn the call over to Joe Berchtold, our COO, to take you through an update on the divisions.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks Michael. First, Concerts; Live Nation Concerts revenue for the first quarter was up 29%, and AOI improved by 80% versus 2013, driven by an 11% increase in global attendance at our shows. In North America, attendance was up 30%, with a 34% increase in arena attendance, led by tours with Justin Timberlake, Imagine Dragons and Luke Bryan. Internationally, attendance was up 8%, driven by an 18% increase in arena attendance. Europe, particularly France and the U.K., led this growth with tours, with Depeche Mode, Michael Bublé, Beyoncé and Drake. Through May 2nd, global ticket sales for all shows are up 5% through the same time in 2013, and the global growth has been across all venue types, with nine artists already selling over 500,000 tickets for the year, led by One Direction, Justin Timberlake, Luke Bryan and Miley Cyrus. Through April, we sold approximately half our tickets for the year, and based on sales to-date in our pipeline, we expect to deliver continued attendance growth for the full year. We expect that this growth, along with improved performance in our festival business, will deliver strong growth in our 2014 concerts profitability. One other point to note on concerts is the seasonality of the business this year, with a significant shift from Q2 into both Q1 and Q3. As I mentioned, arena attendance was the primary driver of our growth in Q1, thanks to a 10% increase in arena show count. In Q3, we expect to see strong growth in both festivals and stadium attendance, with all growth in festival attendance projected for the third quarter, and stadium attendance projected to increase by over 50% for the quarter. As a result, Q2 will be impacted by the shift out of arena activity into Q1 and festival and stadium activity into Q3. On Artist Nation, for the quarter, revenue was up 44% and our AOI was $5 million compared to a loss of $1 million last year, driven by the artist management business. In 2014, we expect improved AOI from the artist management, Artist Nation division, from a growing roster of artists under management. Turning to our Sponsorship and Advertising business; for the first quarter, revenue for the division was up 13%, with sponsorship sales up 13% and online revenue up 12%. AOI was up 8%, and AOI growth was slightly lower than revenue for the quarter because of headcount increases, particularly for online advertising, where we have added staff in anticipation of building our online content. We expect this additional headcount to deliver strong growth in online advertising in the second half of the year, as we expand our programming with Yahoo!, launched additional content verticals, and build on our current Live Nation and Ticketmaster sites. Similarly, we expect festival sponsorship to continue growing rapidly, and for the full year, to increase by over 15%. At this point, we have sold approximately 75% of our expected sponsorship for the revenue for the year, and half of our planned online advertising sales. This puts us on plan to deliver our expected growth for the year. Finally, Ticketmaster; for the quarter, ticketing revenue increased 9%; AOI was up 17%, with primary ticket sales up 3% for the quarter, and growth transaction value of the primary tickets up 9%. The concert segment was the primary driver of our ticket growth, both in tickets sold and for the increased gross transaction value, given the pricing on concert tickets is generally higher than average ticket pricing. Geographically, our markets were fairly consistent with North America volume up 2% and gross transaction value up 8%, while international volume was up 3% and gross transaction value up 10%. On mobile, we continue to see a rapid shift of consumer behavior, now accounting for 16% of all tickets sold in the first quarter, up 33% from the same period last year. In North America, ticket sales grew by 26% and accounted for 18% of overall ticket sales, while in Europe, they grew by 69% and accounted for 13% of overall ticket sales. Based on the ticket sales in the first quarter and projections for the full year, we are currently expecting low single digit growth in ticket sales for the year, with AOI growth slightly higher than ticket growth. Overall, given the strength of our first quarter performance and more importantly, our visibility into the rest of the year, we believe we will again grow our businesses in 2014, and continue on track to deliver our three year plan in 2015. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Kathy Willard, to take you through more details on our financials.
Kathy Willard: Thanks Joe and good afternoon everyone. We had a strong start to fiscal 2014, with growth across all of our operating segments. I will provide further details on the first quarter results, and then summarize our current expectations for the full year. For the first quarter, revenue was $1.1 billion, up 22% over the same period last year. This increase was led by concerts, which improved by 29% compared to the prior year, from an increase in arena shows globally, and higher overall attendance. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter grew 56% to $83 million as compared to $53 million in 2013, and this growth was led by our concerts and ticketing segments. Concerts AOI improved 80% to a loss of $2.6 million, due to higher overall attendance, along with increased average attendance per show. Specifically to arenas in North America and Europe. Ticketing AOI was up 17% to $70 million, due to increased ticket volume and higher average pricing. Sponsorship and Advertising AOI was up 8% to $26 million, with growth in both North America and Europe; and Artist nation AOI was up $6 million from the management business. The improved performance in our AOI drove a 63% improvement in our operating income for this first quarter, as we reported an operating loss of $12 million, compared to a loss of $33 million last year. And the growth in our AOI, translated to the bottom line, as our net loss for the quarter, improved by $31 million over 2013, to a loss of $32 million. The improvement in the net loss was driven by our higher operating income in the first quarter, lower interest expense, due to the refinancing of our debt in Q3 of last year, and a discrete one time tax benefit of $7 million, related to deferred tax liabilities recorded from an acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2014. Cash flow also expanded with our AOI growth. Free cash flow was $34 million in the first quarter, compared to $14 million last year, with the improvement driven by our higher AOI, with some timing impacts on interest payments in the first quarter of this year. And cash flow from operations was $366 million for the year-to-date, up $95 million over 2013. This improvement is due to the increase in AOI, higher deferred revenue from ticket sales for future events, and timing of artist deposits, which were lower in the first quarter of 2014 compared to last year. As of March 31, we had total cash of $1.6 billion, which includes $569 million in ticketing client cash and $697 million in net concert event related cash. Our free cash was $363 million. Total event related deferred revenue was $885 million as of March 2014, as compared to $774 million in March last year. Due to an overall increase in ticket sales for 2014 events, which are up 10% as compared to March 2013. This deferred revenue in concert ticket sales to-date, give us confidence, that this will be a strong concert season. Our total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $21 million. We spent approximately $11 million on maintenance capital expenditures and $10 million on revenue generating addition. We currently continue to expect that our total capital expenditures for 2014, will be app $130 million for the full year, with under half of that spend on revenue generating projects. As of March 31, our total current and long term debt, including capital leases was $1.8 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discount and including debt premiums, is 4.3%. Our debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage ratio of 5.25 times, and we are comfortably in compliance of less than 3.5 times. We delivered strong results for the first quarter of 2014. Looking forward, we expect to drive growth across each of our businesses, and increase overall profitability, while continuing to invest in our long term growth strategies. We expect the positive trend this quarter to continue throughout 2014, and we currently expect to deliver solid growth in concert AOI. As Joe mentioned, we had an increase in early arena shows, shifting event activity on a comparable basis from the second quarter to the first. Additionally, we currently expect to have higher stadium activity in the third quarter, which will shift more activity out of Q2. The growth trend in sponsorship and advertising AOI is expected to continue in 2014 at historical rates. We expect ticketings AOI to be slightly up compared to 2013, as we grow our secondary ticket sales and deliver cost savings. We expect Artist Nation to grow its profitability this year as well. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Amy Yong with Macquarie Capital.
Andrew DeGasperi: Yes hi, this is Andrew for Amy. I just had two questions, the first one, if maybe you can quantify the synergies that you expect from the replatforming of Ticketmaster this year? And also, can you comment on StubHub's recent initiatives, including the all-in pricing and concert series with Pandora? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: On the first, with regards to not so much synergies, but the cost savings as we continue our replatforming, as we have talked several times now. The replatforming project is really an ongoing one that we have broken into a modular basis, so we can start both getting the consumer and venue benefits through new products as well as taking some costs out. So I would say, that our expectations at this point for this year is about a 10% -- sorry a $0.10 per ticket reduction in our costs for our fee-bearing tickets in North America.
Andrew DeGasperi: Great. And the second one?
Michael Rapino: On the -- I don't have a ton of input on what they are up to, and their strategy. But all-in pricing, we have had all-in pricing available to our clients for the last couple of years, depending on the artists, the team, they want to put all in pricing at the front of the proposition. We do that, we leave it in the hands of the client, while at times, it is -- the position is all in, but we break out the pieces to make it transparent. So we don't think all in pricing, either way, changes much on the purchase intent, but we have it as an option for the clients, if they want to position it that way. But we don't think it does much either way. I don't know what they are up to on their Pandora concert series, I assume they are just looking for some brand extension, but we are very thrilled with the progress we are making on our secondary market share.
Andrew DeGasperi: Great. Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee.
Vasily Karasyov: Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could clarify the metric that you provided, that you have a 40% increase in secondary market, total value I believe. When you disclosed at the Analyst Day, I think last year, that you estimate that you have 10% of secondary tickets. Was that true for April last year, or was your share less than 10% at that point?
Joe Berchtold: I think when we talked about the 10% share that we were looking at the year in its entirety, as you can tell from the numbers that Michael gave, we have been substantially growing our activity each month, since we have been launching our Ticketmaster Resale last fall; because of the seasonality difference, sports league on at different times, we wanted to give that April-to-April comparison, so that you have an understanding of versus April of last year, before we launched Ticketmaster retail to April of this year, the most recent full month that it has been going, that we increased our global secondary growth transaction value 40% year-over-year.
Vasily Karasyov: And do you expect to provide this update every quarter, or do you think its going to be a one-off kind of illustration?
Michael Rapino: I mean, we will try to provide the information we think is most relevant. So that you all and our investors can take a read on the progress that we are making.
Vasily Karasyov: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Doug Arthur with Evercore.
Doug Arthur: Joe, I want to go back to -- you're giving guidance sort of low single digit concert ticket sales for the year, based on your read right now, and then you made a comment about AOI for the year of somewhat better. Were you referring -- then you were talking about a dramatic, significant increase in concert profitability. So is the somewhat better AOI description for the entire company, I just want your clarity on that?
Joe Berchtold: I think we had said on concerts, that we would have a strong increase in concerts division AOI, off of the continued fan growth that we have this year. We obviously, just from our current profitability of our concerts division, will tend to increase AOI to a higher percentage than our fan base. I think the overall message that we were trying to give on a totality, is that we continue on plan with what we have been consistently laying out, and we think that we are off to a very strong start, that gives us some good tailwind to deliver those results this year. And -- indicator to support that.
Doug Arthur: And so, the first quarter, which is obviously seasonally small, you're up 56% in AOI. I guess the commentary strongly suggests that you're going to give some of that, if not a fair amount of that back in Q2 and then, kind of recapture on that in Q3. I am just trying to get a read here of kind of --?
Joe Berchtold: I think that's roughly right. As you said, Q1 is seasonally low, when you look at the overall level of activity for concerts, just relative to the overall year. But I think in general, you got it right. We had a really strong Q1. We have a really strong Q3, and what we have seen just from a show-count perspective is, I gave the detail on, just seasonally less. Nothing more, nothing less than that, just timing.
Doug Arthur: Okay. And then finally, on Artist Nation, I mean, this is -- you have been in a year long, kind of reshaping of that business, revenues were up 2% in 2012. They were down 12% in 2013. So now we are looking at a big pop in the first quarter. I know, a lot of that can't be timing associated with the concert tours. But are we having -- is this kind of a completely new platform at this point, and should we expect strong revenue growth for the year, or is that not the read?
Michael Rapino: I think what we are trying to be very clear about is, Artist Nation on itself is the division of 15 or 16 management companies, that manage over 250 artists. We spent the year taking out a lot of services and non-core businesses that weren't core to the artist management business; VIP business, merchandise business, graphic artists, things that were in that division that we didn't believe could grow within there. So we took those out, and we have a very strong single minded Artist Nation division, that it wakes up every day, managing great artists, and furthering their careers. What we did say is, we don't believe that division has high growth in it organically. We believe that we are going to run it better, and we are going to add a few artists and continue to change up the portfolio and add some artists that we think have a long term perspective. But the most important thing was that division is kind of over the last year, when the silos got broken down. We were able to embrace that division to a level we hadn't heard historically. And that division's main goal is, with 250 artists, you can now capture and co-op into touring with you, supporting your ticketing proposition and supporting your sponsorship division. There is nothing better than 250 fabulous artists feeding your main pipeline. And that is the structural change that has happened, is that division now reporting directly to me, is much more integrated in our sponsorship, our ticketing and our concert division. So we believe, having 250 strong artists, as a high margin business, generates nice AOI, is a stable and strong business on itself, but more importantly, the numbers we keep telling you, but over the last two years, since we have kind of taken it over, we have doubled the amount of shows that those 250 artists do, that are now touring with Live Nation versus our competitors. So we believe, its an incredible, strong division on its own, but when linked to our core business, can drive profitability in our core concert business on its own, and then ticketing and sponsorship. So if you took last year's number and we were up 25%, we are going to be up 30%. If those 250 artists combined have a few thousand concerts, and now we have gone from promoting 300 of them to 600 of them, that's a great supply chain; and we believe that if we add value to that division, we will continue to gather more concert market share from that division, if we have the best product out there. And that, in itself, even in the core business, you don't see reflected in the Artist Nation financials, but you do obviously see it reflected in our increased market share in our concert division.
Doug Arthur: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Joyce with International Strategy and Investment Group.
David Joyce: Thank you very much. Your attendance per event was up again nicely, both North America and internationally. How much would you attribute that to the Ticketmaster replatforming and increased conversion, and how much would you be attributing that to macroeconomic trends or other factors?
Joe Berchtold: I think a couple of factors David. Clearly we believe, that as we continue to develop new products at Ticketmaster, online, the Ticketmaster plus the mobile; we are continuing to give more kind of a better experience for consumers and a better experience that makes the purchase easier. It is always going to help conversion some, is one. Two is, we continue to be very focused on shifting more of our marketing spend to digital and social platforms, using that database that we have on fan interest, fan behavior, historical purchase patterns, what they have on their iPhones, to do a better job, making them aware, getting them interested in the show. And then, third would be, kind of, what's the mix of artists that you have in some of the macro environment.
David Joyce: Thanks. And on the type of events, that are growing for you. The festivals, the summer, for example, is that an area where the growth in sponsorship advertising revenue might be more focused, given that you've talked about that being an area where there is more [indiscernible] upside?
Michael Rapino: Yes, absolutely. We have always been very strong in Europe with our festival platform. Our festival platform has been our main driver to our advertising business in Europe, and as we are adding more and more festivals in America and Canada and Australia, we know that our advertising proposition gets stronger, and we have seen that already come to life, with our Insomniac acquisition for some of our new countries festivals, or Made in America with Jay-Z festivals are a great platform for advertisers, and we will continue to build up that portfolio.
David Joyce: Thanks. And just finally on the Artist Nation strength, with the increase in commissions there, was that related to the artists performing or at arenas or was it more clubs, how would you characterize where the growth opportunities have been coming there?
Joe Berchtold: Part of it is timing for us, with the activity. But in general, its just where our artists, the managers are -- where those artists are active in a particular quarter, there is nothing magical about it.
Michael Rapino: And just on the economics of that, as we have said many times, the artist is making most of its money on the road. So if my business in general, on a global basis is continuing to grow and Maroon 5s and Rihannas have more and more opportunities to tour, make more money, then the largest part of your commission is going to be your touring business. So a manager going forward is going to have an increased business, just off the basics that his artist is a good touring artist, the tour -- the artist is going to have more revenue and more growth in the future.
David Joyce: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company.
Rich Tullo: Hey guys. Got one question; in regards to seasonality, it looks like you ran about 5% ahead of my model on first quarter attendance. Looking at seasonality as a percentage of total revenue for the year, I guess this is for Kathy. When you talk about the second quarter, are we talking at something like 100 to 200 basis points was transferred into the first quarter and something like 100 basis points will be transferred into the third quarter?
Joe Berchtold: This is Joe, I don't think we are getting that specific. I think what we said is, we had a strong first quarter that we were very happy with. All the leading indicators that we have locked through [ph], point to continued strength through the rest of the year, and we are just trying to, every year, round this time we have a conversation that says, what does the seasonality look like, because we manage it for the total year, not for the given quarters. And this year, its particularly strong in the third quarter, as I talked about festivals and stadiums. Strong in the first quarter, and so by definition, some of that has to come out in the second quarter. But in totality, everything pointing to ongoing growth and strength.
Rich Tullo: Yeah, there is a question about that --
Joe Berchtold: Now --
Michael Rapino: We know we are trying to fill out, we got it. We are trying to help you, but we are just going to not -- we'd only get caught exactly on 100 shows versus this month versus next, in an overall thesis right now.
Rich Tullo: All right. Okay. I am not asking you to point the wrong finger here, but to point the finger on the EDM, are you thinking about festivals, in terms of more of an experiential marketing, and an advertising plan, versus just kind of a sponsorship and pouring rights. I mean, is that where we are headed with this, and if that's the case, is that going to be kind of an announcement data point, or you are just going to let the numbers surprise, if this transpires?
Michael Rapino: Not even quite sure what you're asking, but I could try to answer what I think you are asking. But help me out here, what are you asking about EDM exactly?
Rich Tullo: Well I mean, it just seems to me that the opportunity with sponsorships is more than just banners and pouring rights, right? The opportunity is to develop a one-to-one communication between the concert grower and the advertiser, in ways that is not necessarily available in a two-hour venue?
Michael Rapino: Absolutely. I think if you look at our business, its what we have been doing for many years. I mean, our business model, whether its an EDM festival or country festival, stadium show or a house of blues, our main job is to create that 23,000 show flywheel that spits out 60 million to 70 million consumers on-site. And from that scale of consumer base, we built 800 plus sponsors, and many of those sponsors are much deeper than a banner ad as you know. They are very integrated programs like the Ford Rider series, which is a whole content program, online series we created for Ford to the American Express front of the line, through the Starwood upgrade, while you purchase a ticket to stay at a Starwood hotel, through upselling a Hertz rental car. So we have got an incredible sponsor base, who want to participate in many of the different genres, and you know, the beautiful part of what our model is, is diversity. A 19 year old or 30 year old or a 40 year old, doesn't live in one genre. Most 19 year olds love Taylor Swift, when they are feeling love sick and they want to party with the latest EDM artist, and they head over to a Rihanna show for pop. So our basics is, when we talk to sponsors, its about the scale of the 19-year old we have, and the amount we can touch, incredible sponsorship programs for 800 sponsors, and then the way we are going to touch and communicate to those customers, is why we always believe in our Ticketmaster strategy, is we have 400 million consumers buying an average of $163 ticket directly for us. We know their name, we have their credit card, we have a communication platform with them. We have now on-site apps at Live Nation and Ticketmaster that are doing more and more for you on-site, and you can see in the future, the value we can bring to the Live Nation Ticketmaster app, whether its upgrading your seat when you are at the venue, whether its buying T-shirts cashless, ordering drinks. So we have already got the scale. We have got the LN and Ticketmaster brands and mobile applications that are talking directly to you ongoing. We have 800 powerful sponsors, who want to participate in that. So we are not obsessed with any specific genre around creating a one-on-one. We are very obsessed with having massive scale, that lets us talk to a lot of consumers about a lot of shows. Now within those brands, House of Blues, Insomniac, lot of our European festivals, they all have their own apps, their own websites and their own customer bases, that they do a great job on a one-to-one basis, talking directly to them, that's kind of a sub-brand. So we have a lot of sub-brands, but we have the scale of the master brands, that really is how we have unlocked the 800 sponsors, and are unlocking our 400 million plus database.
Rich Tullo: One quick little question. It might not be an easy question to answer, but what percentage of the growth we have been seeing over the last, let's call it 18 months, has been from social marketing, which are doing evidently very well. Deals like Yahoo!, if you could provide a little color on that, and what percentage is coming from the expansion of the big data from Ticketmaster. I mean, can you quantify it or qualify it inn any way?
Michael Rapino: We are not breaking that data out specific, it’s a lot of our secret sauce; because no one else in the industry would have the breadth of resources and data that we have. But we have said it out loud over the last couple of years that we believe the greatest opportunity we have, is 23,000 shows and a Ticketmaster, well over 100,000 events on sale, the greatest opportunity we have to grow this business, is to sell 10 more tickets to each event. You sell an extra 10, 20, 30 tickets to -- our 20,000 shows or Ticketmaster's 100,000 plus shows, those are millions of dollars to the bottom line, incremental high margin. And we believe the route to get there, was always the unsophisticated industry becoming more sophisticated with the way it markets and talks to its customers. So taking the three year ago historic unsophisticated industry that spend all their money on print and radio and [indiscernible] shotgun, to this year, we are tracking well over 40% of our marketing spend is now -- lets call it one to one digital, advertising directly to those 90 million Rihanna fans, when you have a Rihanna concert. Talking to them directly through our database, and finding like minded Rihanna facts and activating them. You look three years ago, we sent a billion emails a year, with basically the same campaign, and in 2013, we sent over 1.5 billion emails, and we had over 900 campaigns, customized to different customers to different targets with different offers. And most of those are ending up in a young kid's mobile phone, with some rich video or visuals, and the open rate of conversion is incredibly encouraging. So we do believe that yes, a lot of it is just us, using our data, our customer research and converting our marketing spend to be much more efficient and try to find those 10 or 15 casual fans, that are thinking to go to a Rihanna, but we weren't hitting them with a billboard on sunset, we are hitting with a very direct marketing campaign, and we have got tons of engineers working on algorithms, to figure out how to keep finding a casual and non-buying Rihanna fan, and get her to the next show. And we think the data will be the sweet spot and the unique differentiator on how we bring more and more fans to those current shows.
Rich Tullo: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Tinker with Maxim.
John Tinker: Thanks. Terrific quarter. Congratulations. Could you just clarify a little more, how your deal with Yahoo! is going to work? Are you going to own the content that's streamed, or do the artists own that?
Michael Rapino: Sure. Thanks John for asking. We are wildly excited. We spent the last couple of years, talking to a lot of different distributors, the obvious ones on, could we repackage some of our content, and not just provide it as a production fee, to help someone else's platform. But could we partake in the branding and the advertising. Kathy and Melissa saw the vision. The deal is in the simplest context, is they have agreed to underwrite the cost to deliver the content and shoot it. Obviously, we have already invested in the show, so we have done our part. We will then co-sell the advertising units, and we will show that on a 50-50 basis, once Yahoo! has recovered its cost basis. We are very encouraged, because we are highly subscribed already, talking to advertisers before we launched it. That's why we you saw me referencing my script, that we will -- this will be a positive revenue channel, almost A-1, and we get our Live Nation branding, which is very important to continue to show 800 sponsors and others, that we have the potential to take these 23,000 shows behind the scenes, on the stage and etcetera, to bundle up some great content. The deal is with Yahoo! The content is owned by both of us for the first, kind of broadcast of it, and then we will revert the rights back to the artist after a certain time period. So part of the value to the artist and keeping kind of the cost upfront low, is let us shoot your show. We don't plan on paying you. We are going to bring incredible audience to your show. We are going to shoot it quality, and we are going to let you reuse that content, when that was done.
John Tinker: Great. Thank you.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, John.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Doug Arthur with Evercore.
Doug Arthur: Yes. Joe, I just want to go back to you, some of your nuance comment on the third quarter. The --
Joe Berchtold: Hey Doug.
Doug Arthur: Well the thing is, in the first quarter, the number of shows, the attendee per show were all sort of kind of on-trend. The big delta was the revenue per attendee was up 16%, it has been trending down year-over-year for the last few quarters. So obviously the arena, you have mentioned newer size of the arena impact in the first quarter. Is it -- the revenue per attendee, obviously, its hard to calculate a couple of quarters out? But I mean, is that something that could be based on the skew of shows you're seeing right now for Q3, and obviously at the festivals, etcetera. Could that be a positive surprise in the third quarter or is it too early to tell, get that refined on the mix?
Joe Berchtold: So a couple of things. First of all, the first quarter as you said, there is obviously some mix in there; and the first quarter what you have, is really indoor, so you're seeing arenas, and theaters and clubs. But if you skew towards arenas, you will see just from that mix issue, some increased attendants per show and increased revenue per attendee, generally those ticket prices are going to be higher. So that's part of what you will see in the first quarter. As I talk about the third quarter, when I talked about being strong in the third quarter in particular, were festivals, and seeing our festival growth in the third quarter in stadium, and a lot of our stadium growth in the third quarter. Both of those venue types, just at a broad level, are high ticket price; because you are buying the more expensive full day ticket to the festival, and on average, your stadium pricing is going to be higher than your arena or amphitheater. So you should see some positive revenue per ticket or per ticket pricing from a mix in Q3 yet.
Doug Arthur: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Rapino for closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: All right. Thank you everybody and we will talk to you all in Q2.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation entertainment first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Michael Rapino: Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year conference call. We had a record year in 2013 and are well positioned for continued growth in 2014. During 2013 we grew our concert fan base by 10 million, attracting almost 60 million fans to our concerts, the Ticketmaster managing nearly 400 million total tickets. Combined we delivered a record year for revenue, AOI and free cash flow. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our business model, establishing Live Nation as what we believe to be the number one player in each of our businesses, with concerts driving our flywheel which then is monetized across our high margin onsite sponsorship and ticketing businesses. We continue to see tremendous power of live events, with strong consumer global demand. Data shows that live events are a high priority for discretionary spend, and over 80% of our fans surveyed indicate that they plan on attending the same or more events in 2014 as in 2013. Another sign of the strength of our business is that 85% of Live Nation’s fan growth came organically, by promoting more shows, launching new festivals and entering new markets. We believe the live business will continue up strong global demand for years to come, as fan demand, artist supply and new markets come together. Another reason for the strength of live events is that technology has rapidly transformed the business in a positive fashion. Live is not duplicatable and new social platforms have enabled fans around the globe to get close to their favorite artists. Fans in every corner of the globe can discover, follow, share and embrace artists, translating into greater demand for tours in our markets because nothing compares to seeing your favorite artist live. As music has gone global, technology is enabling a similar transformation of ticketing. Today, the vast majority of ticketing, transactions are online via mobile. Ticket sales are continuing their rapid shift to mobile, almost doubling in 2013 to 14% of total ticket sales. Today fans are hearing about concerts either from friends or by digital 70% of the time. As Ticketmaster continues to improve its products for fans to buy and manage tickets digitally more fans will be able to found out about shows, coordinate with friends and go to more concerts or other events. And as a result Ticketmaster will sell more tickets, Ticketmaster clients will benefit from increased sales and Live Nation concerts will increase its attendance per show. We continue to build share across our concert business growing by 19% in 2013 more above the industry growth rate, as Live Nation promoted 21 of the top 25 grossing tours in North America. In addition we grew our festival portfolio over 1 million fans and we further expanded in new markets with an additional 1 million more fans, now reaching 33 countries. We grew the business across all markets and venue types, as well as across all genres and music with country music delivering the greatest fan growth, up 2.3 million fans to nearly 7 million, a 50% increase year-over-year. Our newer artists also contributed to our growth, and 7 of the top-10 tours were led by young artists. At Artist Nation the division became greater alignment with our core business in 2014, and we increased the number of shows we promoted with Artist Nation acts by 50%. This delivered increased value of approximately $20 million to our concerts and ticketing businesses, while providing additional opportunities for our sponsors. We now feel confident that with added leadership we will grow our artist management business in 2014 and it will continue to be a valuable pipeline into our concert flywheel. Our sponsorship & advertising business has now reached almost 300 million in revenue, connecting over 750 sponsors with 900 million visitors to our online and mobile sites and 60 million onsite fans. We now have the scale and unique online and onsite user base to attract a broad advertising base, which drove 26% increase in ad units in 2013. At the same time our traditional sponsorship business continues to show strength, growing 11% last year. This was led by a 29% increase in festival sponsorship. Ticketmaster also continues to build upon its strength with nearly 400 million tickets issued and generating over $17 billion in gross transaction value, making Ticketmaster one of the top e-commerce sites in the world. With 106% client net renewal rates in 2013, we continue to grow our B2B client base. Ticketmaster resale was the first new product launch enabled by our new platform and it delivered a 26% growth in secondary GTV. This product expansion of Ticketmaster wins all tickets primary and secondary together in one place creating increased options for our buying fans. We believe the $9 billion secondary market that has historically not benefited content owners will start to be captured by content and Ticketmaster resale will be at the forefront of empowering this. To-date we have partnered with two-thirds of the NFL, NBA and NHL teams, and over 1,000 concerts in launching this product in 2013. Our team of over 500 engineers continues to work on new mobile products; improving the online experience and building a new ticketing platform to enable Ticketmaster substantially upgrade its commerce site of features for both fans and B2B clients over the next two years. As we head into 2014, we are more optimistic than ever on the growth potential of our business and our ability to deliver the three year plan as laid out for 2014 and 2015. While we had tremendous success building our concert fan base in 2013, we believe there is more runway ahead of us that will allow us to continue to build share, add festivals and grow our global portfolio. Early indicators show we are off to a strong start, with event-related deferred revenue up 19% year-on-year to 434 million as of December 31st and concert ticket sales for shows in 2014 up 12% as of February 15th as compared to this time last year. We expect sponsorship and advertising to continue dependable growth at recent historical rates, further building our global sponsorship base and expanding our online ad units as we grow and extend our online and mobile presence. At Ticketmaster, we plan on delivering client net renewal rates of over 100% and see continued growth of our Ticketmaster resale GTV. Ticketmaster has also had a strong start to the year with overall ticket sales up 8% through February 15th on a year-over-year comparison. With that, I will turn it over to Joe Berchtold, our COO to take you through the additional details of our division.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. First on the overall financials, revenue grew 11%, 6.5 billion driven by our concerts business. AOI increased 10% to 505 million with growth across concert, sponsorship and ticketing and free cash flow grew 9% scaling with our AOI growth. Giving you a bit more detail on a couple of our businesses. First concerts, Live Nation concerts revenue for the year was 17% on 19% increase in fan attendance. AOI grew 92% to 60 million, driven by the higher fan base with both more shows and higher attendance per show. Looking at our concert business by market, first North America, attendance was up 18% or 5.9 million fans for the year within this our amphitheaters delivered 2.8 million more fans, totaling 13.9 million for the year. This came from a combination of 14% more shows for a total of over 2,200 shows and a 10% increase in attendance per show. Arenas also grew strongly, up 19% or 1.9 million fans for the year. Again this was of the combination of more shows up 12% for a total of almost 1,300 and 7% more fans per show. Festivals then accounted for most of the remaining growth, up almost 800,000 fans largely due to EDM activity. In our international markets attendance increased by 3.6 million fans or 20%, here two arenas were large driver of the growth, up 36% or 2.4 million fans to over 9 million total fans with a 20% increase in shows and a 13% increase in fans per show. The other large driver in our international markets was stadiums which grew by 29% to 3 million fans for the year. Globally in our core amphitheater, arena and stadium business, we added 600 shows and increased attendance per show by 11%. And on the festival side, we held 62 festivals globally, attracting 4.5 million fans, a 26% increase from 2012. Next Artist Nation, Artist Nation AOI for the year was $32 million, down 6 million from last year. On the artist management side of the business, we continue to deliver profit margins of over 20% and for the full year, this part of the business had a decline in profitability of 6 million which was due to the departure of 12 artists with management in December of 2012 and offset by savings elsewhere in the Company. But despite these departures, profits more than doubled in the fourth quarter and were up in the second half of 2013, as we had a double-digit increase in revenue in this part of our business. On the other side of the business, merchandise and other artist services our profitability declined by 2 million. These results were impacted by our decision to restructure these businesses in the first half making some management changes and ending activities that overlapped with what we do in the concerts division. As a result we believe these businesses are better positioned for growth going forward. Michael already covered the specifics on Sponsorship & Advertising and Ticketing; so I will now turn the call over to Kathy Willard to take you through more details on the financials.
Kathy Willard: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter revenue was 1.6 billion, up 12% over the same period in 2012, driven by Concerts growth of 18% coming from the higher show count and attendance and higher online advertising helped grow Sponsorship & Advertising revenue by another 15%. Adjusted operating income for the quarter grew 14% to 71 million with ticketing up 18% and Sponsorship & Advertising higher by 7%. Our operating income for the fourth quarter improved from a loss of 126 million last year to a loss of 51 million in 2013. This improvement came from our higher AOI, along with lower amortization expense due to higher impairments in 2012. Net loss for the quarter was 82 million compared to a loss of 116 million in 2012. Revenue for the full year was 6.5 billion, up 11% over 2012. The majority of this growth was in concerts, which was up 17%. Sponsorship & Advertising also delivered strong revenue growth up 15% for the year. Adjusted operating income for 2013 grew 10% to 505 million as compared to 459 million last year. Concerts AOI roughly doubled compared to last year, to 60 million driven by the strength in our shows and attendance delivering an AOI margin of 1.3% as compared to 0.8% in 2012. Sponsorship & Advertising’s AOI grew 11%, from higher online advertising revenue along with increases in festival and other sponsorship activity globally. We’re pleased to have delivered another double-digit growth year for this segment, while continuing to deliver high margins of 68%. Ticketing delivered AOI of 298 million, an increase of 1% along with a 1% increase in free bearing tickets sold and a consistent margin year-over-year over 21%. And Artist Nation delivered growth in AOI in the fourth quarter following our changes to the business in the first half of the year. For the full year 2013 our overall AOI margin was 8% in line with last year. Operating income for the year was 140 million compared to a loss of 22 million in 2012. This growth was driven by our higher AOI, lower amortization due to the 2012 impairments and a $38 million gain on disposal of operating assets primarily in our Concerts segment. The Net loss for 2013 was 43 million compared to a loss of 163 million last year. After adjusting for the cost related to refinancing our debt in the third quarter, our adjusted net loss for this year is 7 million, an improvement of 157 million over 2012. Our EPS improved from a loss of $0.87 per share in 2012 to a loss of $0.22 per share in 2013; and without the refinancing cost our 2013 adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.04, an improvement of $0.84 over last year. Free cash flow was 17 million in the fourth quarter compared to 1 million last year. For the full year free cash flow was 300 million compared to 276 million in 2012. And 2012 included 26 million in tax refunds. Excluding the 2012 tax refunds our free cash flow increased by 50 million due to our higher AOI along with lower cash interest this year. Our free cash flow as a percentage of AOI was 59% for 2013, in line with 2012. Cash flow from operations was 417 million for the full year as compared to 367 million last year, driven by our higher AOI. As of December 31st we had total cash of 1.3 billion which includes 538 million in ticketing client cash. Our free cash which excludes event-related cash for future shows was 445 million as compared to 340 million in 2012. This increase in free cash comes from our higher free cash flow, proceeds from the sale of a theatre in New York and $85 million from stock options exercises during the year, partially offset by higher acquisition activity in 2013. Total event related deferred revenue was 434 million as of the end of December compared to 364 million at the end of December 2012, an increase of 19%. The total capital expenditures for 2013 were 116 million with 59 million spent on maintenance items and 57 million on revenue generating additions, including our Ticketing re-platforming project. We currently project that our capital expenditures for 2014 will be $130 million as we expect overall CapEx to be roughly consistent as a percentage of revenue. Our total debt was 1.8 billion as of December 31st, and our weighted average cost of debt is 4.3%. This compares to our cost of debt in 2012 of 5.2% with the improvement coming from the debt refinancing we completed this year. Our single debt covenant currently requires a maximum leverage of 5.25 times and we are in compliance at less than 3.5 times. We are delighted with our strong results across all of our business segments and key financial metrics in 2013. Thank you for joining us today for the overview of these record results. And we will now open up the call for questions, operator?
Question:
and:
Operator: The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) In order to accommodate everyone, we request that you ask only one question with one follow-up if needed. (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee.
Vasily Karasyov : Thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk in more detail about the growth in sponsorship and advertising segment. Can you, it seems like that you highlighted that increase in festivals was a driver this year. How much does the guidance depend on increasing number of festivals and if you could just highlight the driver’s price versus new contracts would be great? Thank you.
 Sterne Agee: Thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk in more detail about the growth in sponsorship and advertising segment. Can you, it seems like that you highlighted that increase in festivals was a driver this year. How much does the guidance depend on increasing number of festivals and if you could just highlight the driver’s price versus new contracts would be great? Thank you.
Michael Rapino: Yes. I mean overall we look at our sponsorship in two categories as the onsite business where you are selling sponsorship whether it’s locally, regionally or nationally across your portfolio across the globe. We’ve shown that has been growing year-over-year for the last three years at 10% plus. We think we still have a lot of the runway on a global basis on the onsite business one, because we continually are just growing our fan base so when we grow 10% and 15% across your fan base you have more fans to sell sponsorship to and we also believe that we still have underutilized assets and believe for the next few years we see no reason why traditional onsite sponsorship will continue to grow at double-digits whether we’re upgrading low level sponsors to higher deals, finding new categories or selling across a broader portfolio. And the second piece of this has been the real growth engine behind our overall advertising business is the digital which as we said grew over 26% and we’re just at the start of that runway. We have no mobile advertising right now but with over 900 million visits to our platform we think we’re making great strides, but believe that’s again a double-digit plus-plus growth business for us for the next few years. So we think both of them have lots of inventory unsold, lots of portfolio opportunities to grow at double-digits.
Vasily Karasyov : Thank you. And just sponsorship contracts or relationships how long-term are they would it be fair to say that it’s a multiyear usually relationship?
 Sterne Agee: Thank you. And just sponsorship contracts or relationships how long-term are they would it be fair to say that it’s a multiyear usually relationship?
Michael Rapino: Yes, we have it’s very, and we have a lot of local deals, a lot of regional, a lots of national deals the larger the deal those tend to be a three to five year deal. The smaller deals are kind of maybe year-by-year or two years that is easily replaced. So three to five is kind of the number on the deals that matter on the top-end and historically we’ve had a very high renewal rate across our 750 sponsors.
Vasily Karasyov : Alright, thank you very much.
 Sterne Agee: Alright, thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from John Tinker with Maxim.
John Tinker : Thank you. The 12% increase in tickets for this year to-date, how much you think that is being driven by just that cyclical upturn and how much of it is by the fact that you’re just getting to people more effectively?
 Maxim Group: Thank you. The 12% increase in tickets for this year to-date, how much you think that is being driven by just that cyclical upturn and how much of it is by the fact that you’re just getting to people more effectively?
Michael Rapino: We think it’s related to your marketing story. We’re happy our marketing is effective. We do believe in general as we’ve been saying over the last two years that this industry has been a fairly unsophisticated marketing industry in general, print ads and radio spots in a market like Los Angeles don’t tend to be sharpen up to reach the real fan. So I think over the last two years as we’ve used our data and kind of been able to analytically go from basically zero to almost 40%-50% of our budgets now are being spent in some direct marketing social online direction. We think we’ve been able to find a much more effective means to target those consumers and we think it is a big reason that has been driving our per show attendance increase. So we think we have a long runway ahead as we get better and better at our digital ad server and buying across our platform and finding that exact U2 fan and sending in that message early versus the traditional shotgun approach of the past. So we think it’s a big factor we’ve outlined for the last couple of years social media database, mobile connected world and we can find those consumers, thanks to our huge database to purchase intents and purchase history will drive more effective marketing.
John Tinker : And so I am thinking to have a quick follow-up, your Ticketing AOI the margin is kicking up. How much of this is sort of Ticketmaster plus beginning to gain traction or is it just sort of near the end of the capital expenditure cycle?
 Maxim Group: And so I am thinking to have a quick follow-up, your Ticketing AOI the margin is kicking up. How much of this is sort of Ticketmaster plus beginning to gain traction or is it just sort of near the end of the capital expenditure cycle?
Kathy Willard: John, year-over-year it’s really pretty flat.
John Tinker : I’m looking at the quarter.
 Maxim Group: I’m looking at the quarter.
Kathy Willard: The quarters are always going to live around a bit. So I wouldn’t look too much at that. I think I'd look at the full year and we feel it’s pretty consistent year-over-year.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question David Joyce with ISI Group.
David Joyce - ISI Group: I was wondering which venues tend to be leading and lagging so far in the ticket sales as well as in the concert sales?
Michael Rapino: As we stated in our Q3 and now in our Q4, in 2013 every segment of venues portfolio performed exceptionally well, whether it was small theaters and clubs who had more shows, more young artists, whether it was arenas or amphitheaters or this year even stadiums, which look to be robust again in 2014. And obviously festivals have been on a growth chair on a global basis. So the goodness is from top to bottom activity, more bands, more consumers showing up to the venue has kind of been growth consistent in both international and North America markets.
David Joyce - ISI Group: And on the Ticketmaster side, how much of the client contracts will be coming up this year for renegotiation? And how far along are you in giving secondary ticketing on those clients?
Michael Rapino: In 2014, there is no exceptional renewals this year but we don’t expect the renewal would be at risk, typical year renewal cycle, long-term deals on most of those contracts. So none of them are up at any specific point they'd kind of cycle through year-over-year. As far as the TM resale question, I wasn’t sure, you asked exactly what - when did we get how many clients on did you ask?
David Joyce - ISI Group: Yes, just how far along are you in getting your secondary ticketing rolled out?
Michael Rapino: We did roll it out. Last August we launched the TM resale business. As we said today, we had over 1000 concerts in the last four or five months on the TM resale page, that Ticketmaster. And we had three quarters of the -- NBA, NHL, and NFL teams were all official partners with Ticketmaster resale on through the entire season. So we’ve made great progress in selling throughout all the portfolios of sports and concerts and I’m looking through getting most of our clients to adopt and activate the product.
David Joyce - ISI Group: Sorry, I asked you to repeat a little bit of that. I lost you there a minute. And just finally on the O2, is that closed? Is there anything that we should expect on that this year versus last year? Any new opportunities?
Michael Rapino: In Ireland?
David Joyce - ISI Group: Yes.
Michael Rapino: Now just we’ve always been in that business. It's a leader in Dublin Ireland. Our margin business for us, we were a partner but had some financial issues. So we took over the remaining equity in the venue to ensure and solidify our position in Dublin.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie: I have two questions. First on the international segment; can you just frame for us, better frame for us, kind of the number of concerts or tickets or specific markets or genres that you’re going after for this year and next year? And then my second question is on expenses. Kathy can you just talk about some of the tailwinds or headwinds that we can actually see, particularly as you cycle through some of the investments over at Ticketmaster? Thanks.
Michael Rapino: Hello, Amy. On the international, are you looking - our metric showed the breakout. You’re looking in 2014, are you asking is there any -- where we’ll spend more time on or what’s the specific question on the international show count/ metric?
Amy Yong - Macquarie: Sure. I guess over the next two to three years, any particular regions, whether it be Asia or LATAM where we could see areas of investments that could lead to upside to numbers, whether or not it’s the number of concerts or tickets being sold? Anything like that would be very helpful?
Michael Rapino: I see. Yes, as you look at the way we -- if you look at history and how expanded many years ago, we were a very U.S. centric business and today in 33 countries we’re a global business. So our strategy tends to be, to open up a retail market, you need some scale in that region. So if you look originally in Europe you start in London or Holland and you try to figure out those nine or 10 markets in the area and that’s when the synergy and efficiency comes to life, because then you can buy a tour and you have all of the western Europe and the zone filled out. And you can drive you content through there, you can start employing sponsorship and ticketing. So Eastern and Western Europe are fairly filled out. Always some bolt-ons we'll look for to keep that market strong. And where we’ve been focusing the last year is you’ve seen us slowly one-by-one -- ad markets in the Pacific Rim and Asia to start filling out that zone. You obviously let everyone else know that there is a lot of young demographics in Asia dying to see Rihanna. So we’ve been expanding over those markets. You will continue to see us over the next two to three years add full time offices in Asia. We’ve already been in China for years. We’ve been in South Korea and Hong Kong. We recently looked at Thailand and et cetera, So you’ll build on our Asian Pacific rim. When that becomes a real zone we can synergize our tours, sponsorship and then ticketing. And you’ll see us continue looking at Latin America. Like most of the world we were a excited a couple of years ago; have stepped back to find the right partner and the right economics down there. But you’ll see continue to look as our deal [indiscernible] 30:32 comes up over the next year you'll look for us -- we’ll look to start establishing some permanent offices in South America. And again the reason we need permanent offices is we have the global content. When we sell off global content but partnered with a local partner, it's the least effective margin for us. If we have a local office, we’ll capture in all the local benefits of bringing that U2 short of the market and from there let’s just go about our sponsorship, ticketing and onsite revenue. So Asia is where you’ll see us continue over the short term and we’ll be opportunistic in South America as certain markets and opportunities come together. In the interim you’ll see us just continuing with bolt on strategy in North America and Eastern and Western Europe where needed to supplement our core.
Kathy Willard:  And maybe on the cost structure question, it’s one of the pillars of our three year plan that we’ve laid out and it’s coming from the -- primarily the north American tickets in 2015 and that’s what we talked about, the $0.35 a ticket on those, as we roll out the new product and start to be able to take cost out of the system.
Operator:  And we’ll take our next question from Richard Tullo with Albert Fried.
Richard Tullo - Albert, Fried:  As we look at 2014, normally I would say, wow, this is going to be a huge year with U2 going to UGF, but it seems to me that Live Nation is really going to benefit from the organic opportunities and part of that I think is the conversion of ticket sales in the back of the house into AOI growth. Could you explain to us the benefit of the performance in 2013; was it really due to extensions on to previously existing tours or it's filling up the back half of the house?
Michael Rapino:  Yes is the answer to all of that. We have a few things going on. We’ve been building this model for a while. So it’s all about monetizing the ecosystem. There’s never one tour that makes a difference. It’s about the scale of our business. So having the largest sponsorship team and being able to continually sell against your portfolio is a big growth curve for us. Ticketmaster and launching a secondary offering and starting to really monetize some of the revenue, as we also look to re-launch and expand our bigger platform later is key to growth. We look at the concert business, going to my earlier reference, having the scale we have has also given us the luxury of having one of the greatest marketing teams and databases, which starts to make a difference when we’re selling these shows. So we do believe that we have a robust consumer base that wants to go to the show. We have an invigorated supply chain of artists coming up, filling up venues. We look at artists like Lourde and mainly new artists; a year ago we weren’t talking about but will go on and do great things this year. It’s an incredible supply of great young artists that need to get on the road. We got consumer demand and the supply. Our job is then to make sure we fill that extra thousand or two thousand tickets per show to maximize our bottom line. We saw success in that in ’13. We think in ’14 we got two great things happening. To be sitting here today, saying that we are ahead of what was a record attendance is good news. That means that the supply is out there. That means consumers are buying and it means that we’re continually grabbing more market share from our competitors. So we think we’re going to have to a ticket and show count this year that will drive year-over-year growth but every year we’re getting better and better at monetizing that per show profitability by selling a few extra tickets more effectively, by driving onsite profitability, selling more sponsorship and driving extra seats when we sell incremental tickets. So we think we’re executing on all cylinders and we have in ’14 that would appear to be some decent tailwind from a consumer spend and an artist supply.
Richard Tullo - Albert, Fried: 
 :
Michael Rapino:  Well I’ll talk about the data question. As everyone knows the buzz is always about data. We happen to have probably one of the largest data bases of live consumers in the world. We've gotten better over the last couple of years at accumulating that data, getting it segmented and usable for our business operators and over the last year we felt it will come to life by using that data to be area effective at direct marketing, which is the sweet spot for driving lower costs and higher per show tickets. So we think the data is -- like everyone talks about one of our unique gold mines. We’re getting better at it every day on monetizing that data by being a lot more effective direct marketers. The example would be last year we would have looked at our data and said who went to and bought mega tickets for country? This year we can go out and very early, talk specifically to all of those consumers, who may have purchased exactly that package historically and start to use our effective marketing dollars at a very sharp shooting approach to talk to cast purchases and casual consumers who we know have a high likelihood to purchase, which takes all the efficiency into the marketplace, that historically we were shooting way wide in our marketing approach. So that is going to enable us to be way more efficient with our $200 million and drive per-sales ticket sales per show by motivating that consumer directly. Kathy?
Kathy Willard:  As far as AOI as a percentage of free cash flow, obviously we have shown some growth and if you take out, if you really look at year-over-year ‘13 to ‘12 and take out those tax refunds we received last year, we’re actually up a bit this year. So we’re seeing a good growth come in already. Going through the pieces, obviously AOI, we've given you some information in terms of a three year plan and whatever you are presuming is going to happen in ‘14 for AOI, cash interest expense will be down again because we put the -- we did a new refinancing in August, and we haven’t seen the full year impact of that yet. And those are probably the biggest pieces that would be changing it but I think overall it’s a scale business as we continue to grow that. Then we expect to continue to deliver positive trends there.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Ben Mogil with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Ben Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus:  So just wanted to talk about secondary a little bit here. Michael I think in the last quarter you talked about sort of 750,000 tickets being sold on the secondary platform in the third quarter. Can you give us a sense of what the number looked like in the fourth quarter?
Michael Rapino: I don’t know if I said that number in the third quarter. We can say it certainly has been continued on a rapid growth trajectory. I'm not sure that we have given out considerate numbers.
Ben Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus: Then maybe…
Michael Rapino: We don’t think we have broken that out to that granular.
Ben Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus: And then looking at the secondary markets; so at the beginning of February Stubhub went back to its resellers and offered them both higher volume discounts and also lowered the threshold above which you started to get some discounting. When you look at what they are doing and that’s almost more B2B, because I think the threshold was like $0.5 million with the ticket sales. When you look at that sort of part of the business and you look at what you’re doing; should we be thinking about you guys as more -- I bought a ticket for a show, I can’t go, I want to resell it, as opposed to Stubhub, which seems to be more focused on the volume i.e. sort of ticket broker side of the business. Is that the right way we should be thinking about the dynamics in the market?
Michael Rapino: No not at all. The marketplace is a supply and demand business. Most of the tickets did end up on secondary sites, large component are the professional brokers in all those markets. We have a great relationship with them and have similar incentive programs with them. So they are a large supplier to secondary websites. We continue to work with them. And we also see us having a large relationship with the NFL, NBA, NHL and the content. So we’re unlike their Stubhub, very aligned with the content and you can see that through the NFL Exchange. And of course the component of the consumer that can’t go, the consumer that wants to sell his tickets for profit, that’s a component of the business and big part of Ticketmaster also. So we’re in the same business. Our only competitive advantage that we look at from differently than Stubhub is we're in the primary business with a lot of traffic and we know that when 27 million uniques are coming into that website, that having three months of no Beyoncé tickets didn’t make a lot of sense and the 1001 [ph] for the next three months having Beyoncé tickets available for fans adds a big level of inventory to the store shelf. And we have seen the growth. To date we expect that to continue to grow as we work with the colleagues and the brokers and others to supply the inventory on-site.
Operator:  And we will take our next question from Doug Arthur with Evercore.
Doug Arthur - Evercore:  Joe, you talked a little bit about the moving parts at artist nation. That had awfully good quarter on a down revenue number and I know there is a lot of shifting parts there. But have you sort of lowered the cost structure of that now on an ongoing basis? That’s question one.
Joe Berchtold: Yes, I think that we lowered the cost structure over the beginning of the year and part of this is; I think we're seeing the results of the greater alignment with the concert business and part of this is timing. That helps in the fourth quarter for sure. But as I also say, it wasn’t just a fourth quarter on that part of the business. It was the total second half that saw both strong revenue increase as well as an improvement in profitability. So we feel good about where the business is at this point. We think it’s prime to continue to grow and add more, both in its own right as well as what it contributes to the rest of the business.
Doug Arthur - Evercore:  Okay, great. And then Michael, this maybe a mix issue but if I look at ancillary revenues per attendee, you have had really good growth in the festival business overseas but the amps have been kind of flattish. I know historically that’s been a goal to get that up. Is there any kind of trend there or is that a mix issue?
Michael Rapino:  It tends to be a mix issue. We have been fairly efficient with the North American amps on-site business. So we obviously like to see it grow year-over-year. We don’t have high expectations. But there is a ton of room left in that business from an F&B perspective, as I said operating fairly efficiently but it is a mix. One of the realties are when you have Kid Rock dates, lots of beers sold and then when you have One Direction, a few bottles of water have sold. So, depending on the mix you may have that year, it can vary by a $1 up or down but generally we think the business, because of its country base in ‘14, will be able to deliver those numbers or better looking at the mix this year. 
Doug Arthur - Evercore:  Great. And actually just one follow-up. You had very good success in the online ad sales, up 26% but the theme is that you are just scratching the surface, particularly in mobile. Would it be your hope that or expectation that, that you continue to see 20% plus growth in there for some time?
Michael Rapino:  Well you're not going to get me on that exact number but I would say, yes, I think we all look at the industry of digital, online and mobile growth as growing, highest of all advertising mediums. We think we've done a fabulous job. Where three years ago we weren’t even in this business, we've stepped up over the last three years a strong digital team, align that with our digital content. We've been able to grow that business substantially. We think yes it’s going to be a double-digit plus growth business for us, as we can get better at delivering ad units online, digital, mobile et cetera.
Operator:  And we will take our final question today from Martin Pyykkonen with Wedge Partners.
Martin Pyykkonen - Wedge Partners:  Two questions. I guess on the AOI margin for the concert segment going forward in the year, I know you are not going to give a number in terms of guidance, but can you talk about what the swing factors might be in 2013 in terms of attendance and revenue and AOI was up in dollars, incrementally, up in terms of margin. Where could that go or what are the sort of fundamental limits to it, if you want to talk about in that way? And then second question on social media, when I look at your sales and marketing for 2013, up just over 7%, obviously revenue for the company and concerts into high double-digits. Was there -- in 2013 and should we pick a discount in this year where you are pulling back maybe to sort of "traditional media" advertising spend and getting a leverage out of social media? Is that what’s kind of going on within the sales and marketing numbers in percent of revenue? Thanks.
Michael Rapino:  So, on the first one first, let me start with the constraints on the profitability, the concert business. Your typical deal with an artist business is they might get 80% to 90% of the door and then you've got cost to cover on top of that, it is going to be a low limited margin business inherently. So we have said that I think in the past talked about, that’s why the importance of getting that concert. The power of the flywheel then drives the on-site sponsorship, the ticketing businesses, to drive the majority of the profitability. I think in 2013 you saw a nice increase in the relative profitability of that business, largely because you had strong increases in attendance per show. So even though if you think about the artisans being a substantially variable cost against the revenue stream, lot of your other costs associated with putting on the show from the marketing to the actual night of the show are going to be more fixed against the given show, which then means more people you can drive to that show, the greater it is your profitability, the greater it is your profit margin. So do we really think there is still room for us to continue to hedge up in our profitability of the business? Yes, but it’s never going to be a high margin business. It’s never going to be something where you see a dramatic increase as we think that having a -- I broke out a lot of the specific numbers -- having very high increases in attendance per show; we saw how is I’ve listed. You can get range in terms of where that can go. In terms of the second question on our advertising shift and its impact, absolutely big focus in 2013. You can see the focus in 2014 is shifting ad spend away from traditional media to social and digital platforms. And we think that was one of the factors that helps our attendance per show and we think that there's still ways to go in what we can do there is as well as the upside of the effectiveness of doing so. It comes, a piece at a time, or two at a time, but it's certainly the trend that exists for our business.
Martin Pyykkonen - Wedge Partners: Okay and then just quickly if I can do a follow-up on the festival business in particular and that to the extent you can split this up domestic versus foreign, is there -- should we be thinking there's a lot of run way and headwind in terms of adding trustable volume in terms of shows or festivals that would make sense to you financially or is there any diminishing returns, large number sort of impact that is closer or is there a headroom still go?
Michael Rapino : Well, we look at everything on a global basis. So as large as we are, we still look at the globe and have lots of runway in all of the categories, with lots of runway to expand, Ticketmaster into foreign markets. We haven’t been very aggressive at it, lots of room to move Live Nation into more markets that are growing. And in our portfolio we’re very strong on European basis, have 40 or 50 festivals in Europe, and have a smaller portfolio in North America. And then when you look at Latin America, Pacific Rim et cetera. We would have no festivals there. So we’re into festival business, a big segment, market growth and we still believe we have a relatively small overall market share on a global basis. I think we have lots of room to still build those into our portfolio when growing that business.
Operator: And there are no further questions. I’ll turn the call back over to Mr. Rapino for closing remarks.
Michael Rapino : Great. Thank you, everybody, and we'll talk to you all in Q1.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. We had the best quarter in the company's history with record-setting revenue, AOI and free cash flow. This has been the best 9 months of revenue and AOI ever for the company. In addition to the strong financial results, over the past quarter, we have continued making progress on all our strategic growth drivers. Our core business model remains unchanged. The Concerts platform is the flywheel of our company, and as we continue to grow attendance, that directly feed the high-margin on-site sponsorship and Ticketing businesses. In each of these businesses, we are generating increasing returns to scale and have now established the largest global platform in all businesses and are best positioned to maximize return from each fan. And we've been extremely successful this year in attracting more fans to our shows with 45 million people attending concerts in the first 9 months of the year, a 17% increase from 2012. We are building share, taking it from competitors and expanding the global pie and as we have been equally strong in both U.S. and international with growth this year. Success has been consistent with increased attendance per show across our amphitheaters and arenas, festivals, theaters and clubs. We've had great success in growing new artists to established artists and all in between with 7 of our top 10 tours led by young artists. And all genres and music grew led by country music, which has grown 47% through the first 9 months of the year. Our second strategic focus is continuing to deliver double-digit AOI growth in our high-margin sponsorship platform. As we are seeing increased attraction to our live events as a means for brands to cut the clutter and reach target audiences. With our scale across all music segments, we have the ability to deliver over 45 million 18- to 54-year-old fans with our mainstream brands targeting mass audience. We're also able to reach 20 million 18 to 34 year olds with brands looking to reach that specific generation live target. In addition, in North America via Ticketmaster, we reached 40 million 18 to 34 year olds and 85 million 18 to 54 year olds, providing even greater reach for our advertisers. The first priority is Ticketmaster's focus on deploying new products. Our key product launch this quarter was Ticketmaster resale transparently presenting fans with all options, both primary and secondary together, on both our online and mobile platforms. Since this launch, we have activated 50 teams from the NFL, NBA and NHL and over 100 concerts with more than 1,400 total events and sold over 750,000 tickets for these events. The early feedback reinforces the value proposition to fans. And what we are seeing so far is that when fans see both primary and secondary tickets together, they are 60% more likely to buy a ticket of some sort and 10% more likely to buy a primary ticket as compared to just seeing primary ticket options. So we are seeing not just price comparison across secondary tickets but increased transparency on high-priced secondary tickets is driving increased conversion on our primary tickets. We will be in beta through the end of the year, as we continue to roll out adoption across all our clients and implement all the insights from our AB testing. At this point, we have enough visibility to be confident that for the full year, we will deliver planned growth in revenue, AOI, free cash flow and leverage free cash flow per share. With that, I will turn it over to Joe Berchtold, our COO, to take you through more detailed divisional performance.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. First, Concerts, Live Nation Concerts revenue for the third quarter was up 21%, and AOI improved by 44% versus 2012. This third quarter performance was driven by a 27% increase in global attendance, growing by nearly 4.5 million fans to over 21 million for the quarter. As part of this, we've had a record 19 artists already play to more than 500,000 fans led by P!nk, Rihanna, Maroon 5, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan. Looking at our Concerts business by market. First, the international markets increased attendance by 25% in the third quarter. Of this, 1.3 million growth in fans, the greatest driver was our arena business, which added 900,000 fans through a 49% increase in show count and a 28% increase in per-show attendance. The other main growth driver was our 26 festivals, which added 500,000 fans. In North America, attendance was up 27% or 3.2 million fans for the quarter led by amphitheaters with over 2 million more fans from 100 more shows and an 18% increase in per-show attendance. Attendance was also up at festivals, arenas and stadiums for the quarter, all of which saw increased show count and attendance per show to drive another 1 million fans to these shows. More broadly, we've continued to execute on our global priority of building our festival portfolio, investing to launch 16 new festivals and buying festival platforms with brands we believe can be extended on both a regional and global basis. Year-to-date, we've had over 4 million fans attend 61 festivals and expect to end the year with over 20% attendance growth of 69 festivals across 15 countries with 26 of these festivals new from last year. We have also made good progress on our other global priority building out the EDM segmental. Investing in this space, we are increasing the number of EDM festivals this year to 18 from 10 last year. And we expect to roughly double attendance over 2.5 million fans this year with about half of those fans coming to our festivals and the others attending arena, theater and club shows. We're clearly setting up to have a record attendance this year. Our attendance through the third quarter plus sales for fourth quarter shows to date totals over 53 million tickets, up about 10 million tickets from the same point in 2012. While this will decelerate some in the fourth quarter, we currently expect attendance growth of roughly 15% for the year and as a result, roughly doubling our Concerts segment AOI. Now turning to Sponsorship & Advertising business. For the third quarter, revenue was up 15%, and AOI was up 12%. Growth in the division has been consistent throughout the year, and this quarter has continued its double-digit AOI growth. Our greatest growth in the quarter continues to be online advertising, which grew revenue almost 40%. This growth has been led by our relaunch of livenation.com, which provides a more engaging site for our fans and generates higher CPM rates with substantially more rich content throughout the site. As the result, the site has increased total page views by 25% so far this year. And we see this trend towards richer content and associated higher CPMs continuing on the site, as our content increased higher-value programs such as the Ford Rider webisode series and the content for Jeep's 30 Miles of Freedom campaign. And with our Sponsorship & Advertising business now more than 90% sold for the business, we expect to be on plan with low double-digit AOI growth for the division this year. Next, Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster had a 4% increase in global ticket sales in the third quarter led by double-digit growth in the sports segment and over 1 million additional concert tickets sold. As a result, Ticketing revenue was up 3%, though AOI was down 2% on a comparable basis, largely because of the Olympics business last year. Our largest initiative remains rebuilding our Ticketing platform, and our approach is heavily focused on enabling new features and releasing products along with the development cycle, which has been ongoing with our venue customers throughout this year, including reporting on inventory management products now adopted by over 65% and 20% of our U.S. customers, respectively. And now we're using the technology on the consumer side as well with the integrated inventory of product being the first to use the platform's commerce engine and APIs. And on a broader level, we continue to be on plan to start converting our amphitheaters to the full product late next year. Last quarter, I indicated that as we continue rebuilding our technology platform at Ticketmaster, we're focused on 3 priorities this year: first, maintaining and extending our market leadership position and through the first 9 months, we've continued to deliver a net renewal rate of over 100% globally for the business; second, growing our secondary business and deploying our Ticketmaster integrated inventory product, as Michael gave you an update on how that's progressing; and finally, we're focused on improving and expanding ticket buying and management on mobile devices. This quarter, we have again doubled the share of tickets via mobile in North America relative to last year with mobile accounting for 12% of overall ticket sales and 14% of concert ticket sales. With the new apps that we have in the pipeline for later this year, making it even easier to buy, transfer, sell and manage tickets, we expect this rapid shift by fans to mobile platforms to continue. And with these initiatives well in hand for the full year, we expect both Ticketmaster AOI and primary ticket volume to be roughly flat. Finally, Artist Nation. Here, we believe that we have taken the steps necessary to position the division for more stable performance and long-term growth. At this point, we have all the core managers signed for long-term deals, and have also seen that as we provide our managers and their artists with greater value from our Concerts, sponsorship and Ticketing businesses, we are naturally seeing an increase our share of touring business with these managers. We've also streamlined the division, keeping it focused on the high-margin Artist Management business while moving some of the ancillary activities into the Concert division where they more naturally belong. And with this restructuring now complete, we expect to start seeing growth in the business, and we will be adding select managers whom we think will not only help build this division but will feed directly into the success of our Concerts, sponsorship and Ticketing businesses. And based on this, I think going forward, we'll start to see improvement on a comparables basis for this division. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy Willard to take you through more details on the financials.
Kathy Willard: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide highlights on our earnings and then more details on the balance sheet and cash flow for the third quarter and year-to-date. First, for the third quarter. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up 15% over the same period in 2012, driven by Concerts growth of 21% and Sponsorship & Advertising's increase of 15%. Adjusted operating income for the quarter grew 9% to $221 million as compared to $202 million in 2012 with Concerts up 44% and Sponsorship & Advertising higher by 12%. Operating income for the third quarter was $126 million compared to $105 million last year. This improvement came from our higher AOI, along with a $9 million additional gain on disposal of assets primarily related to the theater sale in May. Net income for the quarter was $44 million compared to $58 million in 2012. Net income for the period with the $80 million given our improved operating income and reduced interest expense, but we recorded debt extinguishment costs of $36 million in the quarter from our debt refinancing. Revenue for the 9 months was $4.9 billion, up 11% over the same period in 2012. The majority of this growth was in Concerts, up 16%, and Sponsorship & Advertising was higher by 15% year-to-date. Adjusted operating income for the 9 months grew 9% to $434 million as compared to $397 million last year. Concerts AOI is up 66% in the first 9 months from the strength in North America amphitheater shows and international arena and stadium shows. Sponsorship & Advertising's AOI grew 12% from increased online advertising and higher festival and other sponsorship activity globally. For the first 9 months of 2013, our overall AOI margin was 9%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income for the 9 months was $191 million compared to $105 million last year from our higher AOI and the $43 million gain on disposal of assets in our Concerts segment. Net income for the 9 months was $39 million compared to a net loss of $4 million in 2012, driven by our higher AOI. Free cash flow was $167 million in the third quarter compared to $152 million last year with the improvement in AOI. And for the 9 months this year, free cash flow was $283 million compared to $274 million in 2012, an increase over last year due to higher AOI and lower cash interest even with the impact of the tax refund received in 2012. Cash flow from operations was $265 million for the 9 months as compared to $89 million last year with the increase driven by our higher AOI along with the $131 million improvement in working capital. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.3 billion, which includes $510 million in ticketing client cash. After deducting event-related cash for future shows, our free cash was $539 million. Free cash was up due to the sale of the New York theater and proceeds from stock option exercises during the year totaling approximately $140 million. Total event-related deferred revenue was $313 million as of the end of September compared to $273 million in September of last year. The total capital expenditures for 2013 through the third quarter were $80 million with $38 million on maintenance items and $42 million on revenue-generating additions, including our Ticketing re-platforming project. We continue to expect that our total capital expenditures for 2013 will be approximately $120 million. During the quarter, we refinanced our senior secured credit facility and added $200 million to our 7% notes to pay off our $250 million 8 1/8 notes. As a result, our cash interest cost will be reduced by approximately $12 million annually. We also reduced our covenants on the credit facility to a single leverage test currently set at 5.25x and stepping down over time. As of September 30, we are in compliance at under 3.5x. Our total debt was $1.8 billion as of September 30, and our weighted average cost of good is 4.3%. During the quarter, we reclassified our convertible notes of $209 million net of discounts to current on the balance sheet since they are putable by the holders on July 2014. As Michael mentioned, we've had record results across our key financial metrics and expect to finish the year with solid growth. In summary, our expectations for the full year are: Given the strength of the summer concert season, we expect Concerts AOI this year to be roughly double 2012 with margin improvement. We continue to expect Sponsorship & Advertising to deliver low double-digit AOI growth with margin slightly down due to higher custom programs in the year. Ticketing's AOI and margins are expected to be essentially flat compared to last year given investments in our Ticketing platform and the 2012 Olympics activity last year. Based on these divisional results, we expect to deliver high single-digit growth in both revenue and AOI for the full company. And we continue to expect free cash flow as a percentage of AOI to be roughly in line with last year despite the cash tax refunds received in 2012 in line with our planned growth through 2015. Thank you for joining us today for the overview of our great third quarter results. We will now open up the call for questions, operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Doug Arthur with Evercore.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Yes, I guess, this is a question for Michael or Joe. Last year, in the big third quarter, the Concerts segment had very strong revenues but less strong AOI results, which I think were actually down last year. So this year, you got the leverage in the models, so what changed? What are the key things that changed? I know, obviously, getting margins up in the Concerts segment has been a big focus, but what was the key difference?
Michael Rapino: Thanks, Doug. One of the successes we had this year is, one, it was spread globally. So last year, remember, we had a strong U.S., but Europe was still struggling. So this year, having both Europe and America firing all cylinders is a big piece of why the total pie has grown. And number two is we were very successful this year in our marketing and social marketing, et cetera, to drive per-show attendance. And then you know, in this business, every ticket you sell with that current fixed basis, profit goes up. So having a higher per-show attendance is going to drive your profitability, and having Europe come back strong this year was the second piece on why the total pie is bigger this year.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Great. And just as a follow-up, I mean, the Insomnia acquisition was -- well, I mean, there's the -- the taking control of majority ownership was a significant revenue driver in the second quarter, was not necessary significant earnings driver. Was that more accretive in the third quarter? Or is that still a bit of a push in terms of bottom line impact?
Michael Rapino: Yes, it would be -- I mean, both revenue and AOI across our base would be a couple percentage points so not significant in any sense.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried Company.
Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division: I guess, my big question here is as we look at 2014, how does Live Nation benefit from any of the quadralenial events such as Olympics, World Cup? I would assume that, that would be on Ticketing, but would there be any giveback on events, especially in Brazil?
Michael Rapino: No, that wouldn't really affect our year next year. We're not active in Brazil or the Winter Olympics in Russia in any significant matter to take any business away from that, so it won't be a factor in any sense next year for us. It'll be business as usual across the globe for us and our 41 other markets.
Richard Tullo - Albert Fried & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And just a little quick one, 40% growth on the interactive ad sales, is that from a base of about -- what base are we talking about there? I mean, last I know was about $56 million.
Joe Berchtold: Rich, Joe. If you look, it's in the release, for the 3 months it's growing from $14.6 million to $20.1 million and over the 9 months, growing from $38 million to $49 million.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ben Mogil with Stifel.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to ask you a question on the sort of primary-secondary interplay. In terms of side of either gross dollars or sort of gross contribution in just dollars, forget about margin, if you sell a ticket on the secondary market, it's kind of roughly the same as the primary market ticket pricing. Are your gross contribution about the same? Do you make more money on a primary or secondary? I'm sort of looking at it after all the fees, the various rights holders are sort of calculated.
Michael Rapino: Well, 2 things to look at. One, the secondary is incremental. So today, that's a new dollar is a new dollar. And from my notes that I've just kind of just referenced earlier, the only concern you'll have is are you trading secondary dollars with primary dollars and is there an economic downfall for either of that. The good news to date is we're actually seeing increased primary conversion, which intuitively makes sense. Everywhere you shop, the more price comparisons you get. The better-priced product will do better. So we're seeing an increase in primary. But regardless of that transaction, a secondary or a primary is basically the same margin. Secondary is generally a much higher fee or slash revenue.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And I guess, that's just because you're assuming that the secondary price are, generally speaking, above the face value of the primary. Is that correct in that view?
Michael Rapino: Yes, given most of our clients and the way we operate have floors, we're not selling secondaries below primary for face. So obviously, the majority, high majority of a secondary sell is a above face, which means the fee's higher.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: With your evidence sort of showing the primary is, in fact, aided by this integration, are you seeing the leagues somewhat more open now to sort of letting those floors go? Or is it still too early to make that sort of announcement?
Michael Rapino: Yes, we don't see that as a big hurdle right now. We think that, at the end of the day, the great secondary business, generally, is driven by the hot teams, the hot concerts and the good seats. That's where the money is. If you're getting into selling the upper deck at a baseball game for $3, you're not doing it for margin, you're just doing it for attendance. So for our business, we'll be happy to participate in the strong sales, good seats and let the brands protect their price integrity on the floor.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. [Operator Instructions]
Michael Rapino: All right. Thank you, everybody.
Operator: All right. And there's no further questions in the queue. And actually, we do have one additional speak or one additional question, John Tinker with Maxim.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Technological problems at this end. You mentioned -- you've gone through some of the numbers on the different genres and pointed out how strong country music is. As you look at your portfolio, if you look at country in EDM, what is a way of thinking what the right share of these businesses should be?
Operator: Mr. Rapino, we're not hearing you at this moment. Can you pick up? And ladies and gentlemen, I believe our speaker may have disconnected.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Okay, next time.
Operator: All right. We're going to go ahead and close up the conference call. Sorry about that, Mr. Tinker. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. We had great results for our second quarter with all our core businesses performing well, setting us up for what looks to be a record summer. Starting with the top line, our revenue was up 8% for the quarter, driven by growth in our Concert position. Looking broadly at consumer demand for Concerts, we have seen double-digit growth in concerts at both Live Nation and Ticketmaster on a global basis, reconfirming the quality of live artist on the supply side and strong fan desire to attend live shows as a top entertainment option. At the same time, we continue to build share, with ticket sales for our Concerts up 26% through June. We're also continuing to drive AOI growth at even faster rates than revenue. AOI was up 10% in the quarter, and free cash flow also up for the quarter, along with higher free cash on our balance sheet. As I did last quarter, let me give you an update on the 5 strategic drivers that we believe will deliver our 2015 AOI and cash targets. First, growing market share in concerts and tickets up by 5 million tickets. If you can tell from my opening comments, this is shaping up to be our strongest concert season ever. We've already sold 2 million more fans at our shows this summer than last year at this time, with double-digit growth expected for this year across festivals, amphitheaters and arenas. We're seeing this growth from both the artist and fan side, with show count growth from clubs, amphitheaters and arenas, while also increasing the attendance per show at all of our venues. As a result, I expect us to achieve our 5 million incremental fans by 2014. In addition to this organic growth, we also continue to look for strategic acquisitions and partnerships that could expand our platform. In this quarter, we closed on Insomniac, the world's largest electronic dance company and expanded into Hong Kong and Singapore, key markets for our Asian footprint. Our second priority is to increase event awareness and ticket conversion, driven by shifting and tripling spend in social and digital channels by 2015 to over 35% of our ad budget. In the first half of this year, we've increased our attendance per show across arenas, stadiums and amphitheaters. And I believe these shows are benefiting as we shift from spending on broad media to increasing our spent on artist-specific social channels, targeted data-driven direct marketing. For 2013, we have increased the spend to 25% of our total ad spend and are on path to our 35% goal. Third, deliver double-digit growth in our Sponsorship & Advertising business. This business continues to deliver consistent double-digit growth, fueled by the overall growth of our Concert platform, continued strong double-digit growth of our online advertising units and additional global strategic sponsors who are attracted to the scale and scope of our global platform. Fourth, we are triple market share in our secondary business. As I have discussed in the past, we see secondary ticketing as one of our greatest growth opportunities. There's a $4 billion market in the U.S. alone, and we have a very low market share. We are highly confident that bringing primary and secondary together on one secure, transparent platform, done in collaboration with content owners and venues, we can build a product which will create great value for fans. We launched TicketMaster-Plus in beta a few weeks back with a handful of shows and plan on spending much of the remainder of this year working with teams, venues and content owners to drive adoption. As a result, we expect to continue building share in secondary through this year and then accelerate our share growth in 2014 as TM-Plus is fully in place. And finally, we'll reduce ticketing cost by $0.35 per ticket in North America through our re-platform project. While the immediate focus is on delivering better products at Ticketmaster for both fans and venue partners, we remain confident that our cost reductions will be delivered in 2015 as planned. So in summary, our strong performance in the first quarter continued and accelerated across all our core businesses in the second quarter. We have now seen enough concert ticket sales, sponsorship commitments and Ticketmaster sales to be confident that this revenue and AOI growth will continue in the second half of the year, and we will deliver the full 2013 in line with our 3-year plan. With that, I will turn it over to Joe Berchtold, our COO, to take you through an update on the divisional performance.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. First, Concerts. Live Nation Concerts revenue for the second quarter was up 11%, and AOI improved by 18% versus 2012. The second quarter performance was driven by an 8% increase in global attendance with a 4% increase in attendance per show. And as Michael noted, concert ticket sales for all shows this year is up 26% from this point last year, with 23 million tickets already sold for shows in the second half compared to 15 million at the end of June 2012, a 50% increase. Taking this by market. First, our international markets increased attendance by 23% in the second quarter. This was driven by strong stadium tours with Bruce Springsteen, Vasco Rossi and Depeche Mode across Europe in the quarter. And going into the second half, we expect continued solid attendance growth led by our arena business. This is highlighted by our P!nk tour in Australia with 42 shows for over 500,000 fans, along with Fleetwood Mac, Bruno Mars and Rihanna, all leading major international tours. In North America, attendance was flat for the quarter with strong growth in festivals offset by fewer arena and stadium shows. As we head into the third quarter though, we see very strong growth in both the amphitheater and arena businesses, with show count and attendance per show up. At this point, we have already had 9 artists sell over 500,000 tickets for arena and amp tours in 2013 led by Maroon 5, Beyoncé, Kid Rock, One Direction, Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean. As we've discussed, our other global priority is festivals. In this year, we expect to grow our festival base by over 20% to more than 4 million fans attending 67 festivals across 15 countries. We continue to see strength in our traditional rock and pop based festivals in Europe, new success with country festivals such as Faster Horses and Watershed in the U.S. and a growing base of EDM festivals. On the EDM side, we expect to more than double our attendance this year with over 2.5 million fans projected to attend our events. This growth comes as we hold 17 festivals across the U.S. and Europe, expanding our Hard and Cream brands and building on our Insomniac partnership. The other profit lever we continue to focus on is revenue optimization for our shows. This year, we expect almost every tour and festival to provide some form of platinum ticketing opportunity as we continue to extract greater value from those fans who want to pay for the premium experience, while at the same time, we're using value channels to make sure we're appropriately filling the house. In conjunction with these products, we also continued to deploy our pricing tools, both to make sure we effectively price at the on sale and also to dynamically adjust pricing along the way. So based on our first half performance, ticket volume already sold for the second half and the strength of our revenue optimization programs, we are now confident we will deliver double-digit growth in attendance at our concerts this year, which will drive substantial growth in Concerts AOI. Now turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. For the second quarter, revenue was up 16%, and AOI was up 10%. Our performance was delivered by a combination of continued double-digit growth in our North America online advertising and adding additional strategic sponsors in North America and globally. The online advertising business has grown over 20% this quarter, as we have rolled out an improved livenation.com site, driving a 10% increase in site visits and therefore, greater advertising opportunities. Our ability to more effectively integrate content with the site has enabled deals with advertisers such as Kraft, Toyota and Pennzoil as they look for new ways to engage with our fan base. On a global basis, we continue to attract major brands to our platform, including Rdio signing up in the quarter to sponsor several festivals in North America and Yahoo! stepping in as the lead sponsor for our Wireless Festival in the U.K. Also, our EDM business, now at the scale of 17 festivals, is a tremendous new asset in our portfolio and is already driving incremental growth with sponsors looking to connect with its core youth market. At this point, between our first half AOI growth and book of business that is already been sold for the year, we expect continued consistent growth in Sponsorship & Advertising AOI for the full year. Next, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketing revenue was up 3%, and AOI increased 9%. The growth was driven by a 2% increase in global ticket sales benefiting from the very strong sales for Live Nation concert shows along with a 35% increase in secondary gross ticket value. As we continue through the year of redoubling our technology platform at Ticketmaster, we remain focused on 3 key areas for 2013. First, we will continue defending our market position, maintaining our leadership as the top fan destination for ticketing and through the first 6 months of the year, we have delivered a net renewal of over 100%. Second, growing our secondary business and deploying TM-Plus to set the stage for further growth in 2014. Michael gave you the update on our TM-Plus product rollout, but I also want to highlight that the team and league exchanges that we have in place with the NFL, NBA and NHL are growing rapidly themselves, up 29% through the first half of the year and further accelerating into July and as the NFL Exchange is launched for the upcoming season. And third, we're focused on improving and expanding ticket volume and management on mobile devices. We continue to see that mobile is where ticketing is headed and have again doubled the volume of global media tickets purchased in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2012, with mobile accounting for 8% of global ticket sales in the second quarter. We've seen this growth continuing at a rapid rate, helped by a new Ticketmaster app, which will allow ticket buyers to seamlessly purchase, transfer and sell tickets while also expanding the locations at which fans can have their tickets on mobile devices and scan them directly at the door. Given our expectations of flat to slightly increased ticket sales and increased secondary GTV [ph] along with continued investments in our re-platforming, mobile and secondary technology, we continue to expect Ticketmaster AOI will be roughly flat for the full year. Finally, Artist Nation. This year is a transition year for Artist Nation. The business has been in decline for the past several years, and we've taken a number of steps this year to stabilize it and reset the platform for more solid performance and growth going forward. Our focus now for the division is its core artist management activity, which represents about 70% of the division's AOI and generates a 20-plus -- 20% plus margin. On a like-for-like basis, the AOI for this business is stable for the first half versus last year. At this point, we have re-signed all the managers we see as the foundation for the business, and we are now working with them to grow by attracting new managers to their teams and more effectively, leveraging our sponsorship concert and data analytics businesses. Given this, as we look to the full year, we expect results to stay on trend with what we saw in the first half, both in terms of the stability of the management business and overall AOI generated by the division. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Kathy Willard, to take you through more details on our financials.
Elizabeth Katheleen Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now provide more details about our results for the second quarter and year-to-date and then discuss the rest of 2013. For the second quarter, revenue was $1.7 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2012. This growth was driven by Concerts improvement of 11% from increased shows and attendance in Europe, as well as higher activity in other global markets including Australia and new revenue from acquisitions. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter grew 10% to $160 million as compared to $146 million in 2012. All of our core segments contributed to this increase. Concerts AOI increased 18% from higher show count and attendance in Europe and Australia. Ticketing AOI for the quarter was up 9% from growth in international Ticketing markets, including the U.K., Ireland and Australia. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI grew 10% from higher online advertising, along with new sponsors. Operating income for the quarter was $98 million compared to $43 million last year. This improvement came from our higher AOI, as well as a $30 million gain on disposal of assets in our Concerts segment during the quarter. This gain is from the sale of our New York theater where we netted $22 million and also from insurance proceeds relating to the rebuild of Jones Beach in New York that was damaged by Hurricane Sandy last year. Net income for the quarter was $58 million compared to $8 million in 2012. Year-to-date, revenue was $2.6 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2012. Concerts, again, was the main driver of this growth with an increase of 12% over last year due to higher show count and attendance internationally, revenue from acquisitions and higher global touring activity. Sponsorship & Advertising was up 14% year-to-date, with an increase in online advertising sales of 23%, along with growth from new or expanded sponsorship agreements. Adjusted operating income for the 6 months grew 10% to $213 million as compared to $194 million last year. This AOI growth has been driven organically throughout the business, with acquisitions having no meaningful contribution. Concerts AOI more than doubled in the first 6 months from the strength of international shows, along with a higher global touring activity year-to-date. Sponsorship & Advertising grew 12% from their increased sales. And although ticketing AOI was up for the quarter, the 6 months results were down 5% because of the absence of the Olympics activity we had in 2012, along with the continued spend on the re-platforming project and other ticketing products. Artist Nation AOI is down $4 million compared to last year, but that is partially offset by the lower cost in Corporate due to the reorganization in this division at the end of 2012. For the 6 months of 2013, our overall AOI margin was 8%, which is consistent with the prior year. Operating income year-to-date was $65 million compared to 0 in the prior year. This improvement came from our higher AOI, as well as the gain on disposal of assets discussed above, which is $34 million for the 6 months. In addition, depreciation and amortization was lower by $9 million. Net income for the 6 months was a loss of $5 million compared to a loss of $61 million in 2012. Free cash flow was $102 million in the second quarter compared to $99 million last year due to the AOI improvement. And for the 6 months, free cash flow was $116 million in 2013 compared to $123 million in 2012. This slight decline is due to the tax refunds we received last year. Cash flow from operations was $380 million for the quarter -- I'm sorry, for the 6 months, up 23% over last year. As of June 30, we had total cash of $1.4 billion, which includes $479 million in ticketing client cash and $575 million in net concert event-related cash. Our free cash was $331 million. Total event-related deferred revenue was $868 million as of the end of June compared to $707 million in 2012, as our ticket sales for 2013 concerts continue to be strong, with sales up 26% through June as compared to this time last year. With the momentum in ticket sales that we saw at the end of last year continuing during 2013, we have strong confidence that we will have substantial growth in overall ticket sales for the year in Concerts. Total capital expenditures for 2013 through the second quarter were $55 million. We spent $27 million on maintenance items and $28 million on revenue-generating additions, including our ticket re-platforming project. This spend is slightly lower than last year's $59 million, but we continue to expect that our total capital expenditure for 2013 will be approximately $129 million. As of June 30, our total debt was $1.7 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discounts, is 5.3%. We continue to remain comfortably in compliance with our credit facility debt covenant requirements. As of June 30, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was under 3.75x versus a maximum of 4.5x. And our interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to net interest expense was over 5x versus a minimum ratio of 3x. We continue to monitor the credit markets and consider alternatives to take advantage of the favorable interest rate environment in both the senior debt and high-yield markets to potentially extend our maturities and improve the terms of our agreements. To that end, in the coming days, we plan to launch a refinancing of our senior secured credit facility. Overall, we are very pleased with our results for the first 6 months of 2013. As we move into the back half of the year, we continue to focus on driving profitability while investing in the future growth of the business through our ticketing platform project along with continued investments in resale, social and mobile technology. We remain confident in our growth expectations for the year. In summary, we continue to expect to deliver substantial growth in Concerts AOI in 2013. We expect Sponsorship & Advertising to deliver low double-digit AOI growth, and we expect ticketing AOI to be essentially flat to last year due to the loss of the 2012 Olympics earnings and continued investments in our ticketing product improvement. As a result, we currently expect margin improvement for the year in Concert, while our Ticketing and Sponsorship & Advertising segments margins will remain essentially flat to 2012. On free cash flow, we expect cash taxes of approximately $45 million to be paid in 2013, with the increase driven by the tax refunds received in 2012, along with improved AOI this year in taxpaying jurisdictions. Despite this cash tax increase, we currently expect free cash flow as a percentage of AOI to be consistent with last year based on our planned improvements in operations. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Tinker with Maxim Group.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Could you just -- you mentioned some areas were growing organically, the rest from acquisitions and others. As we try and figure out your growth rate, what -- how should we think about the size of acquisitions on that?
Michael Rapino: John, you're a little muffled there, but I think you were asking about acquisitions versus organic in general, you're talking? Are you talking on revenue ticket count? What parameters are you talking there?
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: [indiscernible] international acquisitions, and I'm trying to figure out how much of those helped your growth rate in terms of -- so what's organic and what's acquisition driven?
Michael Rapino: Got it. I think in general, if you look in 2013, things like Hong Kong and Singapore, our small acquisitions are just basically hirings. 2013, generally 100% of our AOI is organic. We have not added anything incremental from an acquisition perspective at this point. So we really haven't made any acquisitions over the last year of substance. Most of the expansions are low-cost entries. Insomniac is a -- while we did acquire, but we didn't have any of those effects on their business in the last quarter since we closed late.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: You mentioned that you still have a low share in the secondary ticket marketing business. You're quantifying about $4 billion. As you go out 2, 3 years when the new technology kicks in, the rebuilt Ticketmaster, what might be a kind of number we could start thinking about? Or is it possible to quantify that yet?
Michael Rapino: Well, we're not going to give you hard guidance on that. But we say triple, we're somewhere, I think, in some of our presentations we've showed you with our current NFL Exchange and TicketsNow and other fragmented pieces, we have somewhere in the low digits. So we expect that we should be able to capture 20% to 30% of the secondary business over time.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Evercore.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Just looking at the metrics on the Concert business, I mean, certainly one of the big upside surprises in the quarter was international, both in terms of the number of events. I mean, attendance was up huge, and U.S. -- North America a little more flat. But as you go into the seasonally important third quarter and you look -- you've already talked about the ticket sales, how do those 2, in terms of number of events and sort of estimated attendance, how does that look sort of big picture for North America versus international third quarter year-over-year?
Joe Berchtold: Well, let me just back you up. On a -- I want to make sure we get the credit here. As you know, a year ago, we talked about some changes in management over in Europe, and it was a focus for us to get the right leadership on the Concerts side with John Reid put in place. And he's done a fabulous job of rallying the troops and making sure we buy smarter, sell more tickets, get rid of the risk in the portfolio, some of the festivals and events in some of the markets like Spain and that, that weren't performing. So a lot of it has to do with just the execution of the team. When you look at a macro perspective, I think we've alluded to it in North America is going to have a very strong year as we finish Q3 in the amphitheaters. I think at the year, on a holistic perspective, North America is going to have an out-at-the-park summer and Europe will have continued year-over-year growth. But North America will be the star kind of, of the 2 when the season's over. But international has, as you've seen, bounced back and will hold that bounce for most of the year.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Yes, because, I mean, as a follow-up, Michael, you've talked about culling the number of festivals in Europe, at least you talked about that last year after the third quarter. I mean, is that going to impact international at all in Q3?
Michael Rapino: No. I mean, we -- the ones we canceled, we either added a better one or more importantly, just focused on the great stars that we have. When you have festivals like Reading and Leeds and Download and T In The Park, some of the, let's call them, the Coachellas of Europe, you're much better off spending a few extra dollars and time figuring out how to sell more tickets and sponsorship to that than driving some of the riskier ones. So we think the overall, our festivals will be stronger with the current portfolio, and there'll be no effect from the ones we canceled on a total basis from an operating [ph] perspective.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just finally then, I mean, the margin on the concert business in the second quarter, I mean, it's a record for a second quarter as far back as my numbers go. There may have been a higher number somewhere farther back. But I mean, the margin improvement in the Concert segment, which is a big source of leverage for you, seems to be -- have great momentum right now. That's always a little tricky in the big third quarter. But I mean, any thoughts on guidance there?
Joe Berchtold: Well, as we said, we do expect to see margin expansion in the Concerts business over the course of this year. In totality, as you said, a lot of it driven by Q2 and even more in Q3, particularly off of what Michael said in terms of having not just continued strong performance internationally, but having North America come along similarly in Q3.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Martin Pyykkonen with Wedge Partners.
Martin Pyykkonen - Wedge Partners Corporation: Two questions, one on the EDM opportunity. I know you mentioned the 17 festivals across U.S. and Europe, and I know this is still early and it's a relatively new burgeoning segment. But any comment you can make in terms of how much runway headroom is still out there to add festivals without saturating the market or getting diminishing returns? Just curious your sort of best guesstimate, if you will, on that. And then secondly, I know this is a long way off, but last year coming into the deep fall winter turned out to be a pretty good period relatively speaking, and I'm wondering if you have any kind of read on that based on who you're talking to, what artists may be thinking about and sort of the heartbeat of that as I was mentioning about the Garden reopens in full force. I know it's going to open in the winter last couple of years. And then you got the new venue of the L.A. Forum, which for better or worse, MSG certainly looks at that as a new additive venue, not displacing business from the Staples Center. I'm just curious if you agree with that and if you see the opportunity to fulfill a pretty strong pipeline of artists in there? I know the Eagles start out, but looking beyond that?
Michael Rapino: All right. That's a handful. I'll start with -- EDM has a great global runway. I mean, we're nowhere near saturation. This is the music of today's youth. There's some great festivals out there in Vegas and New York and et cetera, but huge, huge global demand. You look at things like -- markets like Canada. Montréal, Vancouver, Toronto don't even have an EDM event of this scale yet. Lots of smaller ones, but not scalable yet. So we look at Latin America, Europe, Asia, huge opportunity. We have had a flurry of opportunities and calls from around the world with people very interested to launch a Hard, Creamfield or an Insomniac-branded event. So we think we're at the start of the runway. We think we have, by far, the most cohesive best management team in the world, running it with James Barton from Creamfields, Pascal from Insomniac and Gary Richards from Hard. So we're not looking to have 10 or 12 companies running our strategy. We're looking for a small handful of what we think are the strong brands that have global expansion. The second piece of that runway that's just ready to explode is it's really not been broken by mainstream Madison Avenue yet. So again, my sponsorship team would tell me when they're out talking to the CMOs, one of the biggest question they get is how do we get into EDM, how do we get to that youth market. So we think sponsorship has a huge opportunity, and we think ultimately, the other piece that we'll bring to the equation as our new platform comes to life is most of EDM is not ticketed by Ticketmaster. It's ticketed by more small, independent sites. And we think as we build out a proper EDM white label opportunity for all of our businesses, we'll gain market share on the ticketing side. So we think it's a big leg in the stool, has huge opportunity all the way around. As far as next year, too early to tell. Usually, we wouldn't know this time of the year, other than the obvious big, big stars that may be talking about a big cycle next year. But too early to tell what the lineup will be, but we have no fear that there'll be a bunch of artist on the road next year and the pipe will be full. So that doesn't scare us at all. As far as the Forum in L.A., we're excited about it. We think it's a great historic venue. We think it will be a fabulous concert venue, and we think it might expand the market in L.A. given it will have no sports teams. So you're going to have a lot of availabilities for artists to start and do 2, 3, 4 nights in a market like L.A. We're thrilled to be the ticketing partner with MSG, and we're thrilled to be their largest supplier of content, working with Irving and Jim Dolan and then Hank and the team on both MSG and the Forum. So we think it's a good move for them, and we're happy to be in partnership with them on it.
Martin Pyykkonen - Wedge Partners Corporation: So just to clarify what I think you said on Sponsorship & Advertising revenues, we see it reported, it's pretty negligible what you've actually gotten in that revenue line from EDM at this point. But again, a lot of upside and runway?
Michael Rapino: Yes. But to date, it would be less than 1% of our sponsorship revenue might be EDM related, if that. So huge runway.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Rapino for closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: All right. Thank you, everybody. Have a great summer, and we'll talk on Q3.

Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2013 conference call. I'm joined today by Joe Berchtold, our COO; and Kathy Willard, our CFO. Let me start with a review of the first quarter. And I'm pleased that we delivered overall growth, with revenue up 6% and AOI up 10%, led by Concerts and Sponsorship double-digit growth year-on-year, in both revenue and AOI. We continue to see strong global demand for live events driving this growth, and giving us confidence that we'll have another strong year in 2013. Through April, global ticket sales at Ticketmaster for events in 2013 were up 8%, with the Concerts segment up 18%. Our Live Nation Concert ticket sales were up 26%, outpacing the market, indicating we are continuing to build market share in Concerts. On our last call, I outlined our 5 strategic drivers that will lead us to our 2015 AOI and cash targets. First, we will grow market shares in Concerts and Ticketing by 5 million tickets through new events, global expansion and higher per event conversion. With Concert tickets year-to-date up double digits, I expect that we will deliver over 1/2 of this growth in 2013 alone. It makes me highly confident we can deliver this target by 2015. Second, we will drive event awareness and ticketing conversion by shifting advertising spend to more direct and efficient social and digital channels. This year, all of Live Nation's national tours are utilizing digital and social media. And through April, we almost doubled the share of spend in these channels to 20% of our total marketing spend. And we see this as a contributing factor to our double-digit growth in attendance per show in the first quarter. Third, we will continue to deliver rapid growth in our Sponsorship & Advertising business through 2015. With 15% growth in Sponsorship AOI during the first quarter, we continue to distinguish our platform as the most effective way to connect brands with music trends. Fourth, we will grow our market share in the secondary business. We are off to a strong start this year with our NFL, NBA and NHL secondary partnerships, with our gross transaction value through April up over 20% from last year. I expect this to accelerate further once we launch our Ticketmaster Plus, our new integrated inventory product this summer. And fifth, we will reduce ticketing cost through our reap platforming project. We expect the project to be more than 75% complete by the end of 2013, with cost savings starting to be realized in 2014 and continue on plan to save $0.35 a ticket in North America from the project. Our first quarter results and ticket sales for 2013 events give me confidence in our ability to deliver 2013 AOI revenue and cash flow as expected with our 3-year plan. I will now turn the call over to Joe Berchtold, our COO, who will take you through a divisional update.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. First, on Concerts, Live Nation's Concerts revenue for the first quarter was up 14% and AOI improved by almost 50% versus 2012. The first quarter performance was driven by a 12% increase in global attendance, and in North America attendance was up 16% with a 33% increase in arena shows led by sellout tours with Lady Gaga, Rihanna and Maroon 5. Internationally, attendance was up 7% with particular strength coming out of Australia, with Red Hot Chili Peppers and Cirque du Soleil and Girls Aloud in Europe. Looking at our Concert ticket sales for all 2013 shows, we were up 22% year-on-year as of the end of the first quarter, with consistent growth in both North America and our international markets. We had 7 artists sell over 500,000 tickets each for our tours so far this year: Pink, Rihanna, Maroon 5, Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Bruce Springsteen and One Direction. And given this strong early start, we expect attendance at our Concerts to be up mid to high single-digits for the full year. Looking at this by market, first in North America, our amphitheaters are a big driver of this growth, with show count expected to increase by over 50 shows, while we also continue to increase our attendance per show and profitability per show. At the same time, arenas and stadiums have also shown substantial increases in both shows and big accounts, which we expect to continue through the year. Internationally, we're seeing the same thing with double-digit growth in our arena and stadium attendance so far, and we expect it to continue through the year. This is led by tours from Rihanna, Pink, Robbie Williams and Bruce Springsteen. On the festival side for Europe, we're seeing continued strength and demand for our shows across Northern Europe and the U.K., and we've reduced our activity in Southern Europe, notably Spain and Italy, to de-risk promoting in those markets. As a result, in total, we expect to be fairly flat year-on-year at about 3 million festival fans in Europe, keeping Live Nation, far and away, the largest festival operator in the world. As we have previously indicated, our other global priority is in festivals and Concerts, is electronic music. In the first quarter of this year, we almost tripled the attendance at our EDM shows to 350,000 fans, and for the full year, by leveraging our cream fields and hard brands and new partnerships being established, we expect to more than double EDM attendance to over 1.5 million fans. As part of this, we also expect to be actively managing our portfolio of assets, disposing of nonstrategic assets and reinvesting these proceeds in the EDM and festival spaces and international markets more broadly. Taking all of this together, we expect substantial Concerts AOI growth in 2013. Now turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. For the first quarter, revenue was up 11% and AOI was up 15%. This AOI growth was delivered consistently by both sponsorship and online advertising and across both North America and Europe. On the Sponsorship side, we continue to add strategic partners that we believe resonate well with our fans. Last quarter, we signed those to be a global partner for our festivals, bringing their highly regarded brand to our events and creating unique music experiences for their customers. And last week, we announced our Bud Light 50/50/1 sponsorship deal, wherein we are working with Bud Light to hold 50 Concerts in 50 states on August 1, leveraging the unique scale of Live Nation to deliver innovative sponsorship opportunities. Our online advertising is similarly off to a great start with double-digit AOI growth in the first quarter, as we created more content of livenation.com for brands to associate with. So based on first quarter performance and what we've already booked for the year, we expect Sponsorship to continue being one of our primary growth drivers, with full year 2013 AOI growth expected to be in the high single-digit to low double-digits, consistent with the past few years. Next, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketing revenue is down slightly, while AOI has declined by 18%. This AOI decline was driven by 2 factors: lower recognized ticket sales during the quarter and increased costs. We believe the lower recognized ticket sales figure is a function of timing, largely driven by the shift of over 1 million tickets from Q1 this year into Q4 of last year. We expect total ticket sales for the year to be flat to slightly up, as we continue to deliver a net renewal rate of over 100% and benefit from a strong year of Live Nation Concerts. Specific to that timing, while recognized ticket sales are down 3% for the first quarter, ticket sales for all 2013 events are up 5% when you include tickets sold in 2012 for 2013 shows and tickets deferred on Live Nation Concerts. Our increased costs for the quarter is tied to our 2 key strategic initiatives: re-platforming our ticketing technology; and product development for our secondary business. Looking at 2013 versus 2012, these cost increases are substantially front-loaded, given the ramp-up timing of our re-platforming and secondary product development in 2012. As a result, we expect Ticketing margins for the remainder of the year to be in line with last year's margins. Operationally, our Ticketing re-platforming project is now at its peak level, with over 200 engineers rebuilding our core ticketing engine and developing applications for our venue clients. We continue to plan on deploying many of our key apps by the end of this year, which will enable us to start reducing operating costs as we complete building the core infrastructure in 2014. On the secondary business, as Michael noted, our overall gross transaction value is up over 20% through April, driven by our deals in place with the NFL, NBA, and NHL teams and leagues. As we deploy our integrated secondary product in the third quarter, we will be leveraging this traffic along with a number of high-profile artist tours to deliver fans a simpler and safer buying experience. Underlying our secondary product strategy will be our mobile platforms, which continue their rapid growth. Through April, 10% of total Ticketmaster sales in North America were purchased on mobile platforms, double the same period in 2012. In March, for the first time, we sold over 1 million tickets worldwide on our mobile platforms, and we expect this trend to continue and accelerate. For the full year then, we are expecting our Ticketing AOI to be flat to slightly down, with our technology investments and not having Olympics ticketing this year offsetting our increases in ticket volume and operating efficiency gains. Lastly, Artist Nation. For the quarter, Artist Nation's revenue was down 18%, while our AOI losses were reduced by 63%. The sales decline is due to timing in our merchandise business, but at the same time, we were able to reduce costs by a greater amount through delivering improved AOI for the quarter. And more broadly, over the past 4 months, we streamlined and simplified the Artist Nation division to better position it for long-term sustainability and growth. The main change has been on the Artist Management side, where we worked with the managers to consolidate the management teams and define specific products and processes to enable them to more effectively tap into the Live Nation in Concerts, Sponsorship and Ticketing platforms. We believe this strategy of greater access will provide tangible benefits to the artists, enabling the managers to further differentiate how they can serve their clients and in turn, creating greater alignment between these managers and each of the Live Nation platforms. So in summary, based on our first quarter results, strong 2013 ticket sales across both Concerts and Ticketmaster and a growing committed book of business in Sponsorship, we expect 2013 to be our third consecutive year of strong growth in both revenue and AOI. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy Willard to take you through more details on our financials.
Elizabeth Katheleen Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide some more details about our first quarter results, and I will discuss what we see ahead for the rest of 2013. Let me start with the first quarter results. As you heard from Michael, we delivered strong results with growth in revenue and adjusted operating income, and also improved our operating income by 22%. For the first quarter, revenue was $924 million, up 6% over the same period in 2012. This increase was driven by Concerts, which improved by 14% compared to last year, through higher overall attendance, increased global touring activity with Lady Gaga and Rihanna on tour, and more North America arena shows and growth in Australia. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter grew 10% to $53 million, as compared to $48 million in 2012. Concerts drove this AOI growth, with a 48% increase from higher show count and attendance in North America, and growth in emerging markets including Australia. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI was up 15%, driven by growth in online advertising and sponsorship-related to venues. For the first 3 months of 2013, our overall AOI margin was 6%, which is flat compared to first quarter of 2012. In the first quarter, we had an operating loss of $33 million, compared to a $43 million loss last year, a 22% improvement. This was driven by the improved results in our Concerts segment and also led to an improvement in our net loss for the quarter, which was $63 million compared to $69 million last year. Free cash flow was $14 million in the first quarter compared to $24 million last year. This decrease year-over-year was due to a cash tax refund of $26 million that we received in 2012. Cash flow from operations was $270 million for the quarter, up 2% over last year. As of March 31, we had total cash of $1.2 billion, which includes $441 million in ticketing client cash and $503 million in net concert event-related cash. Our free cash was $302 million. Our total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $22 million. Approximately $12 million was maintenance expenditures and $10 million on revenue-generating additions. This spend is slightly lower than last year's $23 million at this time, and we continue to expect that our total capital expenditures for 2013 will be approximately $120 million. Total event-related deferred revenue was $774 million as of March 2013, as compared to $613 million in 2012, due to higher ticket sales for 2013 Concerts, which are up 22%, as compared to this time last year. This increase in deferred revenue and Concerts ticket sales, to date this year, provides strong momentum for the summer concert season. As of March 31, our total current and long-term debt, including capital leases was $1.73 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discounts is 5.2%. We continue to remain comfortably in compliance with our credit facility debt covenant requirements. As of March 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was under 4x versus the maximum of 4.5x, and our interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to net interest expense was over 4.5x versus the minimum ratio of 3x. While our weighted average cost of debt is at a historic low of 5.2%, we continue to consider alternatives to take advantage of the very favorable interest rate environment, in both the senior debt and high-yield markets. We delivered great results for the first quarter of 2013. Looking to the remainder of the year, we continue to focus on generating improved profitability while investing in the future growth of our business through our ticketing platform, as well as expansion in mobile, social and retail technology. Overall, our early results are solid, and we remain confident in our growth expectations for the year. Specifically, in 2013, we expect to deliver substantial growth in Concerts AOI, as Joe noted. Based on tour and festival timing this year, we expect to see some shift in activity from Q2 to Q3. We expect Sponsorship & Advertising to continue its steady high single to low double-digit AOI growth, and we expect Ticketing's AOI to remain flat to slightly down, due to the investments in our ticketing platform and the loss of the 2012 Olympics earnings from last year. As a result, we currently expect margin improvement for the year in Concerts, while our Ticketing and Sponsorship & Advertising segments margins will remain essentially flat to 2012. On our cash flow, we expect an increase of cash taxes to be paid in 2013, of roughly $40 million over last year because of our tax refunds received in 2012, along with improved AOI this year in taxpaying jurisdictions. Despite this cash tax increase, we currently expect free cash flow to still be at or above last year's level, based on our expected improvements in operations. Thank you for joining us today, and we will now open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Doug Arthur.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Kathy, Artist Nation AOI for the year, I think you had said on the fourth quarter conference call, you were looking, given all the transition in management and changes there, flat for the year. Is that still the outlook, or is it based on Q1, could you do a little bit better there?
Joe Berchtold: I think -- this is Joe, Doug. I think flat is still probably our best guess with the visibility we have at this point. We don't see a lot of movement from there.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. Then a follow-up, Joe, for you. You're adding a lot of amphitheater shows this summer. Are you confident you can, obviously, you are, given your guidance, manage that growth profitably with higher margins?
Joe Berchtold: Well, I think probably in our viewpoint, more important than the number of additional shows is how the shows themselves perform. And as I said, our expectation, you can do the math off of the -- off of what we gave you on ticket sales, is we think that our attendance per show will be up and our profitability per show will be up. That's really what matters most to us.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: I wanted to ask just a little bit about the outlook for the Ticketmaster business. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned kind of flattish for the year in terms of -- flat to maybe, I think, just slightly up in terms of volumes. With just the strength you're seeing in the concert market, let alone what you're seeing specifically at Live Nation, where are you seeing the give-back in terms of the volumes? Or is there something in the numbers that might impact kind of the reported volume statistics on a year-over-year basis?
Joe Berchtold: Yes. 100%. Remember, Ticketmaster counts the ticket sale when the sale is made, and Live Nation counts the ticket sale when the show occurs. So when Ticketmaster has a big Q4, which are all the Pink and Rihanna presales for 2013, they're counting that ticket sale and that revenue in Q4. We're not counting the sold-out Rihanna, or Pink tour until it happens now. So when we say ticket, Live Nation's ticket sales for 2013 events are up 26%, to look at Ticketmaster, and to put it on apples-to-apples, we'd also have to count Ticketmaster November, December ticket sales for anything that was for a 2013 show, to give you apples-to-apples. So overall, you're going to see, if you just do a 2013 where more tickets flow through Ticketmaster, regardless of whether the sale was in December or in the year '13, the answer will be yes, the business will be up, tickets will be up as will the Concerts.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Okay, no, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And I guess just a, kind of a, gauge your temperature in terms of the overall health of the business and what you see out there from the consumer, I thought your comments regarding Europe at the margin were probably a bit more optimistic than I would have expected. You seem like you're very comfortable with the summer lineup. Do you feel like you're incrementally more positive about the business and what you're seeing out there relative to maybe where you were 2 months ago when we last spoke? Are we right in picking it up that maybe the business is operating maybe a little bit ahead of where you expected maybe 2 months ago?
Joe Berchtold: I think that's a fair assessment. I think we're feeling, on a global basis -- when you're sitting with 26% ticket sales up year-over-year and you're as big as we are to start with, as you know those are big gains on a big base. So we're very confident that it's a strong season. Consumer seems to be coming back very strongly, both in America and in Europe. And remember, most of our business in Europe is in the North. So I'm not betting on a Spain or an Italy recovery, but in Northern Europe where the bulk of our volume is, Ireland and England, London, Paris, Sweden, the Nordics, Holland, those markets seem to be doing very well year-over-year. And a lot of it has to do with our teams just executing a lot better this year than last year. We bought smarter. We reduced some risky events. We shut down some festivals that weren't working. So I think we'll grow our business, both through execution and a slight increase in the consumer spend over there. And in North America, the consumer seems to be coming back very strong to the show.
John M. Healy - Northcoast Research: Okay, great. And this is just a last question. I think in your remarks you mentioned maybe a reallocating some resources on non-core assets. And I thought you were talking maybe about the focus in terms of where you were looking to promote shows. I wasn't sure if that was by a specific genre of music or in certain areas of the country. So I was hoping to understand a little bit more about that statement, as well as your thoughts on kind of more future growth. I think there were some press reports out in the last week or 2 about some interest in some electronic music opportunities. What does the acquisition pipeline look like? And should we expect a bit more activity there in the not too distant future?
Joe Berchtold: Yes, I think we've been consistent that we think that there's 2 opportunities to continue to grow the business from a portfolio perspective. One is always an international expansion, where you continually see us whether organically, as we did in Russia, or whether we bolt on a strong promoter like we did in Australia. But we think there's still great opportunity in Latin America and in the Pacific Rim, and also in Eastern Europe. So lots of markets for us to continue to expand, both Live Nation and our Ticketing business. You'll see us do that. And then on the other end, think about we have 100 offices in over 35, 40 countries. Those are the outlets. But what's really important is that you're putting the content through. So the more shows we buy, the more content we have, the more fans that will walk through the doors. Ultimately, our business model works and ultimately, sponsorship lays on top of that. So we're always looking at our portfolio to make sure we got a diverse and renewed content platform. So country happens to be on fire in North America. So we're continuing to look, and we launched a country festival in Michigan this year. If you look around the world, we've been saying it for the last couple of years, electronic music is a global phenomenon globally. Every country is looking, from a club to Vegas to a festival, to look to get into that space. So we're going to look to build upon our cream fields and hard acquisitions, and if we can find the right deal to build that piece of our business, we will. And we've talked about continuing to grow our festival business in North America. It's probably the one piece of the overall portfolio that we're under-serviced in. So we think we'll accomplish that through electronic music. You look at a company like Insomniac, they have the second largest festival in the world in Vegas, after Rock in Rio, 300,000 tickets. So they are -- electronic music is truly a festival business in itself. So we'll look to either electronic music and we'll look to traditional festivals in North America, whether organically or some bolt-on acquisitions to keep driving our portfolio.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from John Tinker with Maxim Group.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Just a follow-up on Insomniac, what kind of multiples do you have to pay to buy into these festivals now, if the cost was $50 million?
Michael Rapino: It's a good question, John. You're straight out there. You know we're not going to comment on anything until we get deals done. But I would say that, good properties, festivals that are doing really well, are probably going to get a decent multiple. So every deal is different. Lots of content out there. I would say, other -- we're certainly -- unlike maybe some others out there, we're not desperate, nor do we need to buy a lot. So we buy, and if we think that we have the right festival to add to our portfolio, we like buying -- we don't like buying 100% of these businesses. We like the entrepreneur to have some upside and risk in the game with us to build the businesses. So we tend to look for businesses where we think they've got a strong foundation, an exceptional entrepreneur at the helm. And more importantly, that they can use our distribution to grow that asset like we've done with Festival Republic in Europe, like we've done with Roc Nation here. So we'll continue to look for the right acquisition that we think works with our distribution. And then ultimately, we look for, is regardless of maybe what that asset makes today, where can we take that business over the next 2, 3 years, and can we grow that business with a strong return for our shareholders, when you put their content plus our distribution together.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: You mentioned that mobile, it's adding -- it's about 10% of ticket sales. Is there any difference in the kind of person who buys mobile rather than online? And that do you think you're reaching a new audience in any way, or is this getting rid of some of the inefficiency out there where people haven't heard of the tickets, perhaps hearing of them now, and then it's easy to buy? Or is this just business as usual, but just a different platform?
Michael Rapino: We think long-term, it's absolutely an aid to conversion in selling more tickets to, let's call it the casual buyer. We think any time that you can make something this convenient versus having to run back to your computer and log in, that if any time you're sitting with that phone in the car or wherever you may be, and you can instantly buy 2 tickets to the Rihanna show, we think that's going to drive ticket sales. We know from early data that when we send out our email blasts and our mobile blasts, that you look at -- a traditional email converts online at 10% to 15%. When you start sending out mobile alerts, they're converting somewhere in the 20% to 30% range because you're delivering probably a context -- a content-rich message and an immediacy. And we're seeing some great conversion on mobile. Believe it or not, the fan is young and old. We sold out a Paul McCartney show in Canada on a mobile presale. So let's assume that's an older demo, as well as electronic music and Rihanna. So young and old, I think the consumer just looks at it as an efficient channel. We love it because we get to take all the same economics to that channel, and we get to start directly communicating with users of mobile alerts and bringing email to live -- to a conversion on your mobile phone. So we think it will be a big part of the future of how we increase our conversion rate.
John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division: Would you warrant a guess as to what the percentage of business might be, desktop to mobile, in 2 or 3 years?
Michael Rapino: I think it's just -- it's only limited right now, really by the adoption of the ecosystem versus the consumer. So I think as you see all ticketing companies, ourselves included, ramping up our apps, our transferability and more importantly, all the scanner equipment needed at the venues, but over the next -- so we're equipping daily, converting venues to make sure they're able to scan that digital ticket. And I think over the next few years, you'll see that 10% double and triple fairly fast as the system catches up to the consumer.
Operator: And we'll take a question from Doug Arthur with Evercore.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Yes, Michael, this might be a little bit repetitive, but can you just remind us with the Ticketmaster re-platforming, what are -- for the venue operator, going from kind of old to new system, what are the 3 key upsides for the venue operator when this thing is finally up and running 100%?
Michael Rapino: Just from a venue perspective?
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Michael Rapino: Not our end. Well, for a venue, Ticketmaster is truly a partner in the ticket-selling operations. So if you are a venue that has our box office, installed our software, you trained on our platform, we're your support team, we are your complete, let's call it Salesforce.com. We're the center hub, where all of those tickets flowing through your venue, your biggest revenue stream, the heartbeat of your business. To date, we've been a fairly transaction-based platform, as I've shown you at our presentations, green screen and fairly bulky. As we've now started to launch already some new business apps, reporting and inventory, we start to become a much deeper partner with you. So on the first and most important, some of the venues that now have our new platform tools or part of the tools, we're providing incredible analytics and reporting on ticket sales. So on our old system, you knew that you sold 5,000 tickets at 10:00 for a show or a sporting event. Today, you're looking at a beautiful user interface that's showing you those 5,000 tickets. We're giving you demo breaks. We're giving you age. We're giving you analytics on where they came from, how they found out about the show. So we have a deep bench of analytics that we can provide to you and upsell to you, so you can really understand your customer and how their buying patterns emerged. We're second to launch a deep marketing platform with this, so we're going to be able to really help you now market those shows once you build the show, integrating to Facebook, buy ads for you online, show you where your customers are, give you target-specific CRM tools so you can really look deep into your database and your customer base to look for how to reach those fans. And we're also -- really important from both of our ends, we're giving you full control of the inventory through our inventory app. So again, to date, if you're a venue, you got to call Ticketmaster to get most things done. Think of our platform to date, where it's a completely managed system, you need to call me, Ticketmaster, to change ticket data, to do most of the basics. With our new inventory app, you can sit in the box office, change the ticket prices, build the show yourself, make all the changes you need, so a complete self-managed platform with us at the user-face behind it. So if you look at the simplistics, what does the platform do? Aside from it -- that it's got a great user interface and it's competitive with anyone else out there, no one has the data depth that we have. So now, you truly have not just the ticket-selling platform, but you have a platform that's providing you incredible data to help you sell, target, and hopefully, ultimately, the end goal is we're going to help you sell more tickets, drive revenue, because we brought a full suite of services around the consumer base to your fingertips.
Operator: And we'll take a question from Andrew Rittenberry with Jennison.
Andrew Rittenberry: A question for Joe or Michael. Joe, I think you mentioned the secondary product integration, that you're going to roll that out in the third quarter. Would you guys mind filling us on your strategy there, and I think you mentioned you were going to market that with a couple of large tours, et cetera. But can you just kind of fill us in on the product, and how you're going to market that, et cetera?
Michael Rapino: So we're going to launch TM Plus this summer. We've already got a head start, obviously, with the sports business because we have relationships with the NHL, NBA and NFL. So we are the official secondary partner with those 3 leagues. So you'll start to see those teams and venues, a part of our integrated inventory this summer. And then you'll also start to see, as we're selling through the concert season, you'll start to see, first, most importantly, we'll start with our Live Nation shows since we can help kind of sell those in for our partner, and then we'll expand out from there. So we're looking to beta launch it in July. And we have adoption rates from July on to December on getting inventory up and available, as we've kind of missed the concert season on purpose because of the load. So we're ready for next summer in terms of the full season, but we'll still be able to catch the back end of the year in the Concert business, and we'll be able to get most of the on-sales for the sports leagues for the fall. So we're in selling-in through all of the different constituents right now. I think our sales pitch is easy, honestly. It's a sales pitch that starts with, we work for you, the content. You're not participating today, there's $4 billion sitting somewhere else. You don't have the data. You don't participate in the revenue. We think that you should be. So we're working for you and we want you to share in some of that revenue and share in some of that data, and it seems to be well received to date.
Andrew Rittenberry: Got it. I guess one more follow-up question. I think it's the first call in a couple of years where no one's asked about the CTS arbitration, so I guess I'll ask about it. Any update there to share with us?
Michael Rapino: No, it's almost the old question at this point. But we continue to think that it's going to be soon. We're nearly hearing from the arbitrator and the counsel that a decision will be coming soon. So we would assume that, again, as I've said for 2 years, we think it's coming soon.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Ben Mogil with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Kathy, on the free cash flow guidance that you gave, are you including all CapEx, like revenue and maintenance, or are you just including maintenance? And then how do you also see in that number the distribution to minority partners, sort of when viewed on a year-over-year basis?
Elizabeth Katheleen Willard: So it is our definition of free cash flow, so it does not include revenue-generating, when I'm talking about that guidance. And we don't see dramatic changes in our minority-interest partners. Year-over-year, we will probably see a little bit of growth in Europe coming out of on Concerts and that will drive that some. But that number won't dramatically increase.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And can you remind us what is your -- what was your maintenance CapEx number for '12, and the breakdown of what do you think it will be for '13?
Elizabeth Katheleen Willard: Yes. 2012's maintenance was $62 million and expecting a pretty similar number for 2013.
Michael Rapino: That's TM and Live Nation.
Elizabeth Katheleen Willard: Yes, that's combined.
Michael Rapino: That's everything.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Sure. And then Michael, question for you on the TicketsNow platform. The sports leagues, at least right now, have minimum floors. Can you talk about, the best that you can given confidentiality, et cetera, what conversations you've have with them about sort of looking to remove some of them to make the site better for them effectively?
Michael Rapino: Better, sorry, what was that -- repeat the last part?
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Sure. Well, I mean, have you -- what kind of conversations have you had with the sports leagues about removing some of the price floors that they basically implemented on TicketsNow, that if you can get rid of those floors, that would obviously make that product for their customers more competitive with some of the other retail sites out there? What kind of, sort of conversations -- and better for them, obviously, because they participate in the revenue as well, then being in the leagues. Can you sort of talk about where their minds are at around price floors, et cetera?
Michael Rapino: Well, I think we -- as I said already, we're in business with content, so we're going to do what's right from their perspective. And I think, there's been lots of talk about what MLB has done and selling tickets in the nosebleeds too cheaply. So I think it's a fine line that if you're going to open up some of the doors to secondary, to try to take advantage of some of the inefficiencies in the top-end pricing, and you also have to protect your core customers who are buying everyday on the bottom end. So we don't look at the advantage of secondary to figure out how to sell discount tickets. We look at secondary as an opportunity to figure out how to capture some of the inefficient low-priced top end. So I don't think you'll see floors removed. I think that's a pretty smart basis for the product. But to your core idea, just so we're clear, our goal in life isn't that TicketsNow grows dramatically on its own and competes against StubHub. Our strategy is that Ticket Plus, the Ticketmaster Plus that we'll launch this fall or the spring/summer will be the way that we best are able to take -- tackle the secondary business. So we think our main front-door, having that big traffic that Ticketmaster gathers, is the best way to sell you a primary and/or a secondary ticket when you come shopping the first time.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: How long is the StubHub MLB deal? Do you know?
Michael Rapino: I don't know.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And have you gotten any feedback from MLB owners? I mean I know, just because you obviously, you sell tickets from MLB as well. Any feedback from them on terms of how they're feeling about that deal so far?
Michael Rapino: We don't comment on the other guys. We just know what the leagues are doing with us at this point, and we seem to be fulfilling most of their needs on the business right now, and lots of opportunity on the upside.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Rapino for closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everybody. Have a great summer, and we'll talk to you on Q3.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 conference call. I am joined today by Joe Berchtold, our COO; and Kathy Willard, our CFO. Let me start with overall 2012 financial performance. We delivered revenue and AOI growth across our 3 core businesses of Concerts, Sponsorship and Ticketing. For the company, revenue grew 8%, AOI was up 5% and free cash flow increased 36% for the year. Underlining the solid financial performance is growth in ticket sales and market share in both Concerts and Ticketing businesses with global ticket sales for the year up 4% for Concerts and 5% at Ticketmaster. Our success in 2012 following our growth in 2011 is demonstrating the strength of our live entertainment platform and the resilience of the live business. On a global basis, the industry grew and North America has bounced back from the economic slowdown of a few years ago. We continue to see strong fan demand and growth last year across concerts, sporting and family events, and our market research showing that 90% of fans who attended one of these events last year plan on going to the same or more events this year. From both our results and what the fans are saying, live events continue to show they are inherently non-duplicatable, in high demand and globally transferable. Our business model is based on maximizing ticket sales in the broader ecosystem around the live event. We grow the business by increasing our Ticketing market share and driving these adjacent businesses. As a result, we continue to see 2 core growth opportunities, increasing our 400 million ticket base, which drives our entire vertical economics. We've already have shown strong market positions in North America and Europe and have shown over the past 2 years our ability to continue to grow market share in these markets. And we see further high-growth opportunities and incremental ticket sales in EDM and festivals, secondary ticket and emerging markets, 3 areas we will continue to focus on. The second key to building on our more than 400 million ticketing base is increasing conversion. We've talked before about the 30% of fans that miss the show because they didn't hear about it and the number of tickets that go unsold for most shows. The increase in conversion is the most direct return on our business. Adding one more ticket sale to the 200,000 events across Ticketmaster and Live Nation drops right to our bottom line. As we indicated last fall, we've aligned our business against 5 initiatives to deliver on these core opportunities of increasing market share and conversion. Our first objective is -- has been to grow market share in Concerts and Ticketing by 5 million tickets, through new organic events, global expansion and higher per-event conversion. Second goal is to drive Ticketing conversion per event by shifting our advertising from traditional to more efficient social and digital. Third, we want to grow our market share in secondary, and we will achieve this through our new online mobile product launch this year. Our fourth initiative is to continue to grow our advertising base through higher audience and CPMs. And finally, reduce our ticketing costs by transitioning 400 million tickets on to our updated Ticketing platform starting in 2014. In 2012, we delivered on both market share and conversions objectives. And in 2013, after 2 years of investment in new technology, we will launch new products in the marketplace that will excel these results, and I am confident we're on track to deliver our 3-year plan and I'm reaffirming our guidance of 30% to 35% AOI growth by 2015. I'll now turn this over to Joe Berchtold, our COO, to take you through the performance of each of these initiatives across our business segments and our outlook for 2013.
Joe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. First, in Concerts, the Live Nation Concerts revenue was up 10% in 2012 while adding 2 million fans, bringing us to 49 million attending our shows globally. Our AOI grew 4% for the year, but if AOI is adjusted for the $6.9 million of incremental marketing spend in the fourth quarter specifically targeted at shows occurring in 2013, our AOI would have been up 26%. Looking more specifically at what worked in 2012, first we continued to have success with our North America amphitheaters. For the year, we grew our show count by 12%, attendance by 15% and increased overall line of business contribution margin by 13%. Our continued development of newer acts for the amp is working, with artists who had their first hit in the 2000s, representing half of the top 10 amp tours last year, including Jason Aldean, Drake and Big Time Rush. Another high point for the year was our festival business in general and EDM in particular. In 2012, global festival attendance increased 30% to 3.5 million attendees, and EDM doubled attendance across all of its shows with 1.4 million attendees. Our primary challenge last year was with our European Concerts business, which suffered from inconsistent fan demand, particularly in Southern Europe where we saw a 15% decrease in attendance per show. And this decrease offset the benefit from our increased show count, which is why we ended with growth in attendance below our overall results. An early look at 2013 indicates that our shows are off to a great start with 9 million tickets sold as of December 31 for Live Nation concerts in 2013. This is a 58% increase over last year, and it's consistently strong across the globe with North America up 36%, led by One Direction and Maroon 5, and Europe up 80% driven notably by early sales of Bruce Springsteen and Rihanna. This increase in 2013 show sales is why we had the $6.9 million increase in fourth quarter marketing spend. So that $6.9 million delivered about 3.5 million incremental tickets relative to last year. A bit more on Europe for 2013. Ticket sales have continued strong since the first of the year with some particular highlights, including the Olympic Park in London. We put our first 2 shows of Wireless Festival on sale last week and sold out over 100,000 tickets the first day of on sale for those 2 shows. Overall for Europe, concert ticket sales since the first of the year are up about 25% through February 18 with consistent performance across festivals, arenas and clubs. As a result, we remain optimistic we'll see real improvements in 2013 for Europe over the course of the year. And so based on our sales to date and lineup for this year, we expect Concerts to deliver strong AOI growth in 2013. Next, Ticketmaster. As Michael mentioned, global ticket sales were up 5% in 2012, driving revenue up 4% for Ticketing, while AOI was up 6% despite increased investment in our technology re-platforming project and initiatives in mobile, social and secondary. Throughout last year, we highlighted that for Ticketmaster, there were 2 main objectives: first, maintaining the net renewal rate of over 100%; and second, making real progress on our technology re-platforming project. By continuing to deliver a net renewal rate of over 100%, we're getting market validation that Ticketmaster is the most effective global Ticketing distribution platform with a scale continuing to distance it from all other ticketing companies. And then our re-platforming project, we're now more than halfway through its development. And last year, we delivered 4 products to over 1,000 clients, and we continue to be on schedule and on budget. Our investments in mobile continue to pay off as well with 7% of North America tickets sold via mobile in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011. For 2013 shows, again we're off to a strong start. Through February 23, sales of Ticketmaster for shows in 2013 are up 10% with an 11% increase in North America and 5% internationally. This number is certainly helped by the earlier on-sales of a number of our concerts in the fourth quarter of 2012, as we discussed, but it also gives us comfort that the consumer demand for live events remain solid, both North America and internationally. The strength is also coming through in the fan visits to our online and mobile platforms, which were collectively up 17% in North America for January this year versus January 2012. So now as we look at 2013 overall for Ticketmaster, we're expecting AOI to be roughly flat with ticketing growth and operating efficiency gains offset by increased technology investments and not having the Olympics ticketing this year. Turning to our Sponsorships & Advertising business. For the full year, revenue was up 7%, and AOI was up 6%. On a constant currency basis, AOI was up 9%. And these results came close to what we had hoped for, for the business for the year with strong growth in our core Sponsorship business with amphitheaters and festival sponsorship contribution margin up 12% as we continued to build new sponsorable products at these events and our growth in online advertising coming in a bit short with 4% growth in contribution margin. This was below expectations as the deployment of our new LN.com site came a bit later in the fourth quarter than expected. And in 2013 then, we expect Sponsorship to continue being one of our primary growth drivers with AOI increases consistent with the past few years. Finally, Artist Nation. Artist Nation's revenue for the year was up 2%, and AOI for the year was $38 million, down $9 million or 19% from last year. Adjusting for onetime items, AOI was $44 million, a decline of 8%. This drop in performance was driven by the results of our management business, where AOI fell by over 20% prior to the impact of any onetime costs. As we look then at the impact of our December 31 transaction related to the departure of Irving Azoff, we had onetime hits to our AOI and net income with little go-forward effect. First, the onetime impact. We took a $5.5 million write-off that hit AOI for specific costs associated with the departure of 26 employees and 12 artists under management. These costs were a mix of severance and writing off contracts that run through 2013. Second, we had a note payout, which was an acceleration of payments that would have otherwise been made through 2013 that increased expense by $5.2 million. This hits our net income line but not AOI, and it's simply a shift in timing between 2012 and 2013. Finally, we had an impairment of $63 million for the Artist Management business. This impairment was determined by calculating the net present value of future cash flows expected from the management business relative to the current book value for those businesses. This shortfall came about because this business is now expected to deliver less profit than was projected at the time of the Ticketmaster merger. We've also done a further assessment on the overall economics of our purchase of the final 25% of Front Line done in the first quarter of 2011, and we continue to expect the return on this investment above our cost of capital due in part to the tax shield benefits of this purchase. Looking forward, we believe there will be no material impact to our ongoing operating results. The 26 employees who departed were budgeted to deliver $10 million to $15 million of revenues for the business through their management of 12 artists. At the same time, our budgeted costs for these employees and the management of those artists were expected to be a comparable amount. So as a result, we expect no material impact and for our 2013 AOI to be largely in line with 2012 profitability. Going forward, we plan on maintaining Artist Nation as a distinct division with some simplification of focusing on Artist Management and merchandise. There are a handful of smaller businesses that will shift between divisions but, in aggregate, will not have a major impact on divisional numbers. So in summary, 2012 was our second successive year of delivering revenue, profit and cash flow growth for the business overall and across most of our divisions. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to take you through more details on our financials.
Elizabeth Katheleen Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. For the 12 months ended December 31, we have delivered growth in revenue, AOI and free cash flow, as Michael noted. I will now walk you through the key financial highlights for the quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.4 billion, up 21% compared to 2011. Concerts revenue was up 32% driven by higher global touring activity with Madonna and Lady Gaga both on tour compared to no global tours in the fourth quarter of last year. And Ticketing revenue was up 6% from higher ticket sales and increased resale activity. Adjusted operating income was up for the fourth quarter to $63 million compared to $51 million last year, an increase of 23%. Concerts AOI was up 9% compared to last year, or $3 million, due to improved North America results. Ticketing AOI increased 5%, or $3 million, due to higher ticket sales and resale activity. Artist Nation AOI was down $7 million in the quarter, largely due to the $5.5 million of costs that Joe mentioned, and Sponsorship & Advertising AOI was up 4% with increased results from festivals and strategic sponsorships. For the quarter, we reported an operating loss of $126 million compared to a loss of $67 million last year with the decline driven by the impairment of $63 million related to the intangible asset in the Artist Nation segment. For the full year 2012, revenue was $5.8 billion, up 8% over 2011. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 10%. Concerts revenue increased 10% compared to the prior year with higher overall attendance, increased global touring activity, more amphitheater shows and International expansion in Australia and Asia. Ticketing revenue for the year increased 4% as a result of higher ticket sales in North America and Europe, London Olympic fees and resale growth. And Sponsorship & Advertising revenue grew by 7% driven by increased custom client-branded events and festival sponsorship, along with online advertising growth. Adjusted operating income for the year grew 5% to $459 million compared to $438 million in 2011. Joe has already detailed out the AOI changes by division. One other item to note is that overall, our AOI was reduced by $8 million year-over-year due to currency fluctuations across all the markets we serve. For the full year 2012, our overall AOI margin is 7.9%, which is slightly down from 2011's margin of 8.1%. Concerts margin is flat with the declines we saw in Europe affecting the North American growth. Ticketing's margin is slightly up. Sponsorship & Advertising's margin is down a little as we ramped up our digital sales force in 2012 in advance of the livenation.com relaunch. And Artist Nation is down due to the reduced performance of the management business. For 2013, we currently expect margin improvement in Concerts and Artist Nation, with Ticketing and Sponsorship essentially flat. So we will see a slight uptick overall. For the full year 2012, we had an operating loss of $22 million compared to operating income of $18 million last year. This decline was due to the $63 million intangible impairment charge in Artist Nation, although 2012 benefited from a $24 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense related to the 2011 Front Line buyout. Our net loss for the full year 2012 was $163 million compared to a loss of $83 million in 2011. This decline was driven by the intangible impairment of $63 million as well as the 2011 net benefit related to the Front Line buyout of $27 million. Without these onetime items in Artist Nation, our net loss for the year would have improved over last year by 13%. For the quarter, free cash flow was $1 million compared to a loss of $20 million last year with the improvement driven by higher AOI and lower interest expense. For the full year, free cash flow was $276 million versus $203 million last year. This 36% increase in 2012 is due to the improved AOI and cash tax benefit from the 2011 Front Line buyout. We are pleased with this growth as our free cash flow-to-AOI ratio increased from 46% to 60% this year. Cash flow from operations was $367 million for the year, up 59% from $231 million in 2011. This improvement comes from higher deferred ticket sales for future shows, net of the increased prepaid cost for those events, a net increase of $100 million; client cash timing, which drives an increase of $78 million; tax receivables that we noted as outstanding at the end of 2011 that were collected in 2012; and higher operating results. The free cash flow we generated in 2012 was used for revenue-generating capital expenditures of $60 million, including the Ticketing re-platforming; $67 million in payments related to acquisitions of businesses and other rights, net of borrowings; debt principal payments of $37 million; and we had positive working capital in 2012. As of December 31, we had total cash of $1 billion, which includes $442 million in Ticketing client cash and $219 million in net concert event-related cash. Our free cash was $340 million. Our total capital expenditures for 2012 totaled $123 million. We spent approximately $63 million on maintenance expenditures and $60 million on revenue-generating additions. The increase over last year's $112 million was driven by the cost for the Ticketing re-platforming along with other purchases of technology and venue equipment. We currently expect that our 2013 capital expenditures will be consistent with 2012. Total deferred revenue was $402 million as of December 31, 2012, compared to $274 million in 2011 driven by higher concert ticket sales for 2013 events, which are up 58% compared to this time last year. This increase in deferred revenue improves our cash position as well as gives us optimism towards ticket buying patterns for 2013. As of December 31, our total current and long-term debt, including capital leases, was $1.74 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discounts, was 5.2%. We continue to remain comfortably in compliance with our credit facility debt covenant requirements. As of December 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to be under 4x versus the maximum of 4.5x, and our interest coverage ratio of EBITDA-to-net interest expense was over 4.5x versus the minimum ratio of 3x. We are pleased with the solid results our businesses delivered in 2012. Looking forward, 2013 will be a year focused on generating improved profitability while continuing to invest in the future growth of our business through investments in our Ticketing platform as well as expansion in mobile, social and resale. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2012 update. And we will now open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Bill -- I'm sorry, Ben Mogil with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: In terms of Sponsorship bookings, can you give us a sense of where you are now, say, compared to this time last year, both directionally and either dollar figure up or down or percentage up or down?
Joe Berchtold: Yes, this is Joe, Ben. I think that if you refer back to our belief that this year will be up consistent with the past couple of years' growth in AOI, then, obviously, at this point of the year, we've got enough between what we have booked and in the pipeline to give you that guidance.
Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the longer issue of the sort of the 2015 guidance, when you look at that sort of guidance -- and you talked a lot about at the Liberty Day of sort of adding 5 million attendees per year largely through Electronic Dance Music and festivals -- how much of that do you think you can do organically? How much of that do you think you need to do M&A for? And what are the M&A multiples? And what's the M&A environment looking like from where you guys sit?
Michael Rapino: There's a quick question, isn't it, Ben? First of all, we didn't say 5 million a year, we said 5 million over the 3-year we were referring to. I think we're close to a couple of million now of that 5 million. So we would hope that -- if you look at the 2 million out of the 5 million that we've delivered, most of that's organic because the easiest and most effective way for us to get that 5 million is for Ticketmaster and Live Nation to sell a few more tickets to their current shows. So our first objective is always social media, mobile conversion, online conversion, sell more tickets to our current events to get close to that 5 million. So I would say a large majority of it will become or should come organically through better sell-through. And then opportunistically, as we've done in the past, we'll find some tuck-in, bolt-on promoters or ticketing companies either in America or around the world if we think they're strategic to our growth and always looking at our cost of capital and return on those.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Martin Pyykkonen with Wedge Partners.
Martin Pyykkonen - Wedge Partners Corporation: Two things on Concerts. I was wondering, just looking at the numbers, number of tickets sold up 11%, concert revenue up 31% and ticket -- gross ticket value up just under 16% in the quarter just for Q4. Can you talk to how much of that do you think was from dynamic pricing and particularly pricing the front of the house getting the real premium that you deserve versus to what extent it was just bigger artist, bigger ticket prices as a result? Just trying to get underneath a little bit to understand quantitatively how much dynamic pricing is helping.
Joe Berchtold: Yes, Martin, this is Joe. I think first of all, looking at one quarter can be tough, especially on Q4 for us. As Kathy indicated, we had some global tours out. Those tend to be higher ticket prices. So probably, that will create some distortion, just the nature of the tours, particularly in the fourth quarter, more than any of our specific pricing initiatives. That said, I think as we've talked in the past, we've rolled out pretty aggressively our dynamic pricing in our amphitheaters and saw some nice return off of that through the second and third quarter. And we've seen even more success on what we call Platinum pricing, which is where we just start our pricing where we have a number of tickets in the front of the house that are at a premium price. So no doubt that's delivering some real value to our concert business that, frankly, is just coming through more in the second and third quarter.
Michael Rapino: And I would say, Martin, just to add to that, I mean, the important part for us because when the tide rises, we will gain the most. The business in general over the last 2 years, every artist, every business manager, agent has just gotten smarter about pricing the house. And I would say 2 years ago, everyone was slightly panicked about the economy. It was in a bit of a stalemate. I think today, 80% to 90% of the dates we do, that conversation starts with either, after them initiating, how do we scale the house more effectively, which really means how do we price the front of the house to meet the market and maybe reduce the prices in the back end. But every time an artist participates in that kind of conversation, it's a higher revenue event for us. So I think we've been the leaders, obviously, in the marketplace with our Pricemaster tool, getting over 1,000 artists or 1,000 shows working it through last year. And I think it's becoming a pretty ingrained trend now in the business, which will absolutely help our overall revenue growth.
Martin Pyykkonen - Wedge Partners Corporation: And then just kind of a part B to that. I think Kathy mentioned the AOI margin should be up a little bit this year for the Concerts segment. What -- number one, is that -- did I get that accurately? And how much of that would be from better, smarter pricing continuing just on a -- ongoing improvements as opposed to something that's more cost driven? And I think the quantity of [indiscernible], just more directionally where that's going.
Elizabeth Katheleen Willard: Yes. Right. You have the stat correct. That's what we're saying, it'll be up slightly. And it is driven a lot by selling more tickets and better pricing on those tickets.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Evercore.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Yes, Kathy, I just want to -- I mean, I know you're not going to give full year guidance, but you did -- I mean, between you and Joe, you sort of said Ticketing, you're sort of looking for flat based on the cost and the re-platforming continuing. Artist Nation, I guess, all else being equal, sort of flat. So Sponsorship, I mean, yes, it's grown at a nice clip, but it seems like if you go back a year, 18 months ago, that you really felt that would be a long-term, double-digit grower. So are you -- do you think you can get back there this year? And then, I guess, the balance of the upside would come from constant margins. And then, Michael, as a follow-up, can you just talk a little bit about some of the big tours that you expect out in '13? I mean, you mentioned a few and you've made a number of announcements. So how does sort of '13 shape up versus sort of '12 on the big, global tours?
Joe Berchtold: So just the first half of the question, you got it right. I mean, I said on Sponsorship, that it would be consistent with the past few years. Last year was 9%. The year before that was 12%. So yes, we are talking double digit without giving you an exact number. And then the other comment was that we expect solid -- or we expect strong growth in the Concert business.
Michael Rapino: Yes, I would say, Doug, the -- given what Joe has indicated already on our on-sales year-to-date and the tickets sold through the pipe, it's always good to be starting the Q1 with the wind at your back. And we think the pipe looks very strong on a global basis for festivals, amps and the touring business. You've -- obviously, I can only talk about the ones that have been announced. But when you have a Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z stadium tour, it's big business. It's also a nice reaffirmation that there is life in young artists to take the spot of the other stadium acts. Beyoncé sold out in seconds. Pink has been phenomenal, selling out around the world and over 60 dates in Australia alone. Rihanna has been up for sale and selling out very, very clean across-the-board on a global basis. Jimmy Buffett went up last week, which was very strong. One D is strong. Maroon 5. So good point is all timing -- sorry, I should mention country, too, which is probably one of our biggest growth areas for '13. We sell a Megaticket, which is a combination of a bunch of artists. We went on sale a few weeks ago with our Megaticket, and we would typically sell that Megaticket, over about 20 million tickets on an annual basis, and we're already past that 20 million-mark. So you got the Jason Aldean, the Luke Bryan stuff, a huge lineup in country. I think when you look at the whole, the nice part is whether it's a One D young act, whether it's a Jimmy Buffett, whether it's a Rihanna pop act or a country artist, and then I'm leaving the festivals aside, which tend to be more electronic and younger, the portfolio looks very diverse and strong in our pocket. So we expect a strong year in the Concert division, and that, obviously, means a strong year in the ticket part of the Concert business also.
Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And just as a follow-up, I mean, you had mentioned in the last call some potential rationalization of the festival business in Europe and particularly, I guess, in Southern Europe. Is that -- are your comments consistent with that occurring as well?
Michael Rapino: Yes. I mean, it's early. I mean, the good news is most of our business in Europe tends to be around our festivals. We're fairly high concentrated in the North. For the South this year, it seems to be holding its own. We're going to the market much smarter this year. We're not taking the risks on a few festivals that we did last year. So I think we'll manage the portfolio of Europe smartly this year and reduce any exposures in the South, whether it turns around or not, and focus on the high-performing, less risky festivals of the North to deliver our total European target.
Operator: And we have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Rapino for closing remarks.
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everybody, for joining, and we will all talk to you after Q1.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

 It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Azzof, Live Nation Entertainment's Chairman of the Board. 
Irving Azoff: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Joining me today are Michael Rapino, our CEO; and Kathy Willard, our CFO. I will begin the call with some brief comments and then turn it over to Michael, who will review our results for the quarter in more detail.
 We continue to deliver improved results without much help from the macroeconomy and are making significant progress towards achieving the goals set following the merger. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was essentially flat, led by strong results from our Ticketing and Sponsorship divisions. In addition to my broader role at Live Nation, I continue to run Artist Nation, including Front Line Management. 
 Touring activity by our key artists during the third quarter was slower than last year, but included Kenny Chesney, Jimmy Buffet, Jason Aldean, Big Time Rush and The Fray. Christina Aguilera and Adam Levine continue their success as judges on The Voice. Mariah Carey has signed on as a judge on American Idol, and Britney Spears has taken the position as judge on X Factor. We continue our program of aggressive new artist signings and securing merchandise and VIP ticketing rights with established stars. The full 2013 touring schedules for key acts are firming up and are currently expected to include both the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac. 
 So thank you again for your support. I look forward to updating you on all our progress during our next earnings call. Now I turn it over to my partner, Michael, for his remarks. 
Michael Rapino: Thank you, Irving. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and continue on plan to deliver revenue, profitability and free cash flow growth across all key segments for 2012 full year. 
 For the third quarter, the company has grown revenue 7% on a constant currency basis, AOI is up 2% and free cash flow increased 23%. Ticket sales through September are up 5% at Ticketmaster and 4% for Live Nation Concerts. I expect the company will complete 2012 with continued growth in ticket sales and market share at both Ticketmaster and Live Nation Concerts, and end 2012 with 2-year growth in revenue close to 15%; AOI, 25% to 30%; and free cash flow, 70% to 75% increase.
 We're growing profitability this year. We also continue to focus on 4 strategic levers. First, we continue to grow our Concert and Ticketing core business, increasing global market share, expanding our portfolio and driving ticket sales. Second, we are making strong progress on our core Ticketing platform to establish the most effective low-cost platform in the industry, while at the same time deploying new products for B2B and B2C to drive incremental revenue. And third, on top of both our Concerts and Ticketing platforms, we continue to grow our sponsorship and online advertising business. 
 As we look at the divisions, let me start with Live Nation Concerts. Live Nation Concerts attendance is up 4% through the third quarter. Over the first 9 months, the U.S. has had a strong growth, with AOI up over 40%, while Europe has underperformed. We now have good visibility into Q4 and North America is again looking very strong, with over 1 million more tickets sold for the quarter than we had last year, led by Madonna and Lady Gaga tours. Although we felt -- I continue to expect solid overall Concert revenue and AOI growth in Q4 and for the full year.
 While the concert business remains strong with new artists coming on the scene every year driving the next generation of Concert fans, this year 6 of the top 10 Live Nation tours in 2012 are artists whose first hit occurred in the 2000s like Lady Gaga and Jason Aldean. And early on sales for 2013 shows are encouraging, with 3 million tickets already sold versus 900,000 the same time last year. 
 Our strategy going forward for continued growth in our Concert platform is by constituting on 4 growth priorities. The first priority is Europe. We will tighten down on our portfolio, canceling festivals that don't have an attractive return over the next few years, along with reducing cost. And therefore, we expect a bounce back in profitability next year. 
 Our second priority is to continue to evolve and expand our portfolio into high-margin opportunities, including festivals, electric dance music and emerging markets and look to exit low-growth areas.
 Our third priority is shifting our marketing spend to social online to drive sales and lower marketing cost. Almost 60% of fans today are sharing their concert experience. While Live Nation has been recognized as the leader in social marketing, I believe we can do much better. In 2012, we only spent 20% of our $125 million in marketing on social online media. And I want to double that in 2013, with the aim to harness profound passion for concerts and leveraging the millions of connected fans to drive awareness.
 Our fourth priority is to continue our channel shift to mobile where economics remain constant but fan engagement is much higher than online. In October, we had 9% of concert ticket purchases made via mobile, up 50% from the first quarter this year. And in a few cases, such as Paul McCartney presale in Canada, we've had higher mobile ticket sales than online.
 Next, Ticketmaster. Through September, global ticket sales are up 5%. October continued this trend with ticket volume up 8% for the month. In the first 9 months of 2012 versus '11, revenue was up 4% and AOI up 6%. Our global net retention rate is over 100% so far this year, and expect this to continue through the full year. 
 Our growth strategy in Ticketing includes 3 growth priorities. Number one is to continue on track to complete our Ticketmaster platform upgrade. The project is now 40% complete, with about $50 million spent to date and running on time and on budget. Starting last month, we rolled out our first set of new products to Ticketmaster venue clients. These products will help the venue simplify workflows, reduce cost and gain further insights into the concert -- customer. And from Ticketmaster perspective, these products will enable us to start reducing costs in 2013 and deliver a return on these investments.
 Our second priority is growing our secondary market share. This year, we built on our NFL partnership by adding the NBA, UFC, Barclays and Madison Square Garden as content partners for the secondary market. This is resulting in an 11% increase in secondary ticket sales so far this year, and we expect to see continued strong growth as we roll out additional products to improve the experience with fans looking to buy and sell tickets.
 And our third priority, like Live Nation, is mobile. Fans are moving to mobile ticketing effortlessly and with high satisfaction levels. In North America, mobile ticket purchase have accounted for 5% of all ticket purchases, and global mobile ticket sales are up 150% this year to 4.7 million tickets through October.
 So while we have a great early position with almost 5 million downloads of our apps and inclusion in iPhone's Passbook, over the coming year you will see a number of new products deployed to improve the consumer experience in purchasing and managing tickets on their smartphone.
 Now turning to our Sponsorship & Advertising business. For the 9 months year-to-date, revenue was up 6% and AOI was up 7% and 10% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, I continue to expect us to hit double-digit AOI growth on constant currency basis. 
 Our global sales team continues to deliver high renewal rates across our near 800 global brand partners. Overall, our growth in Sponsorship this year has been driven by new on-site ad units at festivals and amphitheaters and expanded online ad units. Going forward, we expect ongoing growth in our advertising platform through higher sellthrough, increased CPMs and adding new mobile advertising units in 2013.
 Overall, 2012 has been a strong year for our core business, more market share expansion and free cash flow growth. This will be the second year of growth and overall delivery of approximately $100 million AOI improvement from 2010. We believe this demonstrates that through improved execution, we can continue to drive profitability from our world -- leading world platform. Our investments in technology will then add further incremental revenue and profitability on top of this core.
 Between these results and progress on investments, I believe we can continue to grow profitability over the next 3 years and add another $150 million in AOI by 2015. 
 I'll now turn it over to Kathy. 
Elizabeth Willard: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. For the 9 months ended September 30, we delivered growth in revenue, AOI, operating income and free cash flow. These results are consistent with our plan, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our full year forecast for growth, with solid operating metrics, while continuing to invest in our business.
 For the third quarter, revenue was $1.96 billion, up 10% compared to 2011. After adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates in the quarter, revenue increased 12% over the prior year. On a reported basis, Concert revenue was up 12%, driven by more events with higher attendance in our North American amphitheaters, the timing of global touring activity and acquisitions. 
 Ticketing revenue was up 4% due to higher ticket sales, increased resell activity and higher fees from the London Olympics. 
 Sponsorship & Advertising revenue was up 11%, driven by festival sponsorships. And Artist Nation revenue was up 5% due to increased VIP ticket package sales and acquisition activity. Adjusted operating income was down slightly for the third quarter at $202 million compared to $204 million last year. 
 Concerts AOI was down 41% compared to last year or $35 million. The majority of this decline is due to timing with some festivals moving to the second quarter as we previously discussed and also a shift of event activity into the fourth quarter. The remainder was driven by some underperformance of a few festivals in Europe. 
 Ticketing AOI increased 51% or $28 million, driven by ticket fees from the Paralympics in London, higher primary and secondary ticket sales along with lower legal expenses this year since we accrued $15 million for a legal settlement in the third quarter of 2011. 
 In Sponsorship & Advertising, AOI was up 12% or $8 million as a result of increased sales from festivals and strategic sponsors.
 Our operating income for the quarter was $105 million, flat compared to last year. And our net income was $58 million in the third quarter compared to $52 million in 2011. This was a $0.03 increase in earnings per share to $0.31. 
 For the 9 months of 2012, revenue was $4.4 billion, up $184 million or 4% over 2011. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7%.
 Concerts revenue increased 5% compared to the prior year on a reported basis, driven by an increase in events, primarily amphitheater shows with higher attendance as well as festivals, along with acquisitions. Ticketing revenue for the 9 months increased 4%, driven by higher primary and resale ticket sales. Sponsorship & Advertising revenue grew by 6% with higher sponsorship activation for key sponsors and activity around festivals. And Artist Nation revenue was up 2% due to increased VIP ticket package sales and acquisition activity.
 Adjusted operating income for the 9 months grew 2% to $397 million compared to $387 million in 2011. Concerts AOI decreased slightly 3% or $2 million, driven by a few festivals in Europe which offset the improved profitability in amphitheaters.
 Ticketing AOI increased 6% or $12 million due to higher ticket sales and the 2011 legal charge, while also making continued investments in the technology platform. And Sponsorship & Advertising AOI was up 7% or $9 million from increased sales related to festivals and amphitheaters, along with higher online advertising.
 For the 9 months, we had operating income of $105 million compared to $85 million last year. This improvement comes from our higher ticket sales and increased Sponsorship & Advertising results, along with a reduction in stock-based compensation expense from the Front Line buyout in 2011 while investing in our Ticketing platform. Our net loss for the 9 months was $4 million compared to a gain of $17 million in 2011, with the decrease driven by the 2011 net benefit related to the Front Line buyout of $27 million.
 As of September 30, we had total cash of $784 million, which included $394 million in Ticketing client cash and $89 million in net Concert future event-related cash. Our free cash was $300 million. 
 For the quarter, free cash flow was $152 million for both 2011 and '12, and for the 9 months was $274 million versus $224 million last year. This increase for the 9 months is primarily due to higher AOI and a cash tax benefit in 2012 driven by the realization of tax benefits from the Front Line buyout.
 The free cash flow generated in the first 9 months of $274 million was used to fund revenue-generating capital expenditures of $46 million, including the Ticketing replatforming; $86 million in acquisitions of businesses and other rights; and to fund working capital on the 9 months, our seasonally high point of the year. Based on our current view of the acquired businesses for next year, we believe that they will generate a cash-on-cash return of 20% plus.
 We continue to expect that our total capital expenditures for 2012 will be approximately $125 million. We spent $88 million of this in the first 9 months of the year. The increase over last year's $69 million was driven by the cost for the replatforming of our Ticketing system, along with other purchases of technology and venue equipment. Total deferred revenue was $327 million as of September 30, 2012, compared to $274 million as of September 30, 2011.
 This increase was driven by higher Live Nation Concerts ticket sales in 2012, regardless of the event date, which is up over last year by 15% through October. 
 As of September 30, our total current long-term debt, including capital leases, was $1.75 billion, with no outstanding draws in our revolver. For the first 9 months of 2012, we made $26 million in debt repayment. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discounts, is 5.3%.
 During the third quarter, we issued $225 million of 7% senior notes and increased our term loan by $100 million. These borrowings were used to repay the $287 million of 10.75% senior notes and to pay the associated premiums, accrued interest and related fees, leaving cash of $12 million for operations. As a result of this refinancing, we expect to save $11 million in cash interest annually.
 We continue to remain comfortably in compliance with our debt covenant requirements under our credit facility. As of September 30, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was under 4x versus the maximum of 4.5x, and our interest coverage ratio was over 4.4x versus the minimum ratio of 3x. 
 Our business continues to deliver solid results, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our growth expectations for the full year, which currently include: Continuing to build and grow our Concert portfolio, we expect this business to deliver a mid-single-digit increase in attendance and solid growth in AOI for the year; continuing to invest in our Ticketmaster business, we expect overall ticket sales for 2012 to be up in the low to mid-single-digits, with this increased revenue to be partially reinvested in our Ticketmaster technology and mobile and social products; and continued growth in Sponsorship & Advertising, we expect this segment to again deliver double-digit AOI growth in 2012 on a constant currency basis.
 We thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2012 update, and we will now open up the call for questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ben Mogil with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Benjamin Mogil: So Kathy, I think my question is more for you. If we look at your Ticketing segments, even if we exclude the litigation charge from third quarter of last year, the margins were kind of flat year-over-year for 9 months but they were up a lot in the third quarter of '12 just on -- just the quarter alone. Can you walk us through what the Olympics impact is? Is this sort of a license fee that comes at 100% margin or at least the margin on the Olympics higher than the overall consolidated number? I'm trying to understand why the 9-month numbers were kind of flattish but the third quarter numbers were up so much on a margin basis. 
Elizabeth Willard: It is partially driven by the Olympics and the Paralympics, which their recorded ticket fees and basically dropped the bottom line. We did have some cost of fulfillment, but majority of those costs are covered by the initial sales. And then overall, just the increase in overall ticket sales from the primary and the secondary would have some impact on that as well. 
Benjamin Mogil: Can you isolate the Olympics for us? 
Elizabeth Willard: We don't give those kinds of details. 
Benjamin Mogil: Okay. And then sort of -- I think sort of a second question more for Michael on a larger question. At the Liberty Investor Day, you talked about a number of initiatives to give the guidance for the next couple of years or in '15. When you're thinking about the 5 million attendance growth by adding some more festivals and adding more Electronic Dance Music, is that -- can you achieve that organically? Do you need to do acquisitions? Can you talk about the M&A environment particularly in the EDM with Bob Sillerman back in the market and Ron Burkle and a lot of other players sort of looking at that market too? 
Michael Rapino: It's always a mixture. I think we've shown over the last 7, 8 years when we've gone from prior historical event flow and ticket flow that we've been able to do a combination of both. So we have a great platform in place. So as you've seen this year, every time we organically start a festival from scratch, it's incremental tickets. So when you do MIA in Philadelphia from scratch, it's 85,000 new tickets organically. So we've been able to use our platform to launch a lot of festivals around the world, and we continue to -- and we will continue to do that. We're also able to -- in Korea, we walked in organically in Korea, set up an office there and have been able to build a nice business there and add a few hundred thousand in incremental tickets out of the blocks. So we're looking at a lot of other key markets where we think we can enter, some organically, some with a bolt-on. So we would look at the 5 million as a combination of organic and bolt-on via event creation and via small bolt-ons. 
Benjamin Mogil: Are you seeing acquisition multiples start to expand as you see more -- just put a lot of focus on it in this space? Are you seeing stuff going a little bit further? 
Michael Rapino: The market, I know Bob is out there or others, there's always been somebody out there. So we haven't seen any difference in the marketplace as we've seen over the years. If you got a great festival and you've got a strong position in the market, you probably can get a couple of people bidding. But we haven't seen anything dramatically change in terms of multiple expansions when we're looking at options. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. 
John Healy: Michael, I wanted to ask you a little bit about Europe. And if I think about kind of where you guys have been and where you’re at today, 2010 was obviously a tough year for North America. When you kind of size what happened in Europe, obviously, it's a lot more economic-related than strategy, but how much was did you think the impact on AOI for the Concerts division in Europe this year? And is it basically used in the same playbook as you did in 2011, kind of to recalibrate the strategy for Europe? And how confident do you feel that you can get that piece of the business on, I don't know, breakeven or profitable level next year? 
Michael Rapino: Yes, you said it best. I think we've seen the exact same playbook play out over there as we did here. And as we've shown you 2 years in a row, we can self-adjust the model and return to what we have in North America. We don't think it's prevalent across all of Europe as we've seen in kind of the -- in 2010 U.S. pullback. But we definitely, in Southern Europe, Spain, Italy, some of the obvious markets, we're tougher coming into August than any other year. So we think we have room in the model. We think 2 things happened that the market tends to self adjust itself because as I've said in prior years, the artist has the greatest motivation to make sure the house is full. So it usually starts with ticket pricing and making sure that everyone is pricing the house for maximum sellthrough next year. So I think you're going to see a lot of those conversations going on for next year about what should the ticket price be. And that's what happened with the catalyst to change in '11. So I think we can self-regulate by adjusting the ticket prices to make sure we can match the market economics. We've got -- the good news about our European business is we have over 54 festivals and the vast majority of them are established and very profitable. We'll probably -- into '13, we usually try to start 5 or 6 organic festivals a year in that marketplace, which tend to be an investment strategy and you hope that 50% of them end up being winners long run. So you'll see in '13, we just won't take any of those risks. We'll let the market settle down. We'll cut back on our risky organic strategy. We'll cut some costs, and we'll make sure that we get the pricing of the product right across the portfolio. We think we get that playbook in place there. We'll start to see the market come back by next year. 
John Healy: And maybe, Kathy, I mean, are you able to isolate kind of what the headwind has been in Europe, maybe on the Concerts division profits this year? 
Elizabeth Willard: Yes. I mean, obviously, we track that, John, but we don't usually give that kind of details out. 
John Healy: Okay, fair enough. And then, Michael, I want to ask another kind of bigger picture question. You've been often open and direct in kind of putting out the 2015 goal of $150 million in incremental AOI. When I think about your 4 main divisions, is there a way you could roughly kind of break down where you see that $150 million coming through at? I know you talked a lot about Sponsorship and the reworking at the Ticketing business, but I was trying to think about where that $150 million might be slotted out, hypothetically, over the next couple of years? 
Michael Rapino: Well, we're not going to go through the detail today, but we'll start to get more detailed as we head into '13. I think if you've seen the presentation, we kind of isolated those drivers at the end. I'll start backwards to front. Obviously, Ticketmaster, where we're spending the investment on our platform, the higher-margin business we think is obviously the largest contributor from 2 functions. One, we can just run a very efficient business when that new platform is in place so that per ticket savings just hits the bottom line directly, so that's a big AOI pickup. And we're very bold on as we roll out our new B2B products online and mobile, we're going to tick up that secondary business and take a good bite out of that business and drop back to our bottom line.
 So the biggest spend in our business right now priority-wise has been around Ticketing, and we would look at that as being those 2 initiatives as being the larger part of the $150 million. Then you add on 2 components, Sponsorship being next because the more tickets we have, the more robust our platform is, the easier it is for my sales guys to sellthrough online and customize programs. So that we expect to continue to grow at higher rates as we improve our technology platform. And then the fourth, being the final, is the smaller of the 4, would be the increased ticket volume across our platform of Concerts. Now as you know, Concerts end up being the engine to the train. The more tickets, the more concerts we do, the better Ticketmaster does in terms of renewals and the higher sponsorships we do because of the flow-through. So we think the Ticketing is the absolute priority to our business, both from an investment and a return perspective. 
John Healy: Okay. And then just one final question. I think in the Q you guys filed tonight, there's a brief mention to the CTS update. It sounds like you're expecting some sort of update by the end of the year. Is there a way you can provide us with maybe a little bit more clarity in terms of how you're feeling, maybe where you're positioned and thoughts regarding that outcome? 
Michael Rapino: Yes, we sure hope and believe this is the final extension. We're pretty confident now that the judge will deliver the verdict by the end of the year. We are still confident in our position. We've had many discussions, and we think that we're still going to have a verdict that is in our favor or we would have probably looked at other options by now, but we believe seeing through the process is the best option for shareholders. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Evercore. 
Douglas Arthur: Kathy, 2 questions for you. On the Concert costs, the Q says that adjusted for FX, so if I had this right, costs were up 20% in the quarter year-over-year. You talked about the acquisitions, Coppel, Cream, obviously, you've been buying into Electronic Dance Music, you started some new festivals. So I guess I'm just trying to get a breakdown of kind of how much was organic and how much was due to those other factors? And then on the -- correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like the accounting treatment in Ticketing completely changed this quarter. The number for last year is different. You have a much larger intersegment revenue number all of a sudden and the cost allocation between operating and SG&A look a lot different. So is there -- can you explain that? 
Elizabeth Willard: Sure. So on your first question, we actually do give the breakdown on the acquisition impacting Concerts in the Q as well. So you're asking on DOE, and the acquisition piece of that was about $57 million of the increase. The rest of it is really driven by festival investment, some of the European festivals and then also just timing of how the global tours are working out this year that there'll be some blending between Q3 and Q4 on that. That's really the biggest driver on that. On your Ticketing question, what you're seeing is that the eliminations between activity for Concerts and Ticketing, the elimination was changed where we moved it out of -- it was within Ticketing before. We've now broken that out and we're doing with the eliminations to better show intersegment revenue. So that’s just a fix to how it's presented in the past to make it consistent with this year's presentation to get that Concerts and Ticketing activity reported as cleanly as possible. No change in overall numbers, and that would have just been revenue and direct operating expenses that were impacted. 
Douglas Arthur: Okay. So just -- so it impacts how you allocate cost versus SG&A? 
Elizabeth Willard: No, it impacts how it's reported from a segment standpoint. It's just the sharing of the rebates between Concerts and Ticketing and how that's booked between Ticketing, revenue and Ticketing direct operating expenses versus the elimination company. That's why the total numbers don't change at all. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from John Tinker with Maxim. 
John Tinker: Could you just talk a little bit more about the mobile side? I think you mentioned it was about 5% of all ticket sales. Is that -- is there any difference in the margin as that becomes bigger? Or how does sort of the cost of that compare with the existing structure? And secondly, just if you could touch on how many tickets do you think that StubHub gets from you as people sort of go on your site on Ticketmaster and buy tickets and then resell via StubHub? 
Michael Rapino: So I'll start with the first question on mobile. We've -- in general, the nice part about our mobile strategy versus maybe other companies that are struggling in terms of how to transfer to that channel, our economic strengths were 100%. So whether the face value or the service fee, it's the exact same price at mobile or online. So that's the good news because as you know, others are having difficulty figuring that one out. Our ticket is obviously -- this is a product that's made for mobile phones, meaning a consumer doesn't need a lot of descriptions or pictures to figure out if they want to buy that ticket. So we're seeing huge interest, and we'll continue to move to mobile. So the economics and the revenue stay the same. Economics on the cost generally stay the same for now. I envision the asset when we're talking, 3, 4 years from now, when a higher majority percent of the tickets are on mobile, we'll probably be able to realize some efficiencies as we move to a mobile platform versus an online or as we pick up any of those remaining retailer phone sales that people will start to gravitate to a mobile phone. So I think long term, it's a cost-benefit to our business if you're all -- if the high majority of our tickets are sold on mobile. As far as the second, on StubHub, we don't disclose or track that specifically. Generally, you could say that probably most of our tickets, if they are good ticket, end up in a secondary market. So probably a high, high majority of our sports and music shows that are first sold at Ticketmaster end up somewhere on a secondary site, which is why we think we have an incredible opportunity to add some value at that juncture. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company. 
Richard Tullo: My first question is, I was just a little bit late to the call, I mean, owing to a connectivity issue, was there a -- do you expect a headwind in the fourth quarter owing to the Storm Sandy? 
Michael Rapino: No, we're lucky. We've -- thankfully, as I said somewhere in the quote, thankfully, it was the fall on a Monday and Tuesday or midweek. We had a big weekend, the weekend before which was successful, obviously. But in general, if you look across Ticketmaster, Live Nation canceled shows obviously, a vast majority of those end up getting rescheduled. So you pick that back up at some point. But in general, we've been lucky in overall cost cancelation, insurance, et cetera, as maybe a few hundred thousand dollars to our bottom line but nothing significant. 
Richard Tullo: Where do you stand with the NHL lockout? Is that going to be a drag or a net benefit to Live Nation owing to increased arena availability? 
Michael Rapino: Yes, I mean, it's a -- right now, it's a Ticketmaster business issue, not so much of a Concert division. We've obviously -- it would be like -- I would like to be selling NHL tickets. But as of right now, if the -- let's just call that if the business doesn't happen by the end of the year, Ticketmaster total impact is probably a couple of million dollars. We don't see right now any dramatic pick up in events tapping in those dates. I guess if the year was up completely declared over, you'd start to see it. But I think the NHL Arena owners are still on a standby basis. So there's not much opportunity to book new shows in right now. 
Richard Tullo: And last question on Sponsorship. Was there any drag on -- in that business owing to Europe or any of the other factors? And what do you think needs to occur to get revenue going in the right direction with Sponsorship? 
Michael Rapino: Well, listen, Sponsorship is by far one of our most profitable, highest-margin and consistently growing bottom line businesses over the last few years. We've been growing AOI at double-digit growth for years. So we think that that business will continue to have great runway. We're continuing to find better ad units within our platform. We've had a great new business by online, and we think mobile is a whole new opportunity for us. So we continue to be very bullish with Sponsorship advertising. It will continue to be a growth business for us. We actually, in Europe, did not see the effect of a slowdown. We saw it, obviously, on the Concert ticket side but we did not see it in the Sponsorship side to date. So we will finish 2012 in Europe Sponsorship fairly unscathed by the European slowdown. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And Mr. Rapino, there's no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you. 
Michael Rapino: All right. Thank you, everybody, and we look forward to our Q1 conference call. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Live Nation Entertainment Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-08-07 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Carrie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 
 Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements relating to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation for the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release. The release, reconciliations and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found on www.livenation.com/investors. 
 It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Azoff, Live Nation Entertainment's Chairman of the Board. 
Irving Azoff: We welcome everyone to our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Michael Rapino, our CEO and Kathy Willard, our CFO. I will begin the call with some brief comments and then turn it over to Michael, who will review our results for the quarter in more detail. 
 We continue to deliver improved results without much help from the macro economy, and are making significant progress towards achieving the goals set following the merger. Adjusted operating income for the quarter increased by 5% over last year on essentially flat revenues, led by strong results from our concert division. In addition to my broader role at Live Nation Entertainment, I continue to lead Artist Nation, including Front Line Management. Touring activity by our key artists during the second quarter was slower than last year, but did include Van Halen, Jimmy Buffet and Jason Aldean. Summer tours commenced late June, July include: Kenny Chesney, Neil Diamond, Big Time Rush and The Fray. Summer touring for many of our artists currently looks good. This is currently expected to be lower than 2011, however. Christina Aguilera and Adam Levine continue with their success as judges on The Voice, and Mariah Carey has signed on as a judge on American Idol. We continue our program of aggressive new artist signings and securing merchandise and VIP ticketing rights with established stars in the new tween band, One Direction, which is performing exceptionally well. Full 2013 touring schedules for key acts are firming up and are currently expected to include the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac. 
 So thank you again for your support, and I look forward to updating you on the progress during our next earnings call. I'd like now to turn it over to Michael for his remarks. 
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon, and welcome to our conference call. This quarter, we continue to deliver positive results across revenue, AOI and free cash flow. Revenue increased 2% on a constant currency basis. AOI grew 5% and free cash flew -- flow grew 27%. Our core businesses have remained strong, not only in North America, but also internationally. Ticket sales grew this quarter 6% in both Ticketmaster and Live Nation and for the full 6 months, Ticketmaster sales grew 6% and Live Nation, up 5%. These strong sales validate the strength of the live event, which remains a high priority for discretionary spending with our fans. I have heard varying comments from the impact of the economy from other companies over the past few weeks. For us, the only markets with any noticeable impact was Spain and Italy. Both these markets together made up only 3% of our overall concert division sales and overall concert attendance between the 2 markets are expected to be flat for the year. On the ticketing side, Spain accounts for about 8% of sales and here again, we expect the business to be roughly flat for the year. 
 As we continue to improve operating profitability across the core, we are investing in 3 key areas: Ticketmaster re-platform project, which continues on schedule and on budget; mobile expansion and continued concert portfolio expansion, which drives all contents to all divisions. With greater visibility now for the full year, we expect to deliver growth across revenue, AOI and free cash flow for the full year. As we look at the divisions, Live Nation concerts had a great second quarter. We now see strong growth in both attendance and profitability for the season. For the quarter, AOI grew 83%. Total attendance for the quarter grew 6%, which compares to 5% for concerts as an overall category of Ticketmaster, indicating that we are continuing to build share. North American concert attendance for the quarter grew 5% and international was up 9%. Average attendance per show grew 7% during the second quarter, demonstrating potential upside as we continue to execute on maximizing the core and driving incremental sales. 
 Our improvements this year in AOI have been driven by our festival and amp business, the 2 highest margin channels in our portfolio. Starting with festivals, in the second quarter, we held 21 festivals across Europe and North America, with total attendance of 1.1 million fans, an increase of 53% over last year. North America, we continued building our festival base, adding River's Edge in St. Paul, I love San Francisco, Watershed at The Gorge, Hard Summer in L.A. and Made in America in Philadelphia. We currently expect festival tickets in North America to more than double compared to last year. In Europe, we launched Bluesfest in London, Rock Im Park in Poland, metal fest in Italy, IMPACT in Poland and Stockholm Music & Arts in Sweden. Across the entire global festival portfolio this year, we plan on producing 57 festivals, with expected ticket sales growth of over 25% compared to last year. 
 Turning to amphitheaters, attendance was up 53% while delivering 8% increase in attendance per show in the second quarter compared to last year. Our business has benefited from 3 initiatives we focused on this year. One, a greater variety of acts geared towards the next generation of amphitheater attendees, specifically teenagers; second, improvement in the overall amp experience with changes in higher quality food and value-priced beer; and finally, deploying dynamic and platinum pricing to capture more of the value of our shows. In the second quarter, we had over 60 shows through dynamic pricing and over 100 platinum ticket packages and, combined, we are seeing an 8% to 10% increase in contribution margin on these shows. Electronic music has been the priority for us of this year. It represents a big growth opportunity to drive incremental attendance to our portfolio. Our EDM attendance has nearly tripled to 160,000 in the second quarter and for the 6 months total was 260,000. So far through July, including festivals, we have produced 124 electronic events around the world compared to 52 at this point last year. Across all the electronic activity, I expect a 24% increase in 2012.
 The number one priority in concerts is ensuring we have a strong and diverse lineup of acts and our second priority is to drive incremental ticket sales. Mobile is a natural channel to sell transfer share and further engage with fans and drive higher conversion. We continue to expand our mobile presence with the launch of our Android app and the introduction of our summer mobile promotion. Through July, we have sold 1 million mobile concert tickets through our apps in the mobile version of livenation.com, a 300% increase from last year. Looking at these accomplishments individually and in total, I'm very pleased with the progress we have made in the concerts division and expect another year of growth. 
 For Ticketmaster, we continue to grow ticket sales this quarter, while investing in technology for the future. For the quarter, revenue grew 2% and AOI was down 5%. AOI was down on a year-on-year basis due to investments in technology and the fact that last second quarter, we had the exceptional one-time London Olympics on sales as a comparable. Our 2012 focus continues to grow ticket sales in primary and secondary, while investing in our platform to achieve further operating efficiencies, while providing a modern platform to unlock growth opportunities that our scale provides. 
 In the second quarter, we made great progress on each of these areas. Global ticket sales for the first 6 months were up 6%, while North America up 4% and international up 9%. We again achieved a net retention rate of over 100% globally with our venue clients in the quarter and expect us to maintain this for the full year. In addition, our secondary business has delivered 15% growth in ticket sales through July, driven by rapid adoption of ticket authentication and delivery, which allows us to ensure the fan purchases a valid ticket. We have seen a 44% increase in conversion for the 6 months through June for venues that have activated AVD. We also continue to see strong growth with our existing content partners. We doubled sales with the LA Lakers, MSG and the NFL Exchange over last year. This growth is primarily the result of increased conversion driven by AVD. 
 We are on plan with our Ticketmaster platform project. This quarter, we began the first phase of rolling out new business-to-business products. We've launched a new business software that reduces training for box office personnel from days to hours and it's already use in over 300 clients, or about 15% of our client base. We also deployed an event management product that enable the venues to set up their own events. As of June, in North America, more than 80% of ticket clients are using this tool, reducing demand on customer service group and improving customer satisfaction. These tools represent the first pieces of the re-platform that will enhance our products for venue clients and significantly reduce cost per ticket. Like Live Nation, Ticketmaster will continue to extend its business into mobile. So far this year in mobile, we have launched 2 iPhone and 2 Android apps for Ticketmaster. Of these new releases, 3 were in the U.S. and Canada and 1 in the U.K. We have nearly 3.5 million downloads globally of our apps through July and we expect this number to reach more than 5 million by the end of the year. 
 Mobile has been our fastest-growing channel with global ticket sales to July of 3 million, a 300% increase over last year. Looking forward, mobile will continue to be a key focus this year. We expect to roll out 7 more apps, including Android, apps in Ireland, Australia and New Zealand and Android in the U.K. We plan to roll out an upgraded mobile site for the U.K. at the end of August and to increase mobile features for fans such as ticket bar codes to be used in a mobile device for venue entry. Looking at the ticket business in total, it remains on track to deliver slight growth in overall ticket sales for the year, with great upside as we unlock future opportunities across our 200 million fan base with technology improvements.
 Turning to Sponsorship. For the quarter, revenue and AOI in our Sponsorship & Advertising divisions were both flat on a constant currency basis and down 3% in actuals. Through the year, I still expect us to deliver double digit AOI growth on a constant currency basis. In North America, we had 2 important new sponsors during the quarter, Samsung Mobile U.S.A. celebrated by rewarding its fans a surprise concert that was streamed on Facebook. The event generated over 487 million impressions. And Live Nation is engaged with Kelloggs to drive their teen summer program, Crazy Good Summer. Internationally, festivals continue to drive new sponsors to our portfolio. Intel recently signed up and is utilizing an integrated campaign with our festivals and HP hosted acoustic sets at our Wireless Festival in London. 
 Our online advertising business continues to grow. For the 6 months through June, online advertising revenue is up 8%. In North America, we have added a number of new national advertisers to our livenation.com and ticketmaster.com advertising portfolio, including MetLife, Pizza Hut, Toyota Prius, Supercuts and MetroPCS and internationally, we have brought ad sales online for 11 additional countries so far this year. My confidence in achieving full year AOI growth comes from a few sources. Number one, in July, we have booked 7% more committed sponsors than we had last time this year and second, we have additional inventory planned for the back half of the year. We're expanding our ad units on-site with upgraded videos screens, branded viewing decks and tech lounges. We're leveraging our growing portfolio, mobile apps, to increase our mobile advertising sales, and we're deploying a rich media content units at livenation.com, which we think will drive higher CPMs and increase online sales. 
 In summary, our second quarter was very successful and demonstrates the continued progress we have made in each of our businesses over the past year. For the full year, I currently believe we will deliver the growth and revenue AOI and cash flow that we have planned, and from that, I will continue to see a strong run rate to build on future growth. Kathy, I will turn it over to you now. 
Elizabeth Willard: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon everyone. For the first 6 months, we have delivered growth in revenue, AOI, operating income and free cash flow and we are pleased with these results for the first half of 2012. Concert ticket sales are up, driving a strong increase in deferred revenue. Our business is solid, enabling the company to deliver on our key operating metrics, while continuing to make necessary investments to drive our future growth. 
 For the second quarter, revenue was $1.55 billion, essentially flat compared to 2011. However, after adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates in the quarter, revenue actually increased by 2%. On a reported basis, our concert segment revenue was also essentially flat. Global concert's attendance was up 6%, driven by higher show count at our amphitheaters. The concerts revenue was also negatively impacted by foreign currency changes and the timing of global tours in the quarter. Ticketing revenue was up 2% due to strength in global ticket sales, which grew 6%, fueled by concerts and sporting events. Artist Nation revenue was down 8% from lower merchandise sales, while Sponsorship & Advertising is in line with last year. 
 Adjusted operating income increased 5% for the second quarter to $146 million compared to last year's $139 million. The concerts division delivered this growth, up year-over-year by 83% due to more shares and higher attendance in our amphitheaters and strong global festival result, even as we continue to invest in building our portfolio, both organically and via acquisition. Ticketing AOI decreased 5% or $4 million, as our profitability was impacted by our continued investment in the ticketing platform, along with the higher sales of the Olympics tickets in 2011. Sponsorship & Advertising AOI was down $1 million, largely as a result of the timing of Europe festivals with related sponsorships. Our operating income for the quarter was $43 million, down from $52 million in the prior year, driven by higher amortization expense in our concert business. And our net income for the quarter was $8 million compared to $13 million in 2011, with the decrease coming from our lower operating income. 
 For the first 6 months of 2012, revenues were $2.4 billion, up $10 million over 2011 and on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3%. Concerts revenue increased 2% on constant currency basis without the negative currency impact of $39 million. On a reported basis, concerts revenue was essentially flat to last year in the first half. As Michael noted, our amphitheater season is off to a strong start with increased attendance in higher average attendance per show. Our ancillary net revenue per attendee in the amps is currently down slightly by 3% as compared to last year. During the second quarter, we had several tours that attracts younger audience, which typically have lower spend per head. We currently expect that for the full year, our spend per head will be in line with last year. Ticketing revenue for the 6 months increased 2%, driven by higher ticket volumes in the U.S. and in Europe. Sponsorship & Advertising grew by 1% driven by higher online advertising, and Artist Nation was down by $2 million or 1%, due to lower merchandise sales. As noted, we experienced a 3% negative impact of revenue in the first 6 months from currency headwinds. Based on current forward rates, we expect similar negative impact for the second half of 2012. Adjusted operating income for the 6 months grew 6% to $194 million compared to $184 million in 2011. This growth comes from the overall improvements in concerts, which delivered an increase of $33 million in AOI, driven by growth in the amphitheaters and strong festival activity. 
 Ticketing AOI is down 10%. Their improved sales and operating performance was offset by the investments in technology we're making, as well as the impact of the higher ticket sales for the Olympics in 2011. Sponsorship & Advertising is up 2% driven by higher online sales in North American festival sponsorship. The overall increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $9 million for the first half of 2012 is driven by higher cost in ticketing for the replatforming project. For the full year, we currently continue to expect that ticketing overall fixed cost will be up approximately $10 million for the full year. Corporate costs are higher by $5 million, driven by increased corporate-related non-cash comp expense, as well as legal cost on the live concert antitrust litigation, which we have now successfully concluded after 10 years with no material impact to our financials. 
 For the 6 months, we had operating income of $165,000 compared to a loss of $20 million last year. This improvement comes from our higher AOI and a reduction of $24 million in stock-based compensation from the frontline buyout in 2011, partially offset by a slight increase in amortization expense this year. Our net loss for the 6 months was $61 million compared to a loss of $35 million in 2011, with the decrease driven by tax benefit realized in '11 at $40 million related to the Front Line buyout. 
 For the quarter, free cash flow was $100 million compared to $78 million last year and for the 6 months was $123 million versus $71 million last year. This increase was driven by our higher AOI and lower cash taxes due to tax refunds received in 2012. As of June 30, we had total cash of $1 billion, which included $393 million in ticketing client cash and $314 million in concert event related cash. Our free cash, or available cash, was $213 million. For the 6 months, we had generated $310 million in cash flow from operations compared to $133 million in the prior year for the same period. The main difference between cash flow from operations and free cash flow are working capital changes, which were a $191 million source of cash in the first half of 2012, driven by an increase in event-related deferred revenue, less prepaid show cost, as a result of a higher ticket sales in our concert segment. We also had higher receivable collections from tax receivables and timing of other items. Our working capital requirements are driven primarily by the timing of tickets sales for future events and payments to artists and venues. We don't recognize revenue and cost for events until the show occurs. 
 Total deferred revenue was $830 million as of June 30, 2012, compared to $641 million in June 2011, an increase of almost $200 million. This increase was driven by higher Live Nation concert ticket sales in 2012, regardless of the event date that we have seen through July, which are currently up 15%. Through July, on the Ticketmaster site, we've seen total ticket sales, regardless of event date, increase by 5%, with North America up 4% and international up 9%. We currently continue to expect that our total capital expenditures for 2012 will be approximately $125 million. For the first 6 months, we have spent $59 million. The increase over last year's $45 million was driven by the cost for the redesign of the Ticketmaster technology platform, along with other technology and the new equipment cost. 
 As of June 30, our total current and long-term debt, including capital leases, was $1.74 billion with no outstanding draws on our revolver. We made $7 million in net debt repayments in the quarter. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discounts and premiums, is 6%. We continue to remain comfortable in compliance with our debt covenant requirements under our credit facility. As of June 30, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was under 4x versus the maximum 4.5x, and our interest coverage ratio was over 4.4x versus the minimum ratio of 2.75.
 Our business is solid and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our growth expectations for the year. Our key expectations for the full year 2012 are to continue to build and grow our concert portfolio. We currently expect this business to deliver a high single digit increase in attendance and solid growth in AOI. We continue growing our Sponsorship & Advertising network, and we expect this segment to maintain its momentum and deliver low double digit AOI growth in 2012 on a constant currency basis, and we will continue to invest in our Ticketmaster business. We expect overall ticket sales to be slightly up in 2012, but this will be substantially offset by our investments in the Ticketmaster technology re-platforming and mobile and social product. We thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2012 update, and we will now open up the call for questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from David Joyce with ISI Group. 
David Joyce: Appreciate that the second quarter concerts AOI was up based on the incremental festivals, but I was wondering if you could quantify any of the benefits you've had from the dynamic pricing that you've started rolling out? 
Michael Rapino: Well, as I said, David, on my script here, without getting precise because of competitive reasons, you can appreciate, as I said, that the key is the adoption rate. So I think, last year, I spoke about build the tool that we could get adopted throughout the business. We think we have a great simple dynamic pricing product now that agents and managers in the industry can use. We've got -- we spent the year selling it in over 100 artists participating or shows, if you want to call it, against either dynamic pricing or a platinum scaling. Either version is about secure some of the high revenue that ends up on the scalpers column and put it into the P&L of the artist and the promoter. So as I've alluded to here, we've got -- when activated and an artist or a show is using the dynamic pricing tool and/or platinum, increasing some of the scaling or thinking about a few different ways to scale the house, based on from factual input, we're getting an 8% to 10% increase in that show's contribution. So early success the first year we've started to roll it out, and as I promised, the Street was about getting some adoption, learned some lessons and get some successes built, and we're very happy right now that we have close to 100 participating, and our goal by the end of the year is if you got 100 artists and agents and managers participating and all having an increased revenue output for that show, that will be a great way to pave the future to higher adoption. 
David Joyce: And if I may, on another front, some of your peers and competitors seem to have some potential to stream concerts on cable networks, such as AAG and Access TV, Madison Square Garden, like are you able to do that with Fuse for example? Do you have right -- do you participate in rights for the streaming with your artists or with your promotions or do you foresee anything more tangible that you might do with the cable network partnership? 
Michael Rapino: Well, in general, the ownership of that live show is owned somewhere between that artist and the record label. The rights to stream a show are a lot easier to obtain than obviously the rights to download and buy a show. So we do somewhere around 300 to 400 shows a year where we would be filming them, recording them or steaming them, whether they're for sponsors, whether they're at livenation.com or whether they are at -- we stream the entire iTunes Music Festival in partnership with some at iTunes. So we have a Live Nation studio division that's been at it for a while. We have found the easiest way to monetize that live show to date has been to build a division that can service sponsors. So most sponsors have websites and Facebook pages and desire for live streams and content. So we've been delivering direct to sponsors as a way to build our sponsorship base to date, but we have definitely been stepping up this year and you will see us more aggressive in the fall at livenation.com, as we launch that website coming into the fall into a much more interactive website that we'll definitely have a higher level of live streams shows and live concert interaction. We would think that the best model for us is to build our current online business as the main vehicle supported by our sponsorship strategy then start to venture into the cable right now. 
Operator: And we'll take your next question from Doug Arthur with Evercore. 
Douglas Arthur: Yes 2 questions, kind of back to concert margins for a second. I mean this is the fourth quarter in a row where revenues have exceeded costs, i.e., costs have gone down at a pretty good clip. So is it -- do you feel you've reached sort of an inflection point in terms of all the initiatives, dynamic pricing, better scheduling in this division and can that sustain itself in a big seasonal third quarter? And then secondly, on the Sponsorship & Advertising, I mean, is this timing going to be sort of a fact of life in this division, where you have some big quarters and some flat quarters because it seems like as the -- you gain more critical mass, there's just been more kind of not randomness, but kind of the quarterly numbers have jumped around a lot. 
Michael Rapino: Well, I'll take a stab at a bit of that. I'll start from the back forward. I mean, as you know, other than the natural reality of quarters for Wall Street, we play for the year. It tends to be in the world of concert touring, it's a January December kind of season. So obviously, in our business, the second and third quarter mean in the summers both internationally and festivals. Amphitheaters tend to be the highest -- obviously, the highest activity globally for the artist. So somewhere between the second and third quarter, depending on what day that cuts off and what shows we're having, you can have a swing. So definitely, there are chances that sometimes, the Madonna tours in the second quarter in 1 year, U2s in the third quarter, so you have some swing. Generally, why you continually hear us talk about full year is we're less worried about whether the show happens in June or July and more worried about during the year. In totality, do we have the line-up and the show count to deliver the growth, so definitely, a business where you have continual movement between Q2 and Q3. In the odd time, you get a big Q1 Roger Waters world tour that launches in the wintertime that can take your numbers on a year-over-year basis, but totality, over the year is what we play for to kind of smooth out the reality when certain things happen. Concert division, you're right. We were very proud that we, over the last couple of years, are running the business a lot better than we had previously. We've got a great team both in international and in North America. We're buying better, but a lot of the focus has been on the execution. When you have 25,000 shows a year, if you can upgrade that marketing capability and start to claw into that little fact that we live with here that 40% of consumers didn't know about the show or they would have went, and 60% of your shows aren't sold-out. So if every of those 25,000 shows, we sold 10 more tickets to every one of those shows, that's a nice drop to the bottom line. So why you hear us talk about mobile and social and engagement is we do believe that the social platform and the mobile platforms, it is made for the concert business in terms of people want to buy a ticket online on their mobile phone, and they want to share all of their fun activity around the concert in a social environment, and the more people that spread and post to Facebook and tell their friends, incremental sales are coming to life. So we think we've got great run rate to drive that number. I talked about attendance per show up. That's the foundation to driving our bottom line. We'll probably always have somewhere in the 25,000-plus shows. We'll grow those if we grow some markets, but the upside in our bottom line will continually be if we can continue to build strong marketing department that can sell incremental tickets to those 25,000 shows, and that's been the focus for 18 months and definitely coming to life this year, and we think we've got great runway ahead of us to -- even if you took 40% of consumers who didn't know about a show to 35%, that 5% that hit our bottom line, would change the dynamics of our business, and we think mobile and social are incredible tools to help drive that. 
Douglas Arthur: That's great and Kathy, just a quick follow-up on the concert division, was there -- can you explain the one-time item in D&A in the concert division? 
Elizabeth Willard: There was impairment of about $14 million in the quarter related to some of the intangibles, but timing wise, it's really a timing issue because it's coming off one way or the other. The impact for the full year is going to be about $9 million. 
Operator: And we'll take your next question from Martin Pyykkonen. 
Martin Pyykkonen: A couple of questions on the AOI margin for the concert segment kind of going forward into onto next year, is there a sort of normalized or peak level that you can obtain relative to cost and the dynamic pricing initiatives you've had? And then a clarification, Kathy said something about 3 points of FX impact, was that specific to the concerts segment or was that overall? And if it was overall, do you have that broken out for concert revenues, specifically? 
Elizabeth Willard: Yes, I'll answer that, the second question first. The FX impact, the 3%, for the full company. We do -- the concert piece of it alone was about 2%. So it is obviously the biggest piece of our revenue and does drive all sorts of things. 
Michael Rapino: And as far as the margin, we wouldn't give you a guidance on that, but I think the tone is the important part. We believe, obviously, with our scale and concerts and ticketing and our kind of leadership market position, overall, our #1 goal is obviously to drive higher free cash flow from the existing business and ultimately delever our balance sheet over time as we build that stockpile. The way we're going to get there is less about more revenue and definitely about driving higher margins from our existing business. So without giving you the guidance on the numbers, yes, the thematic here is how do we drive higher margins from those existing 200 million-plus consumers that are transacting with our core business, and obviously then that drives down to the cash flow bottom line. So we think there's opportunity to increase the margin. Now it's tough because of the revenue mix in our business when you drive big revenue tours like Madonna and you're driving $5 billion or $6 billion in that revenue mix. Mathematically, it's tough to make a substantial difference in the bottom line margin. But generally, the thematic on how we're going to execute here has been over last year and continues to drive higher margin from existing business. 
Martin Pyykkonen: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on the fall winter, deep fall winter, as you said, it's a full year, the way you look at it, that's obviously the less seasonal part. Qualitatively, at this point in terms of those that are touring that you know the number of shows kind of planned, just what's the general outlook for year-over-year that's coming fall winter versus the previous? 
Michael Rapino: You're right, we would, at this point in the year, we know 2 things that matter. We know how strong Q3 is going to close generally, because, obviously, all those shows are all well booked and on sale, and now it's just a matter of how they close. So that would be the biggest determination to how the overall year will play out. And then after that is what does your show count look like from both the ticketing and a concert perspective for Q4? Now Q4 is always light, so you're never going to make a substantial change in Q4. You're not going to gain a lot of bottom line in Q4. You just don't want to give a lot -- you don't want to give away a lot. And at this point, I would say that Q3 is looking very strong and Q4 is looking on par with history. So I don't think we'll be giving away much in Q4. It should be flat year-over-year as we look at the rest of the lineup. So we believe that's kind of the basics on how we could sit here today and call the year in terms of we believe it's a strong revenue AOI and cash flow growth year-over-year. If we close everything in Q3 like we hoped and all the PVDs come to life in Q4, those too look on course, right now, to deliver our growth. 
Operator: And we'll take your next question from Ben Mogil with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Benjamin Mogil: Kathy or Michael, I don't know if you -- I don't think you did this call in the past. You kind of given a sort of a current quarter update on ticketing trends. Can you give us anything along those lines? 
Elizabeth Willard: Yes, Ben, we did say that so kind of this is when we're looking at ticket sales during the year, regardless of the event date. And through July, concert is currently at 15% over last year and Ticketmaster is at 5%, with North America up 4% and international up 9%. 
Benjamin Mogil: And that's -- and so that's just the entire year-to-date. That's not a -- that's not just the current quarter, correct? 
Elizabeth Willard: Right, but that basically shows you -- I mean, that's in line with what we were showing as Ticketmaster tickets for the 6 months and gives you a different view on concerts, but shows you why the deferred revenue is so strong. 
Benjamin Mogil: Okay. And then I think just going back to your comments before on cost on the sponsorship numbers that you look to be, think you'll you'd be sort of up low double digit EBITDA on constant currency, which I guess would kind of be a mid to high single digit on U.S. dollars. Any thoughts about hedging that going forward or is it just not worth it from where you guys sit -- hedging the currency exposure on that? 
Elizabeth Willard: Again, we continued our process of hedging the artist contracts in foreign countries where we're paying in a different currency than ticket sales, and we continue to evaluate the other, but no real claims right now. 
Benjamin Mogil: And lastly, on the CTS arbitration, I saw in the Q that you noted that you expect something in the fall. It's obviously beyond your control. Has the arbitrator gone back to either party for more information or has it really been no change in an update since almost, I guess, the beginning of the year? 
Michael Rapino: No change. No information, just a delay on the arbitrator side to deliver the judgment. So we're now waiting for a fall due date, is the latest, but still feel confident. No changes in our perspective on our defense. 
Operator: And we'll take your next question from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Company. 
Richard Tullo: Did you say that ticket sales, mobile ticket sales, were 1 million for concerts and about 3 million for Ticketmaster, is that correct? 
Michael Rapino: Yes. 
Richard Tullo: And is there a demographic difference from your typical customer from the customer that's acquiring a ticket on mobile? 
Michael Rapino: Yes, in general, we ran a bunch of research around this, but if you simplified it, as you would expect, they are younger, younger and more active buyers. So the first to convert are going to be the obviously high user and younger demo. 
Richard Tullo: And in terms of streaming, does it make sense for Ticketmaster to link up with one of the Internet radio services such Pandoras, Spotify or iHeart, to do sponsorship channels on the air platform? 
Michael Rapino: What we're talking and always evaluating all our options with partners. Remember, let's just call the competitor set we have, nobody has what we have, meaning, the platform and the presence of ticketmaster.com and livenation.com. So our first priority in the way that we monetize 100% of the advertising dollar is to deliver that business to our sponsor in our own platform. And the larger our platform and the higher our traffic at our platform, the more tickets we sell and the higher our sponsorship is. So to date, we believe we will continue to kind of feed our tm and livenation.com businesses, and that's the way we can keep delivering that double-digit sponsorship online advertising growth versus kind of producing and delivering to someone else's advertising platform. 
Richard Tullo: Okay. And one last question in regards to, I guess, concert disruption. The London Olympics going on right now, is that going to be somewhat disruptive in the third quarter? Can we see some shifting of revenues from the third quarter to the fourth quarter? 
Michael Rapino: Not in general. I mean, we -- everybody, obviously, it's a big business over in Europe in general, so it's only really affected in London proper. So there wouldn't be a lot of shows planned over those 2 weeks if you're an artist. But in general, the European concert season or the festival season, which kind of drives the London business, just naturally, it happens to be a May, June and end of August business. So not a big change in these 2 weeks during the Olympics that has changed any of the historic business in London. 
Richard Tullo: One last question, do relative costs to promote a electronics dance music, concert or festival relative to more traditional type of festival, is the -- are the margins on those kind of events a little fatter for you? 
Michael Rapino: Well, I mean, festivals, in general, are one of the highest margin businesses we have. So we like the festival business period, and electronic festival versus a good pop or rock 'n roll festival would be on par to possibly a few points higher on margin. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from John Tinker with Financial Services. 
John Tinker: Actually it's Maxim. This is a follow-up to the festival's higher profitably. I noticed the British company called Music Festivals, which had issued a profit warning a few days ago and it's looking to raise capital. Is that company specific or you think there could be a turn in the festivals business as people start to overbid to get the talent? 
Michael Rapino: Yes, that company you're referring to has been down that path a couple of times. So if you're in the business of owning one festival in the U.K, you're fairly exposed on that one event. Then you have a portfolio of 57 -- it's a portfolio that really kind of hedges the risk. So every year, out of 57, you always have 2 or 3 that just don't hit it, maybe weather is bad, maybe you don't have a perfect lineup, and you have 2 or 3 that hit it out of the park. In totality, as you can see by our numbers, we're growing 25% ticket sales year-over-year. So I think, definitely, the festival business is high-margin. Obviously, there's a lot of festivals continuing to evolve, but the leadership position that we have is the competitive advantage that lets us, obviously, buy in bulk, deliver sponsorship in bulk, ticketing in bulk, marketing in bulk. So it wouldn't be a business that you'd want to start today in one by one, but we believe that given we've been in this business for 10 years-plus and are a market leader, it lets us build it efficiently with a good tolerance to the risk that comes with them. 
John Tinker: And just another quick question. What's your view on paperless tickets in terms of the way to attack the secondary market and stop scalpers reselling? 
Michael Rapino: In general, our -- how sensible is this, we believe that our job is to protect the first sale and what I mean by that is I'd like to tell you that every artist is going to charge exactly what the market will bear, but that's not reality. There are some artists that just want to charge $99, regardless of how expensive that first row could go for. Our job is to figure out how to make that first sale secure. If Bruce Springsteen absolutely wants to charge $99 in Detroit, our job is to figure out all of the ways we can deliver that $99 ticket to a real fan who has a shot to buy it. Now what that fan does with it after, if they want to resell it on the secondary market, we're -- we have no problems with that, we'll support that. But anyway, we can help deliver that $99 to a true fan for the first sale is what we believe is we're in business to do and make that consumer feel like they have a shot of getting it. Now paperless is one tool you can use, which we've done many times. If you use paperless, it gives you a shot to deliver kind of a deterrent to the scalping system and deliver that to that first fan. I think, in general, mobile is going to be an incredible tool to deliver a digital ticket to an exact person, who then can walk in to that venue and scan it at the door. So whether it's paperless or whether it's mobile, we're continuing to look at new technology to deliver a direct sale to that first fan, and we think mobile is probably going to be the most exciting opportunity for us to deliver that digital ticket to that fan. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Rapino for closing remarks. 
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everybody, and have a great summer and we'll talk on Q3. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this includes the Live Nation Entertainment Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-09 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Carrie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements relating to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters.
 Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.
 Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation for the most comparable GAAP measure in their earnings release. The release, reconciliation and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found on www.livenation.com/investors.
 It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Azzof, Live Nation Entertainment's Chairman of the Board. 
Irving Azoff: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2012 earnings call. Joining me today are Michael Rapino, our CEO; and Kathy Willard, our CFO. I will begin the call with some brief comments and then turn it over to Michael, who will review our results for the quarter in more detail. 
 The global economic environment for discretionary consumer spending businesses remains difficult. Nevertheless, we continue to deliver improved results and make significant progress towards achieving the goals set following the merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster in 2010. 
 Touring activity during the first quarter is typically quiet. However, AOI for the quarter rose 7% on a 2% revenue increase. The concert performance and improvements to our ticketing platform, eCommerce capabilities, online advertising and Sponsorship businesses will be covered in more detail by Mike. 
 The continuing enhancements to the Ticketmaster systems to our new dynamic pricing tools, LiveAnalytics, Interactive Seat Maps and improving technologies are being well-received by our clients and consumers. 
 In addition to my broader role at Live Nation, I continue to lead Artist Nation, including Front Line Management. 
 Touring activity by our key artists during the first quarter was slower than last year. It was limited to Van Halen, Jimmy Buffett and Jason Aldean. Van Halen has extended their current tour with dates through the fall. Summer touring from key artists looks good. We continue our program of aggressive new artist signings and securing merchandise and VIP ticketing rights with established stars and even the new tween band sensation, One Direction. 
 So, thank you again for your support. I look forward to updating you on our progress during our next earnings call. I'd like now to turn it over to Michael for his remarks. Thanks, much. 
Michael Rapino: Thank you, Irving. We're off to a great start for the year and seeing some wind at our backs with strong fan demand. At Live Nation, we have sold 23% more concert tickets through April and 8% more at Ticketmaster. Sponsorship and advertising is on-track to deliver double-digit growth, and as a result, we are on track to deliver both top line and bottom line growth in 2012. 
 And as we look beyond, we continue to see great growth opportunity. We have still a limited presence outside of North America and Europe, markets that could generate 50% additional growth off our current base with higher margins in North America. We are one of the most passionate consumer products and yet 30% of fans still miss concerts because they didn't hear about the show. Social and mobile can go a long way in driving these sales. And we have the greatest music sponsorship platform in the industry. Just getting our fair share of spending would double this business. 
 And now let's look at our business units and how they're advancing on this strategy in Q2 -- in Q1. Live Nation continues to grow its global market share and profitability. Live Nation concerts ticket sales were up 23%. As we mentioned in the first quarter, up until April and consistently strong both in North America, up 25% and International, up 19%. 
 Looking at these results by business lines, festivals, our key focus for expansion and our highest margin concert product line, is off to a strong start. In North America, we launched several new festivals, and as a result, our North American festival sales were up over 30% and European festival sales were up 20% through Europe. 
 Electronic music, as we move -- and a big focus for us, with our acquisition today announced at Cream. We now have a strong portfolio making up our electronic nation, including 360 management, Cream and our existing tours and festivals. Cream already has festivals in 9 countries with over 350,000 fans under its umbrella globally, and we intend to grow this further. 
 And at the same time, we continue to build organically, with the new electronic festivals including I LOVE THIS CITY in San Francisco, PARADISO at the Gorge, World Electronic Festival in Toronto and Ibiza 123 in Spain. 
 Between our traditional and electronic festivals, this year we plan on producing 55 festivals with over 3 million fans in attendance. 
 Our amphitheater business is also off to a great start, with ticket sales up over 50% through the first 4 months of the year, and we expect to finish 2012 with attendance up double digits and increased profitability. 
 The growth will be driven by increased ticket sales coming from a diverse lineup, including artists such as Brad Paisley, Jason Aldean, One Direction and Big Time Rush, and fan favorites, Dave Matthews and Jimmy Buffett. 
 And we also rolled [ph] another dynamic pricing to optimize ticket revenue for each of the shows. We already have over 175 shows confirmed and expect to utilize dynamic pricing and 50% of our amphitheater shows this summer. And early reports continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic pricing, when we expect a 5% to 10% increase in revenue for the shows that use it. 
 Arenas and stadiums coming off a strong 2011, are also up this year, 8% through April. This, driven by another strong lineup including the Madonna, Jay-Z, Coldplay, Lady Gaga, Nickelback, Roger Waters, One Direction and Drake. 
 In both Live Nation and Ticketmaster, we continue to lead the industry with social engagement tools to drive fan awareness and sales. Last week, we rolled out the Live Nation concert calendar Facebook app, with a complete set of features. This app helps consumers find shows, share with their friends and get rewarded for being active fans. 
 While we continue to improve our current platform, we're actively evaluating opportunities to expand our business around the world. During the first quarter, we made great progress in our Pacific Rim strategy, including our new office in South Korea, a joint venture deal with Creative Man in Japan and the acquisition of Coppel in Australia, now gives us a cornerstone we need for the regions that have scale and build out our sponsorship and ticketing businesses. 
 Looking forward, we believe the countries -- there's continued to be countries to explore such as Latin America, Eastern and Northern Europe, as we continue to evaluate opportunities. 
 Ticketmaster continues to lead the marketplace, while improving its user experience. We achieved a net retention rate of over 100% again, in the first quarter. Major clients we renewed are signed so far this year, include Madison Square Garden in New York, Barclays in Brooklyn, and at this point, I expect us to maintain a net renewal rate of at least 100% for the year. 
 We continue to improve the user-buying experience online and net mobile to drive cart conversion. Every 1% improvement in our cart conversion drives over $10 million increase to AOI.  Historically, Ticketmaster has been below best-in-class for eCommerce companies, but we see this as a major opportunity as we improve the user experience. 
 As part of this, the rollout of Interactive Seat Maps is core to enabling a better experience with fans and therefore, improving cart conversion. 
 In the first quarter, 44% of our events had Interactive Seat Maps, up from 17% a year ago. We've been tracking the impact and it's clearly helpful in lifting cart conversion. 
 In mobile, we are now seeing a meaningful shift to ticket sales to our app and mobile sites. For North American in the first quarter, mobile ticket sales represented 5% of our total online ticket sales, up from 1% in the quarter last year. We expect this growth to continue globally through the year, with broad rollouts planned for our Ticketmaster apps. 
 Our secondary business continues to be a growth driver. We had great success in the first quarter with both Barclays and Madison Square Garden, signing up for TicketsNow to be their official secondary ticketing partner. We also renewed our secondary deal with the NFL, continuing to have TicketsNow to be the official secondary ticketing partner for the NFL Exchange. And through April, secondary ticket volume is up double digits year-on-year. 
 And finally, we are driving our -- driving growth in Live Nation through our high-margin sponsorship and advertising business. Sponsorship is on track to again to deliver double-digit growth, with committed sponsorship of -- as of the start of this month, 10% ahead of last year. We have delivered similar strong performance in online advertising, growing over 20% in the first quarter, benefiting from our continued focus on creating attractive online ad units, and the new sales team we put in place last year. 
 Looking at the early success, we expect sponsors from advertising to continue to be a strong growth area and deliver our double-digit AOI growth this year again. 
 Our vision is clear: Expand our platform, sell more tickets by better serving and engaging the fans, and monetize this audiences with the advertisers. With our strong 2012 lineup and fan demand, I expect we will deliver our planned growth and revenue AOI and cash flow for the year. 
 With that, I will turn it over to Kathy. 
Elizabeth Willard: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. 2012 is off to a great start with the first quarter results, and we have again delivered growth in all of our key financial metrics. Revenue, adjusted operating income, operating income and free cash flow. Beginning in 2012, we have reduced our reportable segments from 5 to 4. They are now concerts, ticketing, Artist Nation and Sponsorship and advertising. All online advertising and online Sponsorship revenue from the previously reported eCommerce segment are now included in sponsorship and advertising, while all of their activity for eCommerce has been allocated to the ticketing segment. This change was made to adjust the segments to how we manage the operations of our 4 main businesses. 
 In the first quarter, revenue grew 2% to $868 million. Concerts' revenue was flat year-over-year on slightly increased show count and attendance due to low -- due to fewer shows in stadiums and arenas as compared to last year. Ticketing revenue was up 3%, driven particularly by strength in ticket sales in Europe. As a note to this, we've seen through April and early May, the International ticket sales are continuing to hold up and are doing even better in the second quarter, with double-digit ticket sales growth in April for all Ticketmaster events regardless of timing. 
 Increased online advertising activity drove a 9% increase in Sponsorship and advertising revenue during the quarter. And Artist Nation revenue grew 13% over last year due to 2011 acquisitions, along with higher management commissions and merchandise and VIP ticket sales. 
 For the quarter, adjusted operating income increased 7% to $48 million compared to last year's $45 million. The concerts division grew AOI year-over-year by 40%, driven by improved arena show results and increased show count. Ticketing increased the number of tickets sold by 6% in the quarter, but their AOI is down 14% driven by higher Olympics fees earned last year and the planned increased cost related to investments, including the ticketing re-platform project. The increased fixed cost level is, as we have previously discussed, and while we see some quarter-to-quarter swings, for the year, we currently expect a year-on-year increase of around $10 million. 
 Sponsorship and advertised AOI grew 13%, largely as a result of increased online advertising, along with sponsorship growth in Europe. As a result, AOI margins were up slightly in the quarter, driven by concerts and sponsorship margin improvement. 
 Our operating loss for the quarter was $43 million compared to an operating loss of $72 million last year. The reduced operating loss is primarily due to the increased AOI, along with $24 million of stock-based compensation incurred in the first quarter of 2011 from the acquisition and the remaining equity interest in Front Line. 
 Overall, our net loss during the quarter was $69 million compared to a net loss of $48 million in 2011. Last year, we also recognized a tax benefit of $51 million, also related to the Front Line acquisition, which reduced the first quarter 2011 net loss. On a comparable basis, without these acquisition impacts, our overall net loss has improved 9%. 
 For the quarter, our free cash flow was $23 million, compared to a loss of $7 million in 2011. This increase in the quarter was driven by positive cash taxes from the collection of tax receivables from year end. 
 As of March 31, we had total cash of $1.1 billion, which includes $422 million in ticketing client cash, with $264 million in free cash. Event-related deferred revenue was $613 million at March 31 compared to $573 million last year. This increase in deferred revenue is consistent with the 23% increase in concert ticket sales that Michael discussed. 
 Cash provided by operating activities was $265 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, compared to $128 million for the first quarter of '11. This increase is driven by higher deferred revenue, net of an increase in prepaid show cost, collection of tax receivables and a reduction in payments of liabilities during the period. 
 The main difference between cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in this quarter is the increase in net deferred revenue of $251 million. Since we defer our concerts ticket revenue, until the event occurs, and many of the event costs don't get paid until the show, free cash flow doesn't consider these proceeds until after the event date. Currently, the combined CapEx during 2012 is expected to be approximately $125 million. Our historical CapEx spend of about $100 million is fairly evenly split between maintenance and growth CapEx. The $25 million incremental amount is for this year's push with the cost related to redesign, and implementation of the Ticketmaster re-platforming project we've discussed before. This multi-year project is nearing completion of the first year and is on time and on budget. 
 As of March 31, our total current and long-term debt including capital leases was $1.7 billion with nothing outstanding on our revolver. We made $7 million in net debt repayments in the quarter and our weighted average cost of debt, excluding debt discounts and premiums, is 6%. We continue to remain comfortably in compliance with our debt covenant requirements under our credit facility. 
 As of March 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was under 4x versus the maximum of 4.5x, and our interest coverage ratio was over 4.4x versus the minimum ratio of 2.75. 
 Based on the results we've delivered this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to deliver continued AOI and free cash flow growth in 2012. We are focused on our core profit drivers for the remainder of the year, specifically continuing to build out our global concert position, which we currently expect to deliver a mid-to-high single-digit increase in attendance, with solid growth in AOI. 
 The second and third quarters are the biggest for this segment. Although the timing of shows in overall volume can vary between these quarters year-over-year. 
 This year, the third quarter looks particularly strong, as we will have Madonna and Lady Gaga playing 68 shows globally; two, investing in our Ticketmaster business, to ensure that we remain the market leader in ticketing for venues and fans globally. We currently expect overall ticket sales to be slightly up in 2012, which we believe will drive growth and operating performance. We expect to reinvest this profit growth into the business through the Ticketmaster technology re-platforming, along with our other improvements we are making to our mobile, social and online products. 
 And lastly, we are on track to continue growing our Sponsorship and advertising network, which we believe will again be one of our strongest growth drivers and is currently expected to deliver low double-digit growth in AOI. 
 Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2011 update. And we will now open up the call for questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Joyce with Miller Tabak. 
David Joyce: Housekeeping things to understand. One, on the free cash flow and strength on the tax receivables. What was that related to that was building up, if you could just help us understand that a little bit more? 
Elizabeth Willard: Yes, primarily, we talked about this at year end, David. But it's primarily related to the Front Line acquisition and some benefits we got for carrying back against our NOL. So that was the biggest piece of it. 
David Joyce: Okay. And Irving, you mentioned some of the global economic issues. Is that primarily reflected on the International side because it looked like North America was still fairly strong? 
Michael Rapino: Well, I think I'm not sure if Irving can jump in, but generally, the concern is always, we don't want to get too optimistic and ahead of ourselves. We are seeing great trends throughout the globe. Lady Gaga shows are selling out from Asia to Europe, so we're having a strong year. What we're always looking, as everyone else is, to the economic challenges and seeing if they're affecting our business. Europe, which most people wonder about, has been very strong for us. That's why I referred to sales up 19%. Most of our business, well over 80% of our businesses is in Northern Europe. A very small percentage of our business is in Spain, and none of it in Greece. So right now, we really haven't been affected by any of the global economic challenges. Northern Europe and Europe is ahead of last year. North America is ahead, and even our businesses in Asia and others are all strong. So we're always -- we are looking, but right now, we're very confident that the industry and our lineup are going to have a strong year from the ticket sales perspective. 
David Joyce: And finally, if we could just understand some of the re-categorization, it looks like the ad revenue online that was shifted to the Sponsorship and advertising level was almost all margin, whereas the other revenue had more expenses attached to it that went to the ticketing side. If you could explain what moved around there, please? 
Elizabeth Willard: That's correct. I mean, basically it's the online advertising piece that went into Sponsorship and advertising, which is fairly high-margin. The cost for most of the sellers who are already in the Sponsorship division, so there wasn't a whole lot of direct cost transfer. And the rest of the business, which is the upsell, the fee per ticket and then the cost to run the websites and all the online activities, is the piece that shifted into ticketing. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Ben Mogil with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Benjamin Mogil: So when you talk about sort of double-digit tenants growth in the North American amphitheaters, if you look at it on a per show basis, what kind of number would you be looking for? I'm trying to get a sense of show count as you head into the year? 
Michael Rapino: As you can you -- as you know from the number right now, we're tracking incredibly ahead of last year at 50%. When it all shakes out over the summer, show-per-show, year-over-year, we would still expect on a per show basis, our tenants to be up in the high-single to double digits. 
Benjamin Mogil: I'm guessing, Michael, it's too early to have any sense of what food and beverage looks like this year? 
Michael Rapino: Yes, too early. I mean, the only window we get is from January to now, in all of our theater club arena business in terms of what we're doing. And all of those trends seem to be holding up year-over-year and ahead. So we don't see anything that would alert that the sum will be any different in the first 4 months when consumers have showed up at the building they were spending equally to last year. 
Benjamin Mogil: Okay. And then Kathy, this one for you. On the European situation, have you -- I know in the past, you've always hedged your, sort of guarantees out of Europe, et cetera, and your anticipated cash flows, have you done that by this time of the year? 
Elizabeth Willard: Yes, we haven't changed that process, so we continue on those artist contracts to absolutely hedge those for any unpaid amounts. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Tinker with Maxim. 
John Tinker: Could you just talk a little more about the secondary markets? Obviously, so you mentioned you're working with the Garden, Barclays, NFL, and what size of shares do you think would be a good go for you to shoot for that? And secondly, could you just touch base on where you are with AEG and the Staples center, and who's managing that -- I'm sorry, who's selling tickets for that still? 
Michael Rapino: Well, I'll answer the Staples, because it's the easiest. The Ticketmaster still is the ticketing partner agent for the Staples Center. So, I guess, at some point it may -- will be shifted to the new platform. But as of now, we're still doing all of the business at that building. And as far as the secondary business, there's 2 ways to look at the secondary. The first and foremost for us is just to make sure we have as much content or tickets at our platform as possible. So anyway we can leverage any of our existing Ticketmaster inventory or Ticketmaster clients, and get that inventory at TicketsNow, that's our first step in competing against the market leader out there. So it's stuck whether it's Live Nation, whether it's Madison Square Garden or the NFL, having any of that inventory exclusively or a first-comes basis on our inventory will help us drive our proposition. And then second, is to drive traffic to our TicketsNow website. Again, the way we can grow that business against the leader and the easiest way we can grow it is through the synergy of the Ticketmaster. The traffic we have at Ticketmaster, any time now you have no-tickets-page found. If we can do it in the proper way where the consumer is fully aware and its transparent, that is the secret sauce to delivering volume over to TicketsNow and driving our consumer business. So my team's worked hard this year and complied to all the previous issues with the FCC, and etc. had -- FTC, and we think this year, we'll be able to drive a lot of traffic to TicketsNow from our main business sites. 
 So if we achieved both of those goals, increased our traffic this year and increased our inventory. You've already seen from the first quarter, ticket sales, volume is up double digits for us. And we have a very, very aggressive goal and target over the next 2 years on how we think that business can chip away at the market leader from a AOI  and a ticket allocation perspective. 
John Tinker: Just one follow-up if I could. You exclude ticket sales for the 2012 London Olympics. Can you just say how's that's going and how that goes to your P&L? 
Elizabeth Willard: For the tickets sold for the Olympics were not reported as tickets, they were fees that we earned and most of that, as you know, was earned last year. 
John Tinker: Okay, so you don't get any incremental revenue at all now? 
Michael Rapino: I mean, the majority of the -- remember Ticketmaster counts the money when the sale was made, and Live Nation counts the money when the show happens. Olympics are only at Ticketmaster's side of the equation. Most of the tickets were sold in 2011 for the Olympics. There is a on-sale starting this weekend and next, so there will still be some tickets that are being sold in 2012. But the vast majority of the Olympic tickets were sold in 2011, and the recorded service fees were in the 2011 Q4 numbers. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Bishop Cheen with Wells Fargo. 
Bishop Cheen: Look, just -- I'm looking real quick, because I haven't seen the Q come across. It looks like the balance sheet and the layers of the secured senior and total debt are pretty much the same as they were at December 31. Is that the right impression? 
Elizabeth Willard: That's correct. 
Bishop Cheen: Okay. And then secondly, this is kind of more of a bigger picture question. Because of the upgrade, for lack of a better word, enhancement of state-of-the-art for your ticketing platform, can you remind us again, that is a multi-year project, or when is the inflection point that we would notice a substantial benefit prone to the economics to Live Nation from that upgrade and enhancement? 
Michael Rapino: Good question. I think there's 2 paths to where the benefits come. One is along the way and then one is at the end from a more fixed cost perspective. So the first and most important thing about re-platforming our technology, while we're doing it, we are also able to use some of the features and functionalities that are being developed to launch during the 3-year process. So the process started last year, that we were going to upgrade our platform and our code. Over those 3 years, we would be able to use some of that investment that comes to market. So Interactive Seat Maps, we're launching a new client portal to our customers this year.  Historically, Ticketmaster had a green screen portal for our clients for 20 years. It can't -- if you can't survive in the future in that kind of technology, well, we're going to be launching a state-of-the-art client portal this year for our customers. So that's a benefit that is being built under the new platform, but can launch that feature and functionality now. So over the 3 years, we will continually have features and functions whether it's on the website, whether it's our API coming to life or whether it's for our B2B that will help us, first and foremost, maintain and acquire new customers. So I think in a big picture, when we took this business over 2 years ago, the business had declined for 5 years, both from an AOI, and from a net renewal process. In the last year and a half, we have reversed the AOI trend and grew the business in 2011. But more importantly, we've also reversed the renewal and now are looking somewhere in the 100% renewal rate. So we believe, first and foremost, for the customers in our venues, the fact that they know we are now investing and they're seeing some products come to life is a big part of our sales proposition on either renewing. So you're going to see an ongoing strong renewal leadership position because we are upgrading on the go. So that's, first and foremost, maintain and grow our leadership position. Over the 3 years, as we adopt the new platform and get it installed into our client base, the core main benefit of that platform is that it can operate at a much lower variable and fixed cost per ticket. Right now, we have a very old platform that requires a lot of variable and fixed cost to maintain and run. With a new Web-based platform, we'll be able to run that, remotely run it, reduce -- run it at a lower cost basis. So if you're selling well over $100 million tickets and they're able to run that business at a lower fixed and variable cost per ticket, we think that comes to life in year 3, and the ROI that it'd be a total investment is $100 million over those years with a platform from a fixed and CapEx perspective, the return on that $100 million is close to a 1- or 2-year return, based on your economics that are running a lower leaner machine, against your core business, regardless of any future functionality, the new business you've generated, as your cost basis per ticket goes down. 
Bishop Cheen: Okay, so that means you're recapturing your investment between one and 2 years depending at when you start the clock at the end of the third year? 
Michael Rapino: Yes, I think you could make -- I mean, there's 2 business cases. If you did nothing for the next 3 years, what -- where would your business have declined and what AOI would you have lost? So step one, is we turn the decline, and now have this business healthy, robust, and our clients more importantly, now see that the vigor around the innovation and the technology as we will deliver them, is leading in world-class. So that's why, I believe for 3 years, we will continue to grow and maintain a strong core business, renewal business. So we'll protect our current business. And then step 2, yes, you're kind of the -- just if you looked at the 2-year return, going into the third year, just operating your business off that new lower cost basis, you have a 1 to 2 year return on that capital. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Tullo with Albert Fried. 
Richard Tullo: One question is, specifically what kind of headwinds did you see from the truncated NBA season in the first quarter? Was it -- arena availability hard to come by? I've heard, anecdotally from different venues, that it was a challenge fitting in concerts, as well as gains? And do you expect in the fourth quarter the comparables in regards to the NBA and the arena availability to improve since there will be no NBA lockout in the fourth quarter of this year? 
Michael Rapino: Yes, I mean, in general, the lockout and the length of it in the grand picture was fairly not affected to our bottom line. We lost some ticket sales, gained a few shows, a few concert shows where we had some fees on it, and then business got back fairly quickly and the tickets sales started start again. So in a net overall, it was I think at the time, we said somewhere, it might have caused us $5 million in AOI to our bottom line at Ticketmaster for some lost ticket sales that weren't replaced by maybe concerts or other events. So net year-over-year, we might have a $5 million pick up in Q4 next year if you wanted to do it straight apples-for-apples in terms of ticket sales-to-shows. 
Richard Tullo: And then just kind of a follow-up, on the pacing of the incremental CapEx for Ticketmaster, is that going to flow evenly throughout the year, or is it more weighted in the first half. 
Elizabeth Willard: It's going to be -- yes, for this year, the piece, the $25 million, it should be fairly even throughout the year. And then obviously, the project continues over the multi-years of the project. Because we're just finishing year 1 and it's the 3 years of the full project. 
Operator: And there are no further questions. [Operator Instructions] 
Michael Rapino: All right. Thank you. 
Operator: And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Rapino for closing. 
Michael Rapino: Great. Thank you, everybody. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Live Nation Entertainment First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-23 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Carrie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
 Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements relating to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters.
 Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.
 Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation for the most comparable GAAP measure in their earnings release. The release, reconciliations and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found on www.livenation.com/investors.
 It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Azoff, Live Nation Entertainment's Chairman of the Board. 
Irving Azoff: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter 2011 earnings call. Joining me today are Michael Rapino, our CEO; and Kathy Willard, our CFO. I will begin the call with some brief comments and then turn it over to Michael, who will review our fourth quarter and 2011 full year results.
 Despite the difficult global economic environment for discretionary consumer spending businesses, we continue to deliver improved results and make significant progress towards achieving the goals set following the merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster in 2010. The strong concert performance and improvements to our Ticketing platform, e-commerce capabilities, online advertising and sponsorship businesses will be covered in more detail by Michael.
 The continuing enhancements to the Ticketmaster systems for our new dynamic pricing tools, LiveAnalytics, Interactive Seat Maps and improving technologies are being well received by our clients and also by consumers.
 In addition to my broader role at Live Nation, I continue to lead Artist Nation, including Front Line Management. Our key artists have been far more active during 2011, delivering improvements in management business results for the year of 36% above last year. Despite some slippage of a few key artist tour plans to 2012, 2 of these, Van Halen and Neil Diamond, already have tours underway and are doing terrific business. Several acts like Jason Aldean have had amazing breakthroughs this year. The Eagles, Jimmy Buffett, Journey, Steely Dan and many of our vintage acts continued their strong tour performances during last year. We continue to sign major superstar talent like Mariah Carey, and we concluded a multi-rights deal with Sony and Nickelodeon for the incredibly hot tween band, Big Time Rush.
 As reported previously, the improvement in our management business has been offset by higher cost this year in the Live Nation merchandise business, identified as we continue to integrate and restructure our 2 merchandise businesses. We've successfully integrated the group's various VIP Ticketing businesses and look to more effective and profitable results from these going forward.
 So thank you again for your support, and I look forward to updating you to our progress on the next earnings call.
 And now I'd like to turn this over to Michael for his remarks. 
Michael Rapino: Thank you, Irving. Good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on 2011, we set out to grow profitability in our core businesses, invest in our Ticketing platform and start to launch innovative products to better serve and engage the fans.
 Taking a look at the scorecard a year later, we delivered on this mission. We grew revenue and AOI in each of our businesses. We turned concerts around and doubled AOI; improved Ticketmaster profitability for the first time in 5 years; grew sponsorship AOI by 12% and e-commerce AOI by 41%; and as a result, delivered overall revenue growth of 6% and AOI growth of 21%. Free cash flow grew 23%, demonstrating our ability to convert AOI into cash. We launched new innovative products such as Facebook seat maps, Live Nation apps, GrouponLive, LiveAnalytics, Pricemaster and upgraded our ticketmaster.com checkout. 
 In 2012, we will build on our 2011 successes and continue to focus on the key strategic drivers that will grow our business. Number one is to continue to grow our core businesses through better cost execution and expanded revenue; two is to launch innovative products at both Ticketmaster and Live Nation that drive fan engagement and conversion; three, to invest in our Ticketmaster technology re-platform; and four, to continue to expand into untapped global markets.
 Now I'll take you through our divisional updates. On the concert side, in 2011, I spoke that I expected that year to be one of stable demand despite economic uncertainty, with growth being driven by a proved execution, and that is exactly what we delivered in 2011.
 And 2007 (sic) [2011] highlights. We expanded our portfolio of festivals, electronic and geographic markets; we launched 10 new festivals; we moved strongly into the electronic music space, promoting 148 electronic concerts and festivals during the year to nearly 700,000 fans; we launched a North American electronic amp tour called Identity; and invested through Roc Nation's 360 management, a leading electronic management company, which represents 18 artists; and finally, we continued to expand globally by launching offices in Korea and Croatia.
 Our second priority was to create a new distribution platform for distressed tickets with casual fans, and together with Groupon, we launched GrouponLive and sold 1.1 million tickets.
 And our third priority at Live Nation was to launch our Live Nation app and mobile site. The app now has been downloaded by over 3 million fans, and we have sold 2 million tickets across our mobile platform and growing. The app was a great step in our mission to engage the concert fan directly. In that app, we had features that tested mobile concessions at 16 of our amps. And the app also featured an -- in-venue live sets and concert feeds from over 2,700 concerts. We sent nearly 9 million last minute ticket alerts to iPhone fans on day of show by scanning their library.
 Looking forward to 2012, we expect to see continued strong consumer demand, enabling us to continue to build our concert portfolio, promote more concerts, sell more tickets and increase profitability.
 The 2012 pipeline looks strong across all channels. On the festival side, I expect us to have one of our best global festival lineups in 2012. We have great headliners in place, such as Bruce Springsteen, Black Keys, Pearl Jam and Rihanna, all selling very well. On the arenas and stadiums side, it looks to be another great year with global acts such as Lady Gaga, Coldplay, Nickelback, Roger Waters, Van Halen and Madonna selling well and more to come. And our amphitheater lineup looks strong so far. We've got a diverse lineup from Brad Paisley and Jason Aldean, the Big Time Rush, Lil Wayne and Drake, and classics like Dave Matthews and Jimmy Buffett. So overall, we expect a strong year for all of our global channels.
 In terms of focusing strategically in the concert division, we'll continue to focus on these areas: continue expansion of our portfolio; we will launch a handful of festivals in 2012 from North America and both global, which will bring our total to 50 total global festivals and continue to make us the leader in global production of festivals; we'll continue to expand our electronic music genre, which is an exciting new genre of music, and we'll continue to aggressively grow our management, festival and touring business in that space; and we'll continue to look for geographic expansion in areas such as Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and today's announcement of our joint venture in Japan is another continual step in that expansion strategy.
 We'll also continue on our livenation.com and Live Nation app updates. We brought in a new team from BigChampagne to elevate our Live Nation online and mobile channels, to drive even greater fan engagement with the avid concert fan. And you can expect new releases coming on both of those channels this year, which we think will continue to drive sales and engagement.
 And we're ready to finally roll out our dynamic pricing or what we call Pricemaster for our concert division. This year, the concert team will implement Pricemaster and dynamic pricing tools for most of our amphitheater shows, and we already have 100 of those shows confirmed by artists.
 When you look at 2012 concerts in whole, the industry looks strong. It seems to be rebounding back globally, and I expect us to continue growing the Live Nation business across this entire concert ecosystem, engaging more fans to drive ticket sales and servicing artists from clubs to stadiums around the world.
 Our sponsorship and online division continues to be one of the strongest stars in our portfolio, driven mostly by the incredible robust concert lineup that hinges off our sponsorship strategy. We delivered on expectations in 2011 in group sponsorship AOI, 12%; and online, 33%. We broadened our categories and extended our global platform to such brands as American Express, Starwood, Hertz, Vodafone and Citi. And our online advertising doubled in size to 33% growth, and we continue that to continue to grow strong in 2012.
 In 2012, we will continue to grow and add more global strategic partners, continue reinventing our festival and amphitheater product lineup to attract sponsors, and we expect continued double-digit growth online and mobile ad sales as we deliver richer and stronger engagement of both Live Nation and ticketmaster.com on our mobile sites. So 2012 for our advertising sponsorship business continues to look strong, with strong runway ahead of us and AOI growth expected.
 Ticketing. It's been over 2 years since we completed the acquisition and merger of Ticketmaster, and I believe the progress we have made with this business can be summed up with 2 points: first, Ticketmaster's AOI grew 18% year-over-year in 2011, the first time in 5 years; and second, Ticketmaster was just named by Fast Company as one of the top 10 innovative companies in music, after being considered a technology laggard for the past decade. What I'm most proud about is that we accomplished both of these feats at the same time.
 And 2011 highlights. We achieved a net renewal rate of 102% across our 12,000 venue base, demonstrating both the value of the customer, place and working with Ticketmaster, as well as the strength of our platform, and we continued to invest in several key areas. We launched our 3-year program to re-platform Ticketmaster's technology. As part of this effort, we hired over 100 expert technology employees from the Googles, Amazon, Microsofts of the world, and we now have deployed several pieces of this core technology and infrastructure in our reporting tools for our clients.
 Also we launched an incredible, aggressive social program this year. Given the natural engagement of the fan on the social platforms, we invested to create some innovative products at Facebook from our RSV [ph] to Interactive Seat Maps to our recent app in-store purchase at Facebook.
 And finally, we made data a priority in 2011. We invested first in our data consolidation. We consolidated 9 data sources into 1 data warehouse to power our LiveAnalytics, and now have a database of over 200 million fans, in which 110 have opted in to get e-mails marketing from us. We launched our LiveAnalytics company and now engage with over 50 customers, including 23 major league teams signed up for this service. And we completed our initial development and launched our dynamic pricing tool, Pricemaster.
 In 2012, we'll continue on similar strategies. Number one priority is always to maintain our retention rate on our customers. Second, we plan on delivering double-digit growth in our secondary business. We are committed to working with artists and teams to further educate fans on the benefits of validated ticket exchanges. Third, we will follow up on our Live Nation app and launch Ticketmaster apps across all of the platforms in all of our markets, with our Ticketmaster app recently just launched at iTunes. And finally, we are entering Tier 2 of the 3 of our investment in our re-platform of technology, building a "state of the art" ticketing technology platform. This year, we plan on launching new search and inventory services, along with additional venue reporting and yield management tools as the start of some new products that come from this re-platform.
 Overall, I'm very excited about Ticketmaster's potential. While I expect the addition investments in mobile and our ticketing system will limit AOI growth in 2012, as the market leader we have stabilized the business and created a new vision and road map for long-term growth.
 Before we head off into the final summary, I want to give you an update on where we are in ticket sales, both for '11 and where we stand as of kind of today. In 2011, Ticketmaster sold 140 million tickets, which is an 11% increase year-over-year. Live Nation global concerts sold 47 million tickets, which was flat versus 2010. Basically as we outlined throughout the year, we cut over 2 million amp tickets as we focused on profitability versus revenue in 2011 in our concert division.
 In 2012, we're off to a great year. At Ticketmaster, sales through February 19 were still up over 3%. The industry had a very strong January, with 7% growth year-over-year led by sales for the NBA, soccer and concert on-sales. February through the 19th was down 3%, with fewer major on-sales in February. But we expect that these months smooth over year-over-year, that 2012 will finish up in single digits growth versus 2011.
 On the concert division, through February 19 of this year, Live Nation concert sales were up 22% year-over-year, outpacing Ticketmaster concert industry, which is down 8%. North American concert sales are up 28% and International concert sales are up 13%. To give a bit more color on fan demand in Europe, ticket sales for our 2012 European festivals were up 14% compared to where they were last time this year. We have benefited early this year from tremendous fan demand for Madonna, Coldplay, Roger Waters, Van Halen and others, and we believe 2012 will be a great year with year-over-year low single-digit growth when timing of on-sales levels out.
 In summary, if you look at 2012, our 4 core businesses of concerts, Ticketing, management, and advertising have on a lot of global runway ahead of them. And as we start to see the fruits from injecting a fan-focused vision, these assets will continue to have incredible potential to grow globally. We are the leader in these core businesses and believe we will continue to be the leader. And as we innovate with the fan and engage them more and convert more ticket sales, we believe we have an incredible growth of runway for all of these businesses in 2012 onward.
 I'll turn it over to Kathy. 
Elizabeth Willard: Thank you, Michael, and hello, everyone. We are pleased with our results for 2011 as we delivered growth in all our key financial metrics. Revenue, adjusted operating income, operating income, net income and free cash flow are all higher. And once again, we have improved our gross margins, AOI margins, operating margin and net margin for the year. 
 As we've discussed, we believe the full year results are the most accurate gauge of our performance, given fluctuations in concert and ticket on-sale timing. I will get into the specifics, but as a top line, we delivered solid revenue growth and significant improvement across AOI, operating income and net income.
 For the full year 2011, revenue grew 6% to $5.4 billion, with revenue growth across every one of our segments. Concerts revenue grew by 2% on slightly increased show count and roughly flat attendance. Ticketing revenue was up 14%, driven by the increase in ticket sales. Increased online advertising and up-sell activity, along with higher online ticket sales, drove a 64% increase in e-commerce revenue during 2011. And lastly, sponsorship and Artist Nation delivered strong revenue growth over last year from new sponsorship relationships and higher touring activity by our managed artists.
 For the year, adjusted operating income increased 21% to $438 million. The concert division doubled AOI year-over-year, as we executed better on our core arena and amphitheater platforms, while expanding our portfolio and investing close to $10 million in new festivals. Ticketing AOI was up 18% due to increased ticket sales and the 2012 London Olympics. We are pleased that we delivered this profitability growth in ticketing, while also making a substantial investment in the Ticketmaster technology re-platforming project. E-commerce grew AOI 41%, largely as a result of increased advertising and up-sell revenue, while also investing in social and mobile products. And sponsorship also delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 12% as we continue growing this business while maintaining its strong margins.
 Our operating income for the year was $18 million compared to an operating loss of $64 million in the prior year. $75 million of this $82-million overall improvement was driven by our higher AOI.
 Overall, our net income during the year improved by $145 million to a net loss of $83 million. This improvement came from $82 million in higher operating income, $40 million in income tax benefits associated with our Front Line acquisition and the $21-million debt issuance cost write-off in 2010. 
 During the fourth quarter as compared to last year, we've improved our gross margin to 31%. Our AOI margin has stayed relatively flat at 4.3%. Our operating margin improved by 1.3%, and our net margin was up 1.7%. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to last year, driven by a decline in global touring activity and concerts, since U2 and Lady Gaga were out on tour in the fourth quarter of 2010. So we had no similar activity this quarter.
 As we previously indicated, our concerts have substantial timing fluctuations and trends need to be looked at over a longer cycle than just one quarter. All segments other than concerts delivered revenue growth in the quarter.
 Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $51 million compared to $57 million in the prior year. Although our operations improved for the period, the decline in AOI was driven by higher legal costs related to the live concert anti-trust litigation and an increase in performance-related compensation. 
 As of December 31, we had total cash of $844 million, which includes free cash of $335 million. The remainder is made up of $374 million in Ticketing client cash, and $135 million in concert event-related cash. 
 Overall in 2011, we delivered $136 million in cash flow from operations. We then invested $108 million in capital expenditures and $55 million in acquisitions. We also made debt payments of $32 million, and increased cash $24 million from equity distributions, assets sales and FX benefits. In that result was a slight decline in our free cash year-on-year of $35 million.
 On our investments, those acquisitions in CapEx have defined investment criteria, which requires a return in excess of the projects' risk adjusted WACC threshold. Our major acquisitions in 2011 were ticketing businesses in Spain and D.C. and Hewitt/Silva concert promotions in California.
 On CapEx, as I said in the past, our ongoing run rate of spend is about $100 million, deployed between maintenance and growth CapEx. In addition, starting in 2011, we will have a 3-year increase in CapEx due to our Ticketmaster technology re-platforming. This project increased our CapEx by about $50 million in 2011, and we expect the total CapEx to investment -- total CapEx investment to be approximately $75 million and AOI investment of approximately half this over the 3 years of the project.
 Obviously, we have substantial monitoring in place for a project of this size, and have engaged a big 4 accounting firm to conduct regular audits on the project. And as of yesterday, the report was that it remains fully on track to achieve its objective. As a result, we expect total CapEx for 2012 currently to be approximately $125 million.
 Turning back to cash for the full year, our free cash flow was $203 million compared to $165 million in 2010. This increase in the year was driven by the improvement in AOI of $75 million, partially offset by higher interest and maintenance capital expenditures. We don't expect either of these issues to be an offset in 2012.
 The main difference between cash flow from operations and free cash flow are working capital requirements which were a $148-million use of cash in 2011. There were 2 primary drivers of this increase: First, event-related deferred revenue declined $80 million during the year, driven by on-sale timing of a handful of key acts. In 2010, we sold over 1 million U2 tickets alone for 2011 shows, while we had a much lower volume of 2011 ticket sales for 2012 shows. However, to give you some comfort that this is a specific timing issue, in the month of January 2012, our deferred revenues have increased by $87 million, and given our projections of slight growth in concert ticket sales, the numbers should even out.
 The other 2 factors impacting working capital are timing of collection of the tax receivable, which has now been received, and timing of artist and venue advances. Money, we believe, is well spent to lock in these artists and venues for the company. Right now, we don't expect working capital to increase for the year.
 As of December 31, our total current and long-term debt including capital leases was $1.7 billion with nothing outstanding on our revolver. We made $32 million in debt repayments in 2011. Our weighted average cost of debt excluding debt discounts and premiums is 6%.
 We continue to remain comfortably in compliance with our debt covenant requirements under our credit facility. As of December 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was under 4x versus the maximum 4.5x. And our interest coverage ratio was over 4.4x versus the minimum ratio of 2.75x.
 Through 2011, 40% to 50% of our AOI was generated outside of the U.S. These non-U.S. income, however, is fairly evenly split across the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and all others, so we do not face high concentrations in any one currency. As in the past, we continue to hedge artist contracts to cover our exposure when artists are paid in the currency different than the currency the tickets are sold in.
 We are very pleased with the results we have delivered in 2011 and remain confident in our ability to deliver growth in 2012. As Michael mentioned, continued improvement in profitability will be a key focus for the management team in 2012, and we expect this to be driven by continuing to build out our concert portfolio. We expect this to deliver a low single-digit increase in attendance. We will continue growing our advertising and sponsorship network. We expect our advertising to maintain its momentum of strong growth in 2012, and we will invest in our Ticketmaster business. We expect overall ticket sales to be flat to slightly up in 2012. And while we plan on achieving improved operating efficiency, we expect that this will be substantially offset by our increased investments in the Ticketmaster technology re-platforming and mobile and social product.
 We thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2011 update. And we will now open up the call for questions, operator. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Joyce with Miller Tabak. 
David Joyce: Questions on the ticketing. You've excluded the London Olympics from the metrics in the press release. Is there a -- could you talk about any sort of different economics related to that or why you would have excluded them? Is just -- is it just really skew the comparability? 
Elizabeth Willard: We are just -- we're paid a fee on each ticket we sold. Those have been excluded all year. So there's no change in that methodology, David. We're just trying to make that clear that those are not in the ticket sales. 
David Joyce: Okay. And in November, you had discussed the headwinds for the fourth quarter of the lack of NBA game ticket sales and the lack of the Wickeds, new shows, but it looks like you more than made up for that. What would you attribute that to? 
Elizabeth Willard: It's overall. Obviously, the timing of the NBA lockout was not as impactful. The concert ticket sales were, but overall Ticketmaster had higher ticket sales than we had expected at that time, and we're very pleased with the reduced impact of the NBA. 
David Joyce: All right. And finally, if you could just clarify... 
Michael Rapino: I'm sorry, David. David, just to add to that. As you can see, it was a -- we've had an early start to the concert year in general. So both December and in January, a lot have be-gone sales have happened, which is great for our business. So they got some relief from the concert side to cover up for the NBA fall. 
David Joyce: Understood. Okay. And just some final clarification on what you said, Kathy, that the ticket sales would be flat to slightly up this year. But you said there would be an offset for the investments in mobile and platform. You mean an AOI offset because of -- you were talking about the AOI impact from this one... 
Elizabeth Willard: Correct, the investments in the business that go through operating expenses from Ticketmaster. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ben Mogil with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Benjamin Mogil: Kathy, in your comments that you expect ticket sales to be sort of flat to slightly up in '12, and Michael's comments earlier about sort of his expectation of trends, is the way we should be looking at it really is, is that the pricing is kind of flat and volume is up low single digits? Is that the correct way to look at it? 
Michael Rapino: Pricing on average ticket price, you mean? 
Benjamin Mogil: Yes. 
Michael Rapino: I mean in general, you can say yes. I mean, probably net overall, there might be a few pennies on overall average ticket price, history would say. But we don't expect any of our -- any revenue coming so much from the ticket prices going up. Now we might dynamically price it better and get some of the overall ticket revenue increase from the higher end of the market. But in our assumptions, we would believe that both ticketing industry and concerts look to be able to end this year in single-digit growth, when we were probably predicting a flat year. 
Benjamin Mogil: That's great. And then sort of the one quick follow-up. If you took the -- if you take the year-end deferred revenue balance and you strip out the impact of the Olympics, but then you add in the January -- the strong $87 million in January, are you running about flat, call it, January of '12 versus December of '10? 
Elizabeth Willard: Yes. I mean, yes, that's the right answer. Flat to slightly up based on what we saw in January. 
Benjamin Mogil: And even excluding the impact of the deferred Olympics? 
Elizabeth Willard: I mean, remember that's not significant because most of those earnings were recognized in '11. So it's really... 
Benjamin Mogil: The Olympics don't show up as a deferred revenue account for you? 
Elizabeth Willard: No, it's not substantial because we were recognizing those fees as we've delivered our service. 
Michael Rapino: Remember, it's not a concert. It's a ticket. 
Benjamin Mogil: Yes, of course. Of course. But are you not withholding the -- you don't hold the cash on behalf of the Olympics for the event, or that goes right back to them. 
Elizabeth Willard: No, it's turned over fairly regularly, just like most of our venue clients. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Evercore. 
Douglas Arthur: Yes, Kathy, I'm wondering if you can be a little bit more specific on the increase in corporate expense. You mentioned litigation and incentive comp. I mean, litigation was a fairly significant factor in Q3. Was it as significant in Q4? 
Elizabeth Willard: No, it's not the same impact. It's still a substantial number, and these are not -- it's not a settlement accrual like we did in Q3. It's ongoing litigation cost for that particular case is getting -- heating up. It was pretty much dormant in 2010, and so we're incurring those costs in -- more of those costs in 2011. 
Douglas Arthur: And should that be expected again in Q1? 
Elizabeth Willard: Yes. I mean, you can see more of the details in the K, but that case will be continuing through 2012 and the future. 
Douglas Arthur: Okay. And then just a question on e-commerce profitability in the quarter. Big revenue growth, flattish AOI, anything in -- specifically there? 
Elizabeth Willard: Again, that's more along the lines of the investment in the social and mobile platforms. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Bishop Cheen with Wells Fargo. 
Bishop Cheen: So we covered litigation cost. Growing competition in the ticket distribution and services business, and without asking specifically about any incumbent or would-be competitor, can you just give us your thoughts and color on what you think the competitive landscape looks like going forward? 
Michael Rapino: Well, I can -- we'll have to use 2011 as a basis to answer that. I think there was concern 12 to 18 months ago about Ticketmaster's ability in this evolving technology landscape to continue to compete. And we know -- and I think we hopefully put a lot of that to rest right now with a 102% renewal rate. So I would say that we're always humble, we're always waking up every day paranoid, we're making sure we're equipped to handle the future, but we think that what we're doing with master [ph] and what that team has done over the last year of injecting a new life into that great platform, that we're very, very confident we will continue to maintain our leadership position on the ticketing side, from a technology side as we start to roll out our apps, our mobile kind of extensions in that business. We think that's going to continue to grow and excel that business. So as we're holding on to the overall business and spending and reinvesting in our core technology, we're very confident that between now and our new technology rolling out over the next 2 years, that we will continue to be by far the innovator and the leader in this space and our scale will continually be a competitive advantage to us. 
Bishop Cheen: Fair enough. Housekeeping question. You expect to file the 10-K by when? 
Elizabeth Willard: It will be -- it's being filed today, if it hasn't already. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. 
John Healy: I wanted to ask a little bit more about the rollout of dynamic pricing. Michael, maybe you could kind of walk us through the process that, that has to go through with getting the artist sign-off on that? And as we close the year, how many venues actually had it this year? And what do you expect for 2012? 
Michael Rapino: Well, a few questions. On dynamic pricing, we look at it in a few ways, but let's call it the most important way, which is the Pricemaster tool, which is our joint venture with MarketShare that powers that world-class technology. As we have mentioned in earlier calls, we spent 2011 finalizing that technology, the interface, making it very easy for anyone to use. I mean the UI is incredibly simple for a venue manager, promoter or manager to use. So '11 was about getting it developed, testing it, and we tested it amongst sports teams and concert venues with great success, both in the interaction of it and the end result. So we're looking in 2012, obviously, it's always easier to get adoption in-house. So it's easier for us to walk across the street, educate all of our promoters on this incredible tool and get them in their hands and on the computer using and selling it for 2012 concert season. So most of our promoters have been through all the training, understand the tool, can easily sell it now when they're talking to the artist about their summer season. And obviously, because the artist controls the ticket price in the end, it's a conversation with the artist to make sure that they're comfortable having an ongoing, scalable, flexing ticket price that's matching market demand. And we've had a great success, I think. I don't know if Irving is still on, but I know he's talked about it publicly before, that his roster of artists all understand and support the concept. So we're very excited that 100 shows already have artist approval, and we'll be testing our dynamic pricing fairly deeply on the concert side this year. 
Operator: And there are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Rapino for closing remarks. 
Michael Rapino: Great. Thank you, everybody, and we look forward to talking to you in May.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Rapino, Chief Executive Officer. Sir you may begin your conference. 
Michael Rapino:  Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our 2009 second quarter conference call. I am joined today by our CFO, Kathy Willard.  Our second quarter results were largely in line with our internal expectations and despite the global economic downturn we are executing on strategy and remain on track to achieve our primary goals; generate growth from our core business and increase our adjusted operating income for the year.  We have entered into the third quarter, the most important period of the year representing 40% of our annual contribution margin. In comparison, Q1 and Q2 combined equal 40%. We are heading into Q3 with considerable momentum. Our deferred revenue from tickets sold to date for upcoming summer events and our in venue spending highlights the underlying strengths of our business going into our peak concert season. We are putting fans in seats and we are monetizing our platform.  As we discussed in our last call, we plan to generate growth in 2009 through three primary labors. First, we will grow international adjusted operating income through our 2008 investment in O2 Dublin, increased sponsorship and a strong stadium line up.  Second, we will increase per head spend on site in our North American amphitheaters with simplified menu selection, increased point of sale, focus on hawking and increasing attendance. Third, we will drive attendance in North America through aggressive fan focused promotions.  We also look to decrease show count in North America as we approach the tough economic times with a more disciplined risk/reward buying strategy. We are offsetting these increases by a slight decrease in sponsorship and a reduction in North American ticket sales. Given current trends and visibility into the third quarter we continue to believe that we will grow our adjusted operating income for the fourth straight year.  Let me give you an update on the four main drivers of our core business; ticket sales, on site revenue, sponsorship and e-commerce ticket fees. As far as ticket sales and concerts, ticket sales during the quarter experienced a decrease of 2.5%. Through June 2009 we sold 16.3 million tickets for events in June of this year. These sales exceeded our plan for that period by 1 million tickets. Across our global concerts we have sold 83% of our total planned tickets for the year as compared to 77% for the same time in 2008.  Concerts. We had expected the North American concerts to be down since we had increased concert activity last year. Our total number of global events was down 2% for the second quarter with international music up 19% and North American down 11%. Pollstar reported industry mid-year data showing total industry events were down 11.2% for six months so we are pacing ahead of the industry.  Overall, for the quarter our revenue per fan was $78.16 compared to $81.82 in the second quarter of last year. The drop of 4.5 is all because of declines in our revenue due to currency changes. On a constant currency basis our 2009 revenue per fan would have been $84.24, an increase of 3%.  Looking ahead, our concert pipeline is very active and we are pacing ahead of last year as indicated by the $894 million in deferred revenue on our balance sheet as of June 30th, a 14% increase over last year. We currently expect to end the year with international music ticket sales up around 6% year-over-year and North America is expected to decline by around 13%.  We have a strong line up for the third quarter including U2, Madonna, Jay-Z and Nickelback, all four of our 360 deal artists. U2’s current 360 tour is on track to sell 3 million tickets worldwide. Madonna extended her record breaking tour and by the end of the year we expect to sell another 1.2 million tickets. Nickelback has sold over one million tickets so far in 2009. In addition to that we have strong acts such as No Doubt. Phish, Blink 182, AC/DC, Cold Play, Depeche Mode, Tobey Keith, Rascal Flats, Kid Rock and Jonas Brothers among others.  Despite the economy the fans are coming out and we have seen a dramatic impact from our successful value priced ticket programs. In June we launched our no service fee Wednesdays to wide acclaim. Demand surged as reflected by our increased ticket sales. We have now sold over 600,000 tickets via these promotions this year. These sales represent an increase of 90% compared to historic Wednesday volumes. We believe our summer discount programs have shown a commitment to serving fans while expanding the recognition of Livenation.com.  Our second driver is on site spending. One of the core strategies in 2009 is to drive in venue spending in North America. With the reduced attendance expected throughout the year in North America we knew driving more dollars from each fan was key to supporting our growth for the full year. In North America, our in venue ancillary revenue per head in amphitheaters grew 3.5% this quarter. We are achieving this growth in two ways. First, through higher margins from our food and beverage operations as a result of our new concession deal with SMG Aramark.  Second, we are driving per head spend through a host of new onsite initiatives including the reducing of number of items offered, focusing on more popular items and profitable items, increasing point of sale, portable hawking to sell food and beverages directly to our patrons in their seats and adding new products like souvenir photos, early access passes and bundling to create incremental revenue.  Our third driver is sponsorship. During the quarter our sponsorship revenue recognized held flat with last year. Through the first six months of 2009 sponsor revenue is up 5% over the prior year and average revenue per sponsor is up 14%. Amazing numbers given the tough economic times for the advertising market. As we previously stated, we believe sponsorship is the biggest challenge we have in 2009 given the broader advertising downturn. With the extremely challenging environment we are pleased with these results to date.  Our final driver is our e-commerce ticket business. Consumer traffic to our website continues to increase and to date we have sold 9.1 million fee bearing tickets to over 3,000 shows since our launch in December 2008. Our e-commerce division is focusing on ways to generate increasing awareness of our shows, increased sales, up sell and form direct relationships with our concert fans. We are very pleased on how our website has developed. We have been selling tickets for almost seven months and have already made terrific progress in establishing Livenation.com as a consumer destination.  Millions of fans now identify our brand and are visiting our site to buy tickets, learn about their favorite artists and purchase merchandise. Through June 30th, monthly unique visitors to Livenation.com had increased 52% compared to the first six months of 2008. For the month of June we had 6.6 million unique visitors, up 61% from June of 2008.  In addition, Lifenation.com was named the seventh most visited online music website in June by Nielsen. As stated previously, the launch of our ticketing business will build upon our e-commerce capability, complete our integrated platform and strengthen our growth profile. Our primary operating goal of 2009 was to ensure our ticketing function launched smoothly. In the year ahead we are focused on further improving our website and strengthening the service and experience we provide to fans.  The second overall strategic priority is to maximize our cash flow. Our second priority this year is to maximize our cash flow with the goal of de-leveraging our balance sheet over time. We spent the last three years building our integrated platform and with all the pieces in place we have essentially transitioned to running the core more effectively while reducing our capital expenditures.  During the quarter in North American music, our average operating cost per attendee decreased 13% and the average marketing cost per attendee declined by 20% at all promoted events resulting primarily from our cost saving initiatives. We believe that our cost management efforts combined with our new revenue streams will result in higher adjusted operating income for 2009 as well as provide improvement in our free cash flow from operations.  Turning to capital expenditures, we remain on track to reduce our CapEx in 2009 by 70% to approximately $55 million, a significant decline from our $187 million in 2008. We also expect that our debt reduction efforts will be supported by the proceeds from the sale of our remaining non-core assets. We announced last quarter that we had entered into an agreement to sell our interest in the Boston Opera House for a total of $22.5 million plus an [earn out]. We are also exploring the sale of our U.K. theaters as well as some other non-core real estate holdings.  With or without these sales we believe we are well positioned in the year ahead to continue to reduce our debt to strengthen our financial profile.  To conclude, our second quarter results were in line with our internal expectations. We remain on track toward growing our business in 2009. In the current peak concert season, business trends remained healthy as demonstrated by our deferred revenue, ticket sales pacing and success in driving increased per head spend in our venues. The fans are coming out as a result of our strong artist pipeline as well as our success in generating awareness for the shows and driving value priced programs to our fans in this tough economic time.  At the same time we are driving further efficiencies across our platform and we have taken a disciplined approach to managing our business. As a result, we continue to expect to drive growth in our adjusted operating income and cash flows in 2009.  Finally, we continue to expect to close our merger with Ticketmaster in the fourth quarter. Upon closing we believe the combined company will accelerate the execution of our vision and strategy of building an artist direct company that provides a full service connection between the artist and fans and we believe this combination will provide us with significant strategic and financial benefits.  I will now turn it over to Kathy for a financial update. 
Kathy Willard :  Thank you Michael. Good afternoon and thank you everyone for joining us. During the second quarter consolidated revenue was $1.1 billion which was down $66.7 million compared to revenue in the same period last year primarily due to a decline of $86.3 million from foreign exchange movements, mostly in international music. On a constant currency basis revenue would have been up 1.7% over the second quarter of last year.  Positive revenue impacts included an increase of $26.8 million related to acquisitions in North American music and International music and $12.9 million in ticketing due to higher revenue from service charges due to the launch of our ticketing platform. Adjusted operating income was $51.2 million during the second quarter of 2009 compared with $63.2 million during the second quarter of 2008. This decrease was due to a decline of $7.6 million from foreign exchange movement and a $19.8 million decrease in North American music driven by a reduction in the overall number of events.  We also had positive changes in adjust operating income including a $6.3 million increase in International music driven by strong promotions and festival results along with the re-opening of the O2 Dublin along with $4.5 million in ticketing due to higher net revenue from ticket service charges.  Our operating loss in the second quarter was $3.4 million compared to operating income of $27.8 million in the second quarter of 2008. Our operating loss was impacted by $14.9 million of acquisition transaction expenses related to our pending merger with Ticketmaster due to a change in the accounting rules related to business combinations.  In addition, our operating income decline was driven by $3.9 million of increased depreciation and amortization expenses related to several of our capital investments from last year along with the overall decrease in adjusted operating income.  Our net loss was $27.2 million as compared to a net loss of $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2008. These results for 2009 were impacted by the decreased operating income including the transaction expenses previously discussed. For the first six months of 2009 consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion which was down $100 million compared to revenue of $1.7 billion in the same period last year. This decrease was due to a decline of $134.9 million from foreign exchange movement, primarily International music. On a constant currency basis revenue would have been up 2.1% over the prior year.  Positive revenue impacts include an increase of $38 million related to acquisitions in North American music and international music, a $22.2 million increase in international music due to stronger promotions and improved festival activity and a $17.3 million increase in ticketing revenue due to service charges and ticketing related sponsorship revenue.  Adjusted operating income was $16.6 million during the first six months of 2009 compared to $32 million during the same period in 2008. This decrease was due to a decline of $8.9 million for foreign exchange movement and a $22.4 million decrease in North American music driven by a reduction in the overall number of events and attendance.  We also had positive growth in adjusted operating income in the first six months from a $9.9 million increase in international music due to strong promotions and festival results along with the reopening of the O2 Dublin and a $2.1 million increase in ticketing from higher service charge revenue and ticketing related sponsorship.  Our operating loss for the first six months of 2009 was $87.9 million compared to an operating loss of $42.5 million in the first six months of last year. This year-over-year decline was driven primarily by $18.7 million of acquisition transaction expenses most of which related to our pending merger with Ticketmaster. It was also impacted by the decreased adjusted operating income and increased depreciation and amortization expenses of $13 million related to several of our capital investments from last year along with an impairment for an asset we are selling as discussed last quarter.  Our net loss for the first six months of 2009 was $129.9 million as compared to a net loss of $37.9 million last year. The net results for 2009 were impacted by the increased operating loss including the transaction expenses while the results for last year benefited from $28.9 million from income from discontinued operations net of tax for the businesses we sold last year.  Our other key financial information is as follows: As of June 30th our cash and cash equivalents balance was $469.8 million. Our free cash, which is essentially cash less event related items, was a negative $91.7 million as compared to a negative $83.1 million for the same period in 2008. As you know, we generally receive cash related to ticket revenues at our owned and operated venues in advance of events which is reported in deferred revenue until the event occurs.  At June 30 our deferred revenue was $894.1 million as compared to $782.3 million at June 30, 2008, a 14% increase year-over-year. This increase was driven by the amount of ticket sales for future shows as of the end of the second quarter. Of this increased deferred revenue, only $13.5 million is related to service charges we have received but haven’t yet recognized due to selling our own tickets in 2009.  Total CapEx for the first six months of 2009 were $24.7 million compared to a total of $76.1 million during the first six months of 2008. For the six month period in 2009 we have incurred $8.7 million in maintenance expenditures and $16 million related to revenue generating projects. We continue to expect total CapEx to decrease significantly in 2009 to approximately $55 million for the year as compared to a total CapEx of $187 million during 2008.  Free cash flow was $23 million for the second quarter of 2009 compared to $31.2 million for the same period in 2008. We currently expect that free cash flow will be positive for 2009 exceeding last year’s free cash flow adjusted for discontinued operations. Moving into 2010 we currently expect to outperform our 2009 free cash flow results based on our current asset mix as we see further gains from our core business.  In addition, we anticipate seeing further benefits from the recoupment of payments under our 360 deals in 2010. As of June 30, 2009 our total long-term debt including our outstanding redeemable preferred stock was $831.5 million compared to total long-term debt of $864.1 million as of December 31, 2008, a decrease of $32.6 million. As we have previously stated we have no significant debt maturities under our primary debt instruments until June 2012. We continue to remain comfortably in compliance with all of our debt covenants.  We continue to selectively divest non-core assets and are currently exploring strategic options for our remaining theater assets in New York and the United Kingdom. We continue to focus on our debt as we look to earnings growth, continue cost controls both in terms of expenses and capital expenditures and these potential sales in non-strategic assets to provide the means to de-leverage our balance sheet and put us in a position to ultimately refinance as a standalone company or in a merger with Ticketmaster.  Finally, we currently believe we will deliver adjusted operating income growth in the high single digits for the full year 2009. Considering the economy’s impact on sponsors and other media company results we are encouraged to be able to be in this position to show positive growth over the prior year.  I will now open the call up for questions. Operator?
 :
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: In terms of sponsorship I know in the past you have talked about you did 172 last year and understandably would likely be down because of the environment this year and you were looking for 150 as kind of a rough target for the year. You sort of sit here at the beginning of August, is that target still achievable as far as you can tell? 
Michael Rapino :  As we said, we are mildly surprised we are flat year-over-year. We have a 12-month business in sponsorship which people kind of think it is a summer sponsorship business but most of our deals are ongoing. As we are sitting here now I think we will end up slightly below last year. We have some risk and some remaining big deals to close. We think we will get close to it. Right now in context going into the year we are not going to be in the 10%, 20% or 30% decline like most of the advertising businesses. I think we will be flat to 5% down. 
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: Flat from the 170 number last year? 
Michael Rapino :  No. There is two sponsorship numbers. There is $100 million and then there is premium seats which we calculate to get to that full 170. My premium seats are over and done with this year because they are the summer activity. The remaining number we think about as pure sponsorship is $108 million from last year. If you take the premium seats. We are tracking flat to that right now on forecast but we have to close some deals to deliver that.  I would say if you were using the number, I originally said for the year we may be $20 million down. I think we are looking better than that and will probably end up $10 million down. 
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: How did the premium, I am guessing the premium seats for the year are largely sold. How did they fare this coming in this economy?
Michael Rapino :  Again, we assume they might have been a bigger risk than they were. We would end up, again we are going to end up flat by the time we are down maybe $3-4 million down from last year. Nothing substantial. If you look at our sponsorship there is kind of an international business. Simon Lewis runs that and we are going to grow that business this year substantially. They are just having great success internationally. Mostly because it was a fairly under developed market and they have been able to get the low hanging fruit.  We have national sponsors, local sponsors and premium seats. Our premium seats…basically if you look at all three of those they are all relatively flat to maybe $3 million down each. So we didn’t have any disasters on a national deal basis, a local deal basis or a premium seat.  We just got clipped, we probably will end up getting clipped $3 million each and end up $10 million down if you add up those three. 
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: In terms of the Wednesday sales you were running, if you look at lawn ticket sales overall, how did they fare just looking at that as sort of being the more price sensitive kind of customers? From the overall summer perspective, what do you see now through Labor Day if you will? Any thoughts on how that market fared this summer? 
Michael Rapino :  Surprisingly we looked at data a hundred different ways. If you look at Pollstar's 100 Tours, if you look at the top tours versus the mid shows we haven’t found any trend yet whether it is regular priced or not where the sales were considerably down whether they are A shows, B, C, lawn seats or reserved. Generally they were flat. We knew going in this year we were going to take probably 100 less shows in our amphitheater because we said in the last quarter those extra 100 shows you chase could be winners or they could be the losers so we really wanted to go in safe this year in North America.  So to deliver the attendance we are going to deliver in amphitheaters we are going to exceed last year’s attendance if you look at per show attendee. We have sold 600,000 tickets in those service fee Wednesdays. A wild success but it is only 5% of our overall business. You couldn’t make or break the difference if your core 95% was trending down. So overall we are kind of seeing business flat and we knew doing something spectacular around promotions might gain us another 600,000-800,000 incremental tickets through the year. It would just be some icing on the cake on our amphitheater season. One of our biggest challenges would be cannibalization rates. Would they buy on Wednesday but not buy at the end? We have seen exceptionally low cannibalization rates on these Wednesday shows which has been really encouraging. 
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: I was wanting to make sure I heard you right, your deferred revenue number included if you were looking at it on a year-over-year basis included $13.5 million of service charge. Is that correct? 
Kathy Willard :  That is right. From the ticketing operation that we wouldn’t have had last year. Not our total but what would have been new. 
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: If I look at it from that perspective you are up about 12% on deferred revenue year-over-year apples-to-apples. Is that about what you are getting? 
Kathy Willard :  That is right. 
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: Did currency have an impact positive or negative? 
Kathy Willard :  Not significant. This is really you are just seeing the timing of the Q3 shows and the way the ticket sales have gone. We are up from 83% sales versus 77% last year. 
Michael Rapino :  There was no mystery in how we planned the year. We purposely knew Q2 would be slightly down from last year because it wasn’t hard to figure out when Madonna and U2 were starting a stadium tour on July 1 worldwide your Q3 revenue is going to be big. You don’t have to go for the kill in Q2 when you know you have that size of revenue coming in on July 1 in Q3. That is what is driving that business in terms of the top part. 
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: I think you have talked about that before on calls you had to look at Q2 and Q3 and deferred revenue because that kind of encapsulates the summer season if you will. Can you give us an update if you look at the LTM EBITDA from a bank perspective and sum up the 150 in cash you were allotted to [sub out] what number are you at from a covenants perspective? 
Kathy Willard :  I won’t give you an exact number. You can do the top level math. We are definitely very comfortable with where we are not only in Q2 but for the rest of the year. 
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: Do all sort of the one-time charges from Ticketmaster from the proposed merger get factored into calculations or not? 
Kathy Willard :  No, we add those back so they are not an impact to debt covenants. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph. 
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph: Can you elaborate on who you think you capitalize in 2010 on the 360 deals with ? The artists in particular? 
Kathy Willard :  Several of them. The one that is different is Shakira will be out on tour for the first time. U2 will be continuing their tour. Those are the two biggest ones. 
Michael Rapino :  And Jay-Z will have a record out. 
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph: Given the tough economic times have artist expectations changed at all? Are you able to negotiate maybe more favorable terms with them? Then exactly how do the economics work when you cut the price in half since that is the artists’ bread and butter? Are they willing to take a pay cut on that? Do you have to compromise or something else? How does that work exactly?
Michael Rapino :  On the first question, unfortunately the answer is no. You can see our talent costs. The good news is the last couple of years our talent cost to revenue has remained fairly flat. There hasn't been any increase. When you are an artist that can demand ticket sales you are going out expecting to get paid what you have always gotten paid. So we have not had any success in artists reducing their cost structure given the economic times. 
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph: But if you are running less shows and I assume some of your competitors are running less shows, wouldn’t that law of supply and demand help you a little bit in the equation? Maybe with the weaker artists? 
Michael Rapino :  With the weaker, yes. We hope that this year and onward the artists, agents, managers and everyone starts to realize it is not healthy for the industry for the ticket prices to increase. We know that ticket prices are a main issue on consumers coming to shows. We know in order to sell those 40% of unsold tickets we as an industry have to be smarter on our pricing. Some managers and some artists are more proactive and understand it and think through it. Some don’t. Overall, the overall economics of the percentage of guarantee versus revenue hasn’t shifted. We would hope that over time all promoters and others figure a way to bring the prices down.  As far as the promotion, it is a combination. A lot of what we did was the no service fee. So we took that service fee and took it right off our bottom line. That didn’t affect the band because they still got the face value of the ticket. Now again, why would we do that? If we can give away a $5 service fee in contribution margin but get one incremental person through our amphitheater that spends $15 on ancillary it is a good trade off for us.  So going back to the first part it is all about if it was incremental and what your cannibalization rate was. In this case we put 600,000 people through the door. We have not done our assessment and analysis complete for the year but we are talking somewhere around a 30% cannibalization rate and 70% incremental ticket rate. The math works for us. Whether the artist participates or not at what point can you drive new customers in to buy on site?  In some cases the four-packs, six-packs and two-for-one’s artists do participate. If the show has been on sale for a month and the artist and promoter know you are only going to sell another 2,000 seats but if you could put 4,000 in lets all take a slight reduction on the gross. Most bands are very proactive in understanding more people in will mean some level of price promotion especially this year. So they have participated in that end. 
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph: Can you talk about how you are doing on the ticketing initiative? I know you gave detailed numbers at your analyst day a few years ago. Are you going to hit those numbers for 2009 and for 2010? 
Kathy Willard :  The 2008 numbers weren’t quite big of a loss as we expected them to be. 2009 is not quite the same. So a little bit of a loss, about a $30 million movement when we did the original back in January of 2008. It is probably closer to $20-25 million, closer to $25 million mark this year as far as swing. 2010 is really going to depend on North American ticket sales. So I don’t really have better data for you on that right now. 
Michael Rapino :  The biggest challenge from day one would it work. Would we sell tickets. Could we handle the load. Could we get our summer season up without any issues. Remember back in October the world was debating would it work. So one of the most important piece that is accomplishment for us, our biggest strategic priority of the year was could we sell 10 million plus tickets on a platform without any consumer issues. We are at 9.1. We haven’t had an issue since early January with Phish.  Nathan Hubbard and the team have done a great job of seamlessly selling lots of concert tickets. You can imagine these Wednesdays have been a heck of an experiment on our load and we have handled those Wednesday on sales perfectly.  Executionally we have been delivering. As far as the revenue generated we haven’t had to over staff any more than planned or fix or lower than we had planned overall. We are running at basically the amount of people we need. The fixed cost structure is about the same as we had expected. We are charging the same service fee to the fan as expected. Net/net our efficiency is running it and also monetizing it is 90% on plan you could say. 
Kathy Willard :  Remember ticketing recognizes their revenue just the same as North American music does. It is when the events happen so most of that will also be in Q3. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: First, as you have been divesting assets over the last couple of years can you talk about how your return has changed and what the plan is over I guess sans merger with a focus on returns and how you see that improving over the next couple of years. Then the drivers or the differences in the attendance trends internationally versus domestically or North America, is that just pure content based?
Kathy Willard :  In terms of the return on our asset sales we are still seeing obviously they are strategic sales for us so the ones we have out there in the U.K. theaters and potentially the New York theater, we are expecting very accretive returns. So we really aren’t seeing the impacts of that. Obviously those are strategic buyers that are involved in that. 
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: And the differences in attendance trends? 
Michael Rapino :  Two fold. One in Europe, Madonna is touring Europe, not America. Two, festivals have been very successful this year in Europe. They are having a really strong year in the festival market. Festivals are the amphitheaters of Europe for us so when they are strong our business is strong. Three, U2 is starting in Europe for Q3 and will be here in the fall.  So those are the three that would drive international. North America we have U2 coming in the fourth quarter and we purposely, as I said, went into the year not trying to break the show count of last year and purposely kind of dialed down our aggression on how many shows we would fill the amphitheater with for good economic risk. So we went in this year knowing that North America didn’t have to over-deliver and that Europe would and we didn’t have to take that unnecessary risk on some tours and some shows that could have been a negative on us. 
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: I remember last year there as an increased focus on bringing more festivals to North America. What was the lesson learned from that and is that something you are continuing this year? 
Michael Rapino :  We like to fail fast. We did one in Vancouver that didn’t produce the returns we wanted. We lost a couple of million dollars. Also last year it seemed to be the strategy of the year because every promoter tried a festival last year and very few succeeded. We decided again with the economic crisis back in October and planning season we decided to shut down any risky capital initiatives around launching new festivals in North America in 2009.  From the looks of it, there are a few established festivals that do great; Lollapalooza, Bonaroo and Coachella. Other than that, the North American market there are a lot of festivals that are out there are just not succeeding. So, we are not robust on the idea that festivals are a growth opportunity in North America. 
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: You just talked to the actual logistics or issues or hurdles you see in terms of flipping the switch on House of Blues and the international ticketing at the end of this year, like lessons learned. What did you learn this year in North America? Obviously you mentioned Phish. Are there any significant or different things you need to think about with respect to turning on the rest of the network?
Michael Rapino :  No, I think we have a software platform from CTS. It is technology. We have an ongoing relationship with them. Week by week we are demanding more and more from the system. Week by week Germany is adjusting and trying to make it better and better. So we have had a year of learning and we have a long way to go still to becoming a top notch technology company.  It works. It sells tickets. The biggest part we learned is the real fruit from the exercise comes from your e-commerce store front and your dynamic pricing. This no service fees was just continual testing around the dynamic pricing that says can we motivate purchase. We found two pieces of information in research this year that just drives everything we do. 60% of our fans said they would have went to the show but they didn’t hear about it. 40% of our inventory is unsold.  We think there are millions of dollars of upside if we can; one, get to the fan more efficiently and effect some of those 60 that want to come. Then through dynamic pricing chip away at that 40% unsold.  So the lessons really are just around how do you become a great e-commerce website to motivate purchase, give a better experience and that learning. The bottom line platform called CTS is a software that works good enough and we will continue to innovate it but we don’t see any fundamental problems in adding more to it. 
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: Have you seen any differences in the secondary ticketing market with respect to what you are seeing on your website? 
 Michael Rapino :  We don’t really have any secondary business right now. We decided this year is not the year we are going to try and figure that piece out. I have read the different reports from Stub Hub and others who it looks like business is still healthy on their end on the top end of the site. We haven’t seen any new insight either way that would suggest the business is growing or declining.  It looks pretty stable. That business at the end of the day is the big cities, big tours and great seats can demand a great premium. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of David Joyce – Miller Tabak.
David Joyce – Miller Tabak: Can you discuss how your Latin American partnership has been panning out according to your original expectations and what sort of impact that would have had in the second quarter proportionate to deferred revenue? What other territories would you consider looking into in the future? 
Michael Rapino :  Our partner, CIE, is a great partner. As everyone would know it wasn’t the best year to be a promoter in Mexico with swine flu and others. This year we had a great success by bringing Madonna into South America last year. Basically since January the Mexican business has been shut closed for business on a concert perspective.  It is now heating back up and we have some stadium shows planned. We will continue to move forward. We have no real impact on deferred revenue. It is not a big enough piece of business. That strategic relationship is about having that distribution pipe when you have shows like Madonna or the Jonas Brothers. When you are promoting in Brazil, Mexico or Chile you are now not just selling off the show but you are actually participating in the local revenue. It is new revenue to us but at the end of the day Latin America in general is a $5-7 million EBITDA business a year. It is not a big piece of business right now.  Europe is doing really well. As far as expansion we are continually looking at Australia, Japan and Germany. Those are the big markets we really don’t have any presence in that we would like to find a right way to get to at the right cost one day. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Alan Gould – Natixis
Alan Gould – Natixis: It has been a couple of years now since you started these 360 deals. You have had Madonna, Nickelback and I guess U2 all on the road. How have they performed relative to your expectations in the first year or two of those deals? 
Michael Rapino :  They have exceeded our original plan. As you remember when we signed Madonna there was a lot of debate on how big she was touring, what her age was, would she tour. She went out and broke all history records with the largest tour in history from a solo artist. We had not planned on it being that big. That over delivered on our return. Jay-Z toured and sold out every arena. That again we didn’t have 100% sell out in there. So that worked.  Nickelback is just dead on plan. We knew they were a sleeper and a big band and selling one million tickets right now is unheard of in today’s economy. Then U2, we always believe they are going to be as big and as long as they want. We have thought this tour when we did that deal did we know they were going to do a worldwide stadium tour? No. So we would have never built into a plan that aggressive scaling in size. So U2 will over deliver completely on our original plan.  The easy part of those deals we believed from our history those would be strong touring acts and having them under contract would benefit us. It has. It kept the price of talent down and they have all over performed. Then the real test will come when our first real album comes out that we have to do some level of distribution on.  We have our first Jay-Z album we have outsourced that to Warner Records. Again, we always said when we took these over the cost of the album was the marginal small part of the overall deal and we don’t plan on building infrastructure and cost structure to become a distributor. We are finding there are a lot of distributors who want the Jay-Z, Madonna and Nickelback records. So we are pretty confident we will be able to find our returns on the record by outsourcing that. 
Alan Gould – Natixis: How are the other ancillary businesses gone? Have they also out performed like the tours have? The merchandise, etc.? 
Michael Rapino :  Yes. Most of our deals are all tour related. At the end of the day if you sell the tickets, the fan site works, the membership works, the merchandise works, the sponsorship works. The Blackberry sponsorship on U2 over delivered. Shakira will be coming up this year. We believe she will be a gigantic star worldwide again. The business has over delivered on all of those pieces given the size of the ticket sales. 
Alan Gould – Natixis: I missed the first part of the call if this was already asked, how is sponsorship going given the softness in overall advertising and the economy? 
Michael Rapino :  We did cover it but just a summary, given the trends of advertising down the 15-30% depending on which medium we are tracking flat right now year-over-year which we are surprised by honestly. We don’t know if that will hold through the rest of the year so we are building our plan to assume that sponsorship will be down somewhere in the range of 5% year-over-year is how we built our plan. We originally built it being down about 10% but we are feeling at this point that we may finish the year only 5% down. 
Alan Gould – Natixis: Did you lower the guidance to high single digits as opposed to low double digits? 
Kathy Willard :  That is correct. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Reed Walker – [Avascent Group]. 
Reed Walker – [Avascent Group]: Any update on the merger? I saw the notice and there is no questions yet.
Michael Rapino :  Nothing. We are in the usual process of the DOJ. We are moving on that. The S4 we will finalize soon. When will that go out? 
Kathy Willard :  45-60 days probably. It is out on Amendment 1 but still not effective. 
Reed Walker – [Avascent Group]: Still 45-60 days. Has there been a second request for data? 
Michael Rapino :  Oh yes. We did that back in March. We are on full second review. Everything is going…I can say we are very confident and optimistic still that we will close this in the fourth quarter and the DOJ when it is all said and done we will see the benefits of the output. 
Operator:  There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Michael Rapino :  Thank you everybody. We will talk to you in Q3. 
Operator:  This concludes Live Nation’s second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Rapino, Chief Executive Officer.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our 2009 first quarter conference call. I'm joined today by my CFO Cathy Willard. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations on our key metrics that indicate that we are on track to deliver our 2009 plan. Our first quarter is historically the slowest period of the year but an important time as it provides a window into how the full year will end up. While the quarter results themselves are not a significant factor in the final year results, we believe they are key metrics of deferred revenue from tickets sold in the quarter for the summer events, in venue spending and sponsorship are three trends that are very positive for this quarter that indicate a strong summer. Overall we are very optimistic about the full year given the strengths of these three core metrics in Q1. Despite the challenges other media entertainment companies are having in 2009, we have built our 2009 plan to deliver growth and adjusted operating income. We plan to realize this growth through three levers. The first is new operating income from our 2008 investments in the Point in Ireland and two new House of Blues in Boston and Houston. Second, we will increase international ticket sales and three, we'll increase per head spend on site in our North America amphitheaters. Fourth, we had planned on offsetting these increases by a slight reduction in sponsorship and a reduction in North American music ticket sales netting a low double digit adjusted operating income growth overall.  To achieve growth in this economy is a testament to the resilience of the concert industry and our disciplined execution strategy. In 2009 we have two strategic priorities; deliver growth in our core business and increase cash flow.  Now let me take you through an update on the four main drivers of our core business; ticket sales, onsite revenue, sponsorship and ticket fees. First is ticket sales. During the quarter we delivered what we had planned. International music attendance was up 17% and North America was down 22% for a net concert decline of 10%. We had planned and assumed North American concerts would be down slightly since we had increase concert attendance last year dramatically. Our total number of events was essentially flat with international music up and North America music down. Looking ahead, our concert pipeline is robust and on pace ahead of last year as indicated by the nearly $700 million in our balance sheet in deferred revenue as of March 31, a 24% increase from last year. Due to our strong April sales, current ticket sales as of to date are at a pace in line with last year, so we have made up any of the gap from our Q1 decline. So there is no doubt the fans are continuing to come out to shows as we anticipated. We have a very strong line up this year. U2's 360 Tour has generated incredible demand, selling 2.5 million tickets. Madonna's extended leg in Europe has been another sell out smash and artists such as Nickleback, AC/DC, Coldplay, Aerosmith, Jimmy Buffet and the Jonas Brothers are well on track to sell out some strong shows. To stimulate incremental sales in North America amphitheaters we are executing multiple promotions to provide value and provide low cost tickets for fans in this tough economy. This summer we have over 3 million lawn tickets priced under $30 and have expanded our four pack to 70% of our shows. We're also running extensive price promotions with corporate partners such as City and Seven-Eleven and working to expand the number of onsite offering tickets to affiliate programs to drive ticket sales to our site. The second lever that drives our business is onsite per head. Total revenue per attendant in the quarter was $66.48 versus $62.91 in the prior year which indicates fans are spending when they show up at the venue. In North America, our in venue ancillary revenue increased $3.06 per head compared to last year. One of our core strategies in 2009 is to drive in venue spending in North America. With the reduced attendance expected throughout the year in North America we knew driving more dollars from each fan was a key strategy. We believe we'll achieve this in two ways; first through higher margins on food and beverage that will be an outcome of our new concession deal with SMG Airmark which will increase profits by 10%. The second way we expect to drive per head is through a host of new onsite initiatives including reducing the items sold and focusing on the most popular, profitable increasing points of sale, portable hawking to sell foot and beverages directly to the patrons in their seats, and finally increasing products and adding new products like souvenirs photos, early access passes and bundling to create incremental revenue. Our third business driver is sponsorship. During the quarter, our sponsorship revenue recognized increased with our average revenue per sponsor by 103%. This follows a 14% increase in our sponsorship revenue from 2008. Our integrated live music platform continues to attract larger more profitable advertising marketing campaigns as evidenced by the Starwood partnership we announced in February as well as the new sponsorship agreements with GTI, Anheuser-Busch and Comcast. During the first quarter, total sponsorship revenue dollars was paced ahead of 2008 by 17%. No doubt we are very pleased with the progress we are making in growing this portion of the business. However, despite these healthy trends we continue to believe sponsorship is the one big challenge we have in 2009 given the broader advertising downturn. The fourth lever of our profit is ticket fees executed through Livenation.com. Consumer traffic to our website continues to increase and to date we have sold over 6 million to over 2,300 shows since our launch in December, including 5.8 million tickets sold in the first four months of 2009. Our ecommerce division is focused on ways to increase sales, up sell and for direct relationships with our concert fans. Our second priority this year is to maximize our cash flow with the goal of deleveraging our balance sheet over time. We spent the last three years building our integrated platform. With all the pieces now in place, we've essentially transitioned to run the core more effectively and reducing our capital expenditures. During the quarter our consolidated direct operating expenses declined 6.5% and our consolidated fixed costs 4.6%. Our direct operating expenses for North America music along declined 4% and our average profit per show rose 10%. We believe that these operational benefits, when added to our new revenue streams will result not only in higher adjusted operating income for 2009 but also substantial improvements in our free cash flow from operations. Turning to capital expenditures, we remain on tract to decrease our total CapEx in 2009 by 70% to approximately $55 million, a significant decline from the $187 million we spent in 2008. Our debt reduction efforts will be supported by the proceeds of the sale of our remaining on core assets.  We recently entered into an agreement to sell our interest in Boston Opera House, in Boston for a total consideration of $22.5 million plus an earn out. We are also exploring the sale of our U.K. theaters as well as some of our other non core real estate holdings. With or without the additional sales we believe that we'll be well positioned in 2009 and beyond to meaningfully reduce our debt and strengthen our financial profile. To conclude, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflect the season's slowest period of the year for us. We have now entered the busiest season of concerts and top line trends remain healthy as demonstrated by our deferred revenue, concert ticket sell pacing, per head spend and sponsorship. We are driving further efficiencies across our platform and we're operating with very sharp discipline this year. As a result, we currently expect to drive strong free cash flow in 2009 and believe this will allow us to reduce our debt and strengthen our financial profile. Finally, as you are aware in February we announced and entered into a merger with Ticketmaster Entertainment. Upon closing, we believe that the combined company will accelerate the execution of our vision and strategy to build an artist direct company that provides a full service connection between the artists and fans.  We believe the combination will provide us with significant strategic and financial benefits and we continue to work hard to close this merger. We still expect we will close in the third or fourth quarter of the year.  And now, I'll turn it over to Cathy for the financial outlook.
Elizabeth Willard: Good afternoon and thank you everyone for joining us. Before reviewing our results for the first quarter, I want to highlight the beginning of 2009 we have changed our reportable segments. Our reportable segments are now North American Music, International Music and Ticketing. Prior to 2009 we also report an Artists Nation segment which historically recorded global tours and providing other services to artist with events occurring both domestically and internationally. We are now allocating these activities to our North American Music and International Music segments based on where the profits are being generated. This change has been made to reflect how we are now managing our business. Now to our results. During the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $499.3 million which was down $33.4 million driven by foreign currency movements as compared to revenues of $532.7 million in the same period last year. This revenue decline was due to the impact of $48.6 million in negative foreign exchange movement primarily in International Music. On a constant currency basis revenues would have been $547.9 million during the first quarter a 3% increase over last year. Positive revenue impacts included an increase of $11.1 million related to acquisitions, primarily in International Music and $17.2 million in International Music due to increased promotion activity. Adjusted operating loss was $34.4 million during the first quarter of 2009 compared to a loss of $31.4 million during the first quarter of 2008. This increase loss was due to a $1.2 million decline related to negative foreign exchange movement and a $2.3 million decline in our Ticketing segment driven by increased costs as we were beginning development of our Ticketing platform in the first quarter of last year and therefore were not operating at a full cost base as compared to being at full operations during the first quarter of 2009, and also due to the impact of the timing of revenue recognition as ticket service charge revenue is not recognized until the event takes place regardless of when the ticket is sold. We had offsetting positive movements in adjusted operating income through a $4.7 million improvement in International Music driven by the results of strong arena, theater and stadium events. Our operating loss in the first quarter was $84.4 million compared to a loss of $70.3 million in the first quarter of 2008. This year over year decline was driven by increased depreciation and amortization expenses primarily due to a $7.7 million impairment charge related to the sale of the three Boston venues along with a slight increase in adjusted operating loss previously discussed. Also negatively impacting our operating loss was $3.8 million of acquisition transaction costs primarily related to the merger. Due to a change in accounting rules related to business combinations, costs related to completing an acquisition must now be expenses as incurred rather than capitalized as part of the purchase as we have done in the past These new rules are effective beginning in 2009. In calculating adjusted operating income the company is now adding these costs back so that the results are comparable. Our net loss was $102.7 million as compared to a net loss of $37.2 million in the first quarter of 2008. The net results for 2008 include a benefit of $31.4 million of income from discontinued operations plus $20.6 million from other tax benefits related to the gain on these discontinued operations. The other significant impacts to our net loss are the impairment charge and acquisition costs previously discussed. Turning now to other key financial information, as of March 31, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $357.1 million. Our free cash which is essentially cash less event related items was a negative $103.5 million. This negative free cash balance is due to payments made during the quarter for longer term artist advances including the May hold to Madonna to settle her start guarantee. Our negative free cash flow during the quarter which is our seasonally lowest quarter and total net debt payments primarily on the revolver and term loans of $22.7 million. As many of you know, we generally receive cash related to ticket revenues at our owned and our operated venues in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs. At March 31, 2009, our deferred revenue was $696.2 million as compared to a balance of $564.4 million at March 2008 reflecting an increase in the amount of ticket sales for future shows as of the end of the quarter. We had negative free cash flow of $51.9 million during the first quarter of 2009 which is slightly improved compared to negative free cash flow of $52.2 million in the first quarter of 2008.  Total capital expenditures during the first quarter were only $12.6 million, just over half of our total capital expenditures of $23.1 million during the first quarter of 2008. CapEx in the quarter consisted of $2.9 million in maintenance expenditures and $9.7 million related to revenue generating projects. Overall we currently expect total capital expenditures to decrease significantly in 2009 to approximately $55 million compared to total CapEx of $187 million during 2008.  As of March 31, 2009 our total long term debt including our outstanding redeemable preferred stock was $840.3 million compared to total long term debt of $864.1 million as of December 31, 2008, a decrease of $23.8 million. For 2009 the company implemented new accounting rules that changed the accounting for certain convertible debt instruments including our 2.875% convertible senior notes. Under the new rules, the company must now separately account for the liability and equity components of the debt in a manner that reflects our non convertible borrowing rate. The effect of these new rules for our notes is that the equity component which is the debt discount is included in additional capital and the debt is now recorded net of this discount which is $59.5 million as of March 2009. Also, interest expense also includes additional non cash interest as the discount is amortized. This new standard was applied retrospectively so the December balances have been restated as well. As we have previously stated we have no significant debt securities under our primary debt instrument until June 2012. We continue to remain comfortably in compliance with all of our debt covenants and also remain focused on all of our cash flow parameters. These key parameters can be broken down into three components; working capital, free cash flow and debt reduction. The working capital one benefit we have been capitalizing on in these tough economic times is around the timing of our artist advances. Historically when an artist was signed for a tour, a significant amount of the guarantee, in some instances up to 50% might have been paid at signing although the tour may not be occurring for many months into the future. We have drastically reduced this practice and are now timing advances much closer to the start of the tour and saving the payments of advances as the tour progresses. This has had a positive effect on our working capital and reduced reliance on our credit facility. We currently expect that free cash flow will be positive in 2009. After adjustment for transaction costs related to the merger, exceeding last years free cash flow adjusted for discontinued operations on a double digit basis. Free cash flow has been an important focus for us over the last two years as we have realigned our business away from non core activities and have grown our core businesses. As we have previously stated, we are at the end of our major capital investment initiatives which will reduce the use of our cash. Our free cash flow this year will be used to fund the last non payments under our All Right Shield, the make hold payment under Madonna's guarantee and revenue generating capital expenditures of approximately $35 million. After adjusting for these incremental payments and investments, our adjusted free cash flow for 2009 is still expected to be slightly positive. Moving into 2010, we current expect to substantially out perform our free cash results for 2009 based on our current asset mix as we see further gains from our investment activity. In addition, we will see further benefits from the acceleration of the recoupment of payments under our all rights deals in 2010. We recently completed a review of our debt with the rating agencies as part of the merger process. As a result of that detailed review of our projections, both S&P and Moody's have left our ratings unchanged with S&P moving us to positive watch. As we have indicated, we have entered into an agreement to sell certain assets in Boston, and 50% of those net proceeds will go against our term loans in the third quarter. From a covenant perspective we have very solid head room. Based on the visibility of our current projections for adjusted operating income, show counts and cash on hand, we easily expect to meet all covenant tests for 2009. Based on the timing of show related items, the second quarter is a tighter quarter, but it would still take a significant drop in adjusted operating income in Q2 before we even get close to a covenant threshold issue. Moving into the third and fourth quarter and looking forward from there, we expect covenant head room to have over a 20% EBITDA cushion.  Finally, based on the investments we've made over the last three years, we currently believe that we will deliver adjusted operating income growth in the low double digits for the full year in 2009 as we continue to grow our core operations and realize the impact in these investments in venues, artists and our ticketing operations. With that, I will open up the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first call comes from David Joyce – Miller Tabak.
David Joyce – Miller Tabak: Can you talk about any dynamic pricing initiatives that will drive the ticketing for the summer and secondly if you can talk about any cannibalization that took place as you moved to larger sponsors or have you maintained some smaller relationships?
Michael Rapino: I'll talk to the second first on sponsorship. No cannibalization at all. We've got a lot of sponsors, over 800 but we still think that number should be dramatically higher in the big picture so we haven't bumped into any cannibalization. We find there are basically three different type of sponsors.  There's a local sponsor that just wants a lower deal in his local market. There's a regional company that has a geography platform that maybe wants a west coast deal, and then there's a national company who's looking for a more national campaign, and those are three very distinct categories. We're keeping all of our local and regional on track and what we've just really done in the last two years is built up our national division and started to take advantage of the bigger brands that have a bigger budget for a national campaign. In terms of dynamic pricing, I wouldn't say we've made a ton of headroom yet. I think that is still the how hanging fruit that we have to get to. First as you know our priority in 2009 was become the e-commerce platform that can sell the tickets and get that job done. And after a couple of hiccups at the beginning, we're now over 6 million tickets. It's a non news event. We're selling tickets every day fast, strong and confidently. So first priority is just to get the sales pipe working, establish a relationship with the customers. We're doing some tests. No doubt Jim is a progressive manager and we priced the house very smartly versus a traditional three scale model and that's provided some great learning and increased revenue. Coldplay is giving out CD's at the concert. I would say the appetite for the artist to sit down with us now and explore all ideas on how do I sell my concert ticket differently, how do I participate in the higher end, how do I bundle, is coming to life full steam as we've just now entered into the ability to be able to do it. So we'll test some this summer but by next year this will be an ongoing change in how we sell with all of the different options.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners.
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: On sponsorship, obviously tracking up in the quarter, can you give us a sense where year to date you are in terms of sponsorship?
Michael Rapino:  We've been pretty good this year on trying to give some guidance on sponsorship to help everybody because it's the one area. To simplify our sponsorship, we built a plan this year that we end up doing about $120 million a year in sponsorship EBITDA. That's our base from last year.  We built a plan this year that said given all the news we were hearing back in November, we didn't think it would be realistic that we would match $120 million so we built a plan that said we can grow our operating income if we're down $20 million in sponsorship and hit $100 million. And I would just say to you as of right now, we are in striking distance of hitting the $100 million. Our only debate will be do we do better or are we $4 million off the budget of $100 million. But we're tracking close to the $85 million to $95 million range of that $100 million right now, so within striking distance.
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: That $100 million you're referring to is in EBITDA, am I correct?
Michael Rapino: Yes.
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: I want to understand a little bit better on the deferred revenue and the growth that we saw there. You sold 4.2 million tickets so far year to date for your ticketing system of which 2.7 was your owned and operated venues, is that correct?
Elizabeth Willard: That was as of March 31. That's correct. Michael gave more current numbers which are the six million numbers through basically today.
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: What I want to get a sense of, if you were ticketing yourself at your owned and operated venues last year, let's say a $50 average ticket price, what would last year's deferred revenue account be in March 31 or sub out what you have in the deferred revenue line at your own operated venues this year. I want to get a sense of what the change is, how you'd be doing ticketing in both years.
Elizabeth Willard: The only difference really in the way you're thinking about it is that we would have the service charge on the piece of the tickets that we're selling which we wouldn't have had last year that would have been in Ticketmaster's. But remember our deferred revenue also includes tickets sold in third party buildings too if we receive the cash. So it's not just the tickets sold through our own ticketing operations.
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: So the difference would be the ticketing surcharge, right?
Elizabeth Willard: Yes, that's really the only difference between the two. The rest is timing on sales and the amount of tickets on the events that are on sale.
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: So if that were the case should we be looking that the adjustment, I think your delta was about $130 million from year over year and maybe of that call it like $15 million to $20 million is because of the change at Ticketmaster and the rest is all growth in the business. Is that correct?
Michael Rapino: The last thing I want to do is let your inaccurate math take any of the shine off the deferred revenue story which is for most of the people who have been following the stock know that if you have that level of deferred revenue today, we sold tickets. That means the pipe is full for the summer versus last year. So I'll back you up. The deferred revenue just for everyone's clarity, last year we grew ticket sales double digits year over year, had a fabulous year in North America. So be standing today with deferred revenue ahead of last year would mean that we sold more tickets today than we did a year ago this day so that's a good indication. And you are right; there are some service fees in there. And you're right they're a very small minority piece of that upside. So in the $10 million to $15 million range is a good approximate number to use to figure out what the rest is in terms of growth.
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: I got it. The sense that you were still booking as deferred revenue even money that was held by third parties. That's why the balance sheet last year was so high in the absence of your ticketing.
Michael Rapino: That's Europe. That's stadiums. That's anywhere in the world we're selling tickets.
Ben Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners: Obviously some bands are selling well and some others, and always the case and you've obviously got a long history of knowing how different bands sell in different venues and get a sense of how to price them on the guarantee side as well. Are you seeing in any cases, do you have any flexibility in any cases with some tours that are simply not performing as you'd hoped? Do you have any kind of out or flexible clauses with artists on the guarantee to sort of the bang it down a little bit if certain thresholds aren't met?
Michael Rapino: Generally you have a contract with the band, you have a contract. But we both have the same motive. A band does not want to get on stage and have empty seats. So I would say to you that 99% of the time, if a tour goes on sale and it's not pacing well, you are sitting with the manager and agent coming up with creative ways to sell more tickets. Reduce the prices, do more promotion, excite the sale, and that end. The good news is this. The reason we planned, and that's why I don't want any of the Q1 decline in North America to come across as consumer purchase behavior versus self implied. We knew that we had a really strong year in North America last year. We know that there's a certain amount of shows we need to fill the pipe, and then some of the shows above and beyond that are the gravy that help you deliver some higher profit or sometimes bring down your profit. We went into 2009 with a very purposeful disciplined plan that said, let's not try to grow market share in North America this year. Let's go after the for sure bands, the for sure business. We'll leave a few bands on the table. We'll let Age's and others book a few that we might have historically chased harder. So we purposely went out this year to say we'll fill the pipe to the level that we know we can drive our operating income. We will not go after all and every band. We'll reduce our risk and we'll go after the more for sure bands. So we're sitting here right now and the good news I can tell, we're not sitting here right now with any tours or any shows of magnitude that are dogs, that are going to take a hit on our P&L in any big sense. We've got a pretty solid line up of superstars and downward and we're happy with the level we have right now and we don't see any big losers this year that will impact our operating income.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alan Gould – Natixis.
Alan Gould – Natixis: My question is regarding the operating income guidance of low double digits. Can we get more granular? Are we talking 10% to 15%? Is that where we're looking for?
Michael Rapino: I'd love to but historically we don't even give guidance. But we thought that given a lot of the uncertainties in the market place around the sponsorship business, I spent the first three months of the year getting the question, what if no one comes this year. Then now we've proven they're not only coming, they're coming at the same rate as last year. Then I spent the last two months saying, well what if they come and don't buy a beer. So I've now convinced you that the per heads are holding strong, and the only piece I want to be clear on is sponsorship, we built in a reduction and we'll deliver plan. And we'll build in at the end of the year; International Music will be way ahead of last year. North America could be flat to 5% down if w planned right, could end up net overall flat to 3% to 5% down. That's the attendance numbers we built into our plan to deliver a growth over our $167 million last year. So we typically don't even say we're going to grow. We don't typically give that. I think today we just wanted to give very strong signals that even in this economy, even with all the other issues that entertainment companies are having, we will grow operating income. I think we said just for clarity in the single digit growth and we were attacking the second and most important priority in this economy is generate free cash flow and de-lever. So I think the message today for all of the analysts that are building their models, we will grow the business from the $167 million and all the metrics from Q1 in isolation mean nothing when combined with deferred, sponsorship and new heads and the new data that I've given you today that says we've now caught up on ticket sales versus last year through a super strong April sales. We will deliver a fairly strong year in an economy where most people aren't delivering growth at all.
Alan Gould – Natixis: Can you just refresh my memory, the ticketing cost you, was it $15 million on ticketing last year?
Elizabeth Willard: A little bit less than that. We ended the year about $13 million in comps.
Alan Gould – Natixis: And opposed to January a similar amount of profit this year?
Elizabeth Willard: That was based on the presentation we did when we were first rolling our ticketing. It's still in that range, somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million dollar range.
Michael Rapino: I would say just so we're clear, it will be a spectacular feat because we will grow into the positive so we'll grow a $15 million swing from negative to positive. The only two pieces that will slightly affect our dream of getting to $15 million in the first year is you've heard a lot of noise about the secondary business.  We had planned in there to have a more aggressive secondary strategy this year that we're now kind of put on the back burner as we understand that market better, so that took a few million off our plan, and we also had a few million in our sponsorship that as we said earlier could come to some risk. So we think we'll deliver the core driver of that division, the service fees times ticket equals profit. We'll be off plan on secondary revenue and sponsorship revenue within that $15 million which will be the only two pressure points against delivering that exact number.
Alan Gould – Natixis: With regard to the Ticketmaster deal and the timing of it, isn't it closing by the end of this year a little bit aggressive and what are the milestones we should look for from this point forward?
Michael Rapino: We're into second review as we've announced which is just an extensive data collection period. So all indications we're getting from our advisors is that fall is a very reasonable close and time period. In terms of our business right now, we're pretty much focused on executing the core, the milestones; we're into Ticketmaster's into some, refinancing our bank debt.  That's going well. We assume that will get done soon, and I guess we'll have a shareholder vote late July, maybe early August would be the next milestone. And then after that you would just look for the close.
Alan Gould – Natixis: So we should expect a proxy early June?
Elizabeth Willard: By late May, early June is where we're timing right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph.
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph: I just want to go back to deferred revenue. I'm a little confused because you had said that ticket sales were kind of in line with last year, but with the deferred revenue up so much, I'm a little confused by that. Are you just selling the tickets a little earlier this year or are you just understating that you're going to have a strong summer.
Michael Rapino: A bit of both. I've kind of given you guidance which I don't typically do on where we think we'll end up on attendance by the end of the year. So you can look at our historic 52 million tickets last year or all in and figure out where we'll be. We built a plan this year that said the economic crisis has to affect you somewhere. We know though that we had a super strong slate because of the stadiums and Madonna and U2 and our festival business is on fire in Europe which is a really early on sale. So we knew International was going to have a strong year, so we knew we could look for growth from international. We knew North America we had a super year last year in our amphitheaters and we didn't want to chase that exact market share in some of those shows and get ourselves into any risky shows to try to match that exact number. So in overall, you're right. The numbers should suggest we've beaten the last year. We're looking at it as we were down in Q1. If you add in our strong April sales and our deferred revenue and you kind of trend it out for the year, we will be very happy at the end of the year if we're up internationally, down slightly in North America and overall pacing flat to a few points down, since we know how to make more money from an attendee year over year. So we're just looking at the strong on sales. There's a little bit of head room. In this business it's all about there's not bad bands, there's just bad deals. So when you have a strong solid plan, you don't have to then chase a lot of extra which sometimes can get you in trouble. So we're going to take all that on sale, all that extra win we have right now and we're going to just execute against that and extract what we can from that piece of the pie versus going for 5% extra sales which could work or could not work in this economy.
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph: On the international side you took a big hit on currency. Can you comment where that was, because the Euro didn't fall much against the dollar, though the pound did and obviously some of the South American currencies got hit pretty hard too? '
Elizabeth Willard: The biggest currency impacts for us were the pound and then the Swedish Kroner. We had a little bit of Euro impact, but you're right. The biggest pieces came from that.
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph: And do you see the international mix still remaining in those countries as you go into the summer? 
Elizabeth Willard: Yes. Our biggest countries are those plus Belgium and Holland so that's where you're going to see most of our activity.
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph: As far as the disclosure on the Artist Nation, do you plan on doing some type of metrics and judge how the Artist Nation's doing in the future?
Michael Rapino: Absolutely we will. Probably towards the end of the year, Q3 or Q4 probably. I think once we have the entire Madonna tour cycle wrapped up, the U2 won't be wrapped by then but it will be in full motion. JZ will be in; hopefully Shakira will be staring to go out. So I think by the end of the year we'll be able to talk about how those bands did not only from a touring but a sponsorship, accessory sales and all of the pieces of how they all added up against our investment. So we'll definitely, although not segment them out because we want them to be considered just part of our continued core touring strategy, but we will definitely provide investors that update.
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph: I'm sure you've heard cable vision talked about closing the garden for some parts of the year for the next four years and that's certain sections. I know New York is an important market for North American business. Can you talk about what impact that could have?
Michael Rapino: MSG is the greatest venue in the world. Every band wants to play it. We love working with those guys, but like every other city there is always a venue down the street. So we have the Jones Beach which we focus on in our summer and as you know living in New York, there's a whole bunch of excess arenas now looking for dates every day of the week. So at the end of the day, a bank likes to play MSG but if it's not open and they have to play Jersey, they're fine with that.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management] 
[Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management]: I have some questions about the status of Live Nations ticketing efforts on the year and this part of what new business you're soliciting as part of the upcoming merger. As I understand it you're basically just doing ticketing for your own venues but not soliciting other outside venues, is that correct?
Michael Rapino: Yes.
[Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management]: Is that under the planned business model going forward even after the merger?
Michael Rapino: No. We've been talking well before we announced this merger that the most important thing to do in 2009 was to execute against our inventory. We are the scale of our inventory is a big challenge. So we didn't have the capability and the resources to be chasing other people's businesses this year so our plan always was in 2009, let's make sure we can do the best job executing our inventory and by the end of the year as we can prove out to others that we know how to do it, our model works. This website works. Our platform works. Then we would look at third party business at that point.
[Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management]: And is that still the plan after the merger, to still have that happen?
Michael Rapino: Yes.
[Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management]: Is there any sort of official contracted agreement with Ticketmaster to not do that or is that simply your own business strategy.
Michael Rapino: That was our business strategy well before the merger announcement. Merger or not we wouldn't be chasing new buildings this month. We've got a big summer season and selling our tickets and our amphitheater and maximizing every ticket sale we can is our number execution strategy right now.
[Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management]: So basically you're just going to show hey everyone look how we did it our own way in 2009 and 2010 you're going to go elsewhere to sell your opportunities. How is that going to work going forward when you're going to be competing basically one side of the house versus the other side of the house in 2010?
Michael Rapino: I'm going to leave all that merger stuff for another call because it's premature at this point on how the two will work together on a public basis. But we'll leave those for another call when we can get into that.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to management.
Michael Rapino: Thank you everybody.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Rapino, Chief Executive Officer.
Michael Rapino : Welcome to our 2008 fourth quarter and yearend conference call. I am joined by my CFO Kathy Willard. Our operating and financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2008 capped an outstanding year for Live Nation. We successfully executed on our strategic plan and generated improved results across the majority of the metrics used to evaluate our operating and financial progress. Highlights of the fourth quarter include our total fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $28.4 million which was ahead of expectations. For the full year period we delivered 20% growth and adjusted operating income. We believe this performance is well ahead of all of our peers. We grew the number of shows we produce by 33% in the fourth quarter and increased total attendance by over 14% during the same period. We also increased total sponsorship revenue by nearly 14% during the quarter while average revenue per sponsor increased by nearly 15% for the year. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge our North American Music operating income nearly tripled to $43 million for the full year.  Overall, we believe these results are outstanding given the severe global economic downturn. Millions of fans have continued to attend live concerts to support their favorite artist despite the challenging times. This trend has continued in to the current quarter as ticket sales are pacing in line with last year. Artists continue to rely on touring as a primary driver of their income and we believe our pipe will match the levels we achieved in 2008. As a sampling of the super stars touring in 2009 include Cold Play, Jonas Brothers, Madonna, Nickelback and ACDC, just to name a few of the many artists who will perform in 2009. Live Nation’s mission is to maximize revenue generated by the live concert experience. Our business model is driven by monetizing our global distribution pipe.  Let me briefly update you on the execution in 2008. Growing our core business model has two labors: filling our pipe; and monetizing the pipe. On our first strategic imperative of filling our pipe we continued to fill our distribution pipe by buying artist rights more effectively and at the right price securing both near and long term revenue streams while minimizing our risk. We promoted almost 7,000 events with over 13 million attendees during the fourth quarter compared to 5,200 events with nearly 12 million attendees a year ago, an increase of approximately 14% in attendance and 33% in events. For the full year we promoted over 22,000 events with over 52 million attendees compared to 17,000 events and 46 million attendees in 2007 an increase of 12% in attendance and 32% in events. We continue to add ancillary rights in order to provide our artists a broader array of services and expand our exposure to higher margin revenue streams. We have secured approximately 850 ancillary rights in 2008. Madonna’s tour concluded on December 21st and was hugely successful exceeding our forecast model. Upon its conclusion the tour became the number one largest grossing tour in history by a solo artist and with 58 shows in Europe, North America and South America generated over $280 million in ticket sales. In January, Madonna announced that she’s extending her tour and going back on the road beginning July 4th in London. This is the first time that Madonna has ever extended her tour which speaks to the remarkable demand worldwide. Madonna will be visiting 22 markets overall in 2009 leg of which is already sold out.  Monetizing the pipe; so there’s no doubt we succeeded in filing the pipe in 2008 and we expect to do the same in 2009. Here’s an update on how we grew and monetized the pipe. Our first strategy is always to expand the pipe. In 2008 we extended our geographic footprint by entering Latin America through an exclusive distribution deal with CIE. We entered the market of Dubai through the acquisition of Mirage. In addition we expanded our venue platform by acquiring the Heineken musical in Amsterdam, opened our new House of Blues in Houston and finishing our expansion of the highly successful Point in Dublin which is now reopened. In February of this year the House of Blues in Boston opened. Our second strategy is to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Adjusted operating income in our North American Music segment increased $46 million for the full year as we increased the average profit by show by 25% partially driven by improved cost controls around talent buying and venue operating costs. Our third strategy is to increase our in venue revenues. For the full year total revenue per attendee increased to $78.34 from $78.14 in the prior year. Total revenue per attendee in the fourth quarter was $66.49 versus $76.54 in the prior quarter, a decrease of 13% as a result of less arena shows in international and a currency exchange rate exchange. For North American Music we generated revenue per fan of $73.28 in 2008 up nearly 4% compared to revenue of $70.67 in 2004. Our focus here remains the same increasing ancillary sales per fan in the food and beverage category while promoting operating efficiencies. In 2008 we entered in to a new concession contract with SMG-SAVOR and ARAMARK for managing the food and beverage concessions at 34 of our North American amphitheaters. We expect this new partnership to generate roughly 20% increase in adjusted operating income for North American concession business in 2009.  Our fourth strategy is to expand sponsorship. We continue to attract larger and more profitable advertising and marketing campaigns. During the fourth quarter our sponsorship revenue recognized increased nearly 14%. For the full year sponsorship revenue recognized increased over 4% and our average revenue per sponsor increased nearly 15%. To date in 2009 sponsorship revenue are pacing ahead of the same in 2008 by over 25%. However, we do believe sponsorship is the biggest challenge in 2009 as a broader advertising downturn will impact the overall sponsorship dollar. Our final strategy is expansion in to our ticketing and ecommerce platform. Our ticketing platform is proceeding according to plan. We launched in late December and while we had some learning curves especially when volume is enormous, our platform is working well and we’re making the right adjustments to strengthen our ability to handle shows that generate unexpected traffic. We also recently relaunched LiveNation.com store front in order to better differentiate our offering in the marketplace and deliver improved functionality and transparency to consumers. We are seeing steady increases in traffic flow to our website and have sold over $1 million tickets to over 1,300 shows since our launch in December. In summary, three years ago we set out on a clear three year transformation plan. We embarked on a mission to transfer what was then a declining fragmented live entertainment company in to a global artist to fan concert company. We have a three core strategies to achieve this number one was shedding non-core assets which we are 90% completed. Two, was turning around our declining North American core business. Since we took over we have grown the global North American business by over 50% and our third strategy was vertically integrating our operations with our ticketing and ecommerce business to strengthen the artist to fan connection and achieve more efficient marketing, develop better products and drive higher margins. We have largely completed the transformation of our operations so some so some of you may ask whey then did we decide to merge? The answer is the merger is consistent with the strategy we laid out three years ago, that is to maximize our concert pipe and vertically expand in to a complimentary businesses that strengthen the artist to fan connection and improve our growth profile.  We chose CPS to help build our ticketing capability however, the option to now merge with Ticketmaster allows us to advance our strategy and start providing the ecommerce marketing products and solutions of the future today. Let’s be clear, we can get to the end game either way, we just believe these economic times require faster transformation to meet the evolving needs of the artist and fans today.  So, on February 10th we announced that we had entered in to a merger agreement with Ticketmaster Entertainment. Once closed the combined entity which will be called Live Nation Entertainment will accelerate the execution of our vision and strategy to build an artist driven company that provides a full service connection between artist and fans. Both companies have proven leadership in their respective businesses but it’s clear neither are moving fast enough or have the complete model to address the artist and fan needs in these fast changing times. Together, we believe we can harness more technology an great jobs in the development of a world class technology ecommerce platform, relieve pressures on price in both primary and secondary by generating new revenue streams for the artist, increase sponsorship dollars, invest in new artists and provide a marketing channel to help them find a fan base, provide more secure and robust platform for fans to buy tickets, deliver more shows to venues as new stars grow, attract higher attendance for artist through better dynamic pricing and promotion. In addition, through this combination we believe we can create a more diversified company with a stronger financial profile that will be in a better position to drive improved shareholder value over time. Specifically, the merger creates a diversified business across a portfolio of live entertainment genres and across the live entertainment value chain. It brings together Live Nation’s attractive growth profile with Ticketmaster’s strong cash profile. I provides opportunity for significant operating synergies of approximately $40 million to the combination of ticketing, marketing, data centers and back room and lastly improves our credit profile on a relative basis versus the Live Nation standalone. We believe these strategic and financial benefits will help us to speed the fruition of our business and deliver significant value to our shareholders in the future. So, to conclude, 2008 was a solid year for the live concert industry and a superior year for live concert industry and superior for Live Nation. We grew our core business despite a very economic backdrop and more importantly would deliver what we told investors we would deliver in 2008 as well as over the last three years. The merger aside we are focused on executing and delivering another solid year through our focus on three priorities: ensuring our pipe is full at the right price; implementing all measures to maximize revenue and further improve cost structures across the pipe; and continuing to grow our online ecommerce business via our Live Nation ticketing inventory. Our management team will be working hard to close the merger and when completed we believe we’ll be able to quickly consolidate these complimentary businesses and execute against a clear strategic road map. Looking ahead our concert pipe remains robust as evidenced by the strong group of artists that have already committed to touring. Ticket sales continue to pace in line with sales at this point last year. Again, given the state of the economy and the pressures on the consumer we are very pleased with these trends.  We are optimistic about 2009 given the strength we are seeing across our business, our intense focus on execution and the fact that million so fans continue to attend live shows despite very tough times. Now, I’ll turn it over to Kathy who will comment on our financial outlook.
Kathy Willard : During the fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $916 million which was down $6.4 million compared to revenues of $922.4 million in the same period last year. The slight revenue decline was primarily due to a decrease in International Music resulting from a disposition of a portion of our promotion business in Italy and reduced promotion activity primarily related to arena events in several European markets.  This decline was offset by a strong increase in Artist Nation revenues drive by Madonna’s sticky and sweet tour as well as the benefits from several of our recent acquisitions in International Music and the Artist Nation segments. For the fourth quarter of 2008 we experienced normal quarterly fluctuations in our adjusted operating income with a reported adjusted operating income of $28.4 million, a slight decrease of $5.5 million as compared to $33.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year. These decrease in adjusted operating income was driven primarily by increased costs as expected in our ticketing segment resulting from the build out of our ticketing platform and a decrease in show results in several European markets in the International Music segment. These declines were offset by the impact of Madonna’s tour in Artist Nation as well as the benefits of acquisitions in both International Music and Artist Nation. As you note, we experienced a net loss and an operating loss during the quarter and this was driven by a goodwill impairment charge of $269.9 million that we recorded in the quarter. This impairment was recorded based on the company’s annual impairment test and was required according to FCC guidance and accounting literature due to the company’s market cap at year-end and the fair value of our total assets which are much greater than the goodwill recorded. As a result, our operating loss in the fourth quarter was $317.1 million compared to an operating loss of $24 million in the fourth quarter 2007. Excluding this goodwill impairment charge the operating loss for the fourth quarter was $47.2 million. This year-over-year decline of $23.2 was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expenses and non-cash compensation along with a slight overall decline in adjusted operating income previously discussed. Overall, our net loss including the goodwill impairment charge was $337.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to a net loss of $18.4 million for the same period last year.  Moving on to yearend results, for the full year consolidated revenue increased to $4.2 billion an 11% increase over 2007. This increase was driven primarily North American Music due to increases in the number of events, total ancillary revenue per attendee and increased attendance. 2008 had a strong artist lineup for North America music including the Dave Mathews Band, Journey, Jimmy Buffet and the Jonas Brothers. We also had the benefit of recent acquisitions in North American Music, Artist Nation and International Music.  Our adjusted operating income was $169.8 million for the full year an improvement of nearly $29 million compared to $141.1 million in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by strong growth in North American Music based on the revenue growth noted and also due to cost controls and show related expenses. Adjusted operated income for 2008 also benefited from a recent acquisition.  These increases were partially offset by a decline in Artist Nation based on the overall volume and size of tours this year as compared to 2007 and higher infrastructure costs and also impacted by increased costs and ticketing for the build out of our ticketing platform. Our operating loss for the full year including the goodwill impairment charge was $284.2 million compared to operating income of $16.8 million in the prior year.  Excluding the goodwill impairment charge of $269.9 million, our operating loss for 2008 was $14.3 million despite the growth in adjusted operating income. This was driven by increased depreciation amortization expense and a decrease gain related to the sale of several assets in 2007. Overall, our net loss for 2008 including the goodwill impairment charge was $231.8 million as compared to a net loss of $11.9 million in 2007. Turning now to other key financial information; as of December 31st, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $199.7 million. Of this, our free cash which is essentially cash less event related items was $32.2 million. Free cash flow was up in the fourth quarter of 2008 to $11.2 million compared to negative free cash flow of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of ’07. Capital expenditures for the 12 months were $186.9 million which includes $25 million of maintenance expenditures which is a decrease over 2007 and $161.9 million of revenue generating projects. As we have discussed previously these revenue generating projects are primarily for the development and renovation of various venues during the year including the O2 Dublin arena in Ireland formerly known as The Point and the two new House of Blues in Houston and Boston in addition to our ticketing roll out. Overall, 2008 was the most capital intensive year in our history as a public company and we expect our capital expenditures to decrease significantly in 2009.  As of December 31, 2008 our total long term debt including our outstanding redeemable preferred stock was $925.7 million. We have no significant debt maturities under our primary debt instruments until June 2012 and the company continues to remain comfortably in compliance with all of our debt covenants are yearend. Based on the investments we have made over the last three years we continue to believe we will deliver solid adjusted operating income growth in 2009 and beyond as we continue to grow our core operations and realize the impact of these investments in venues, artists and our ticketing operations. With that, I will open up the call for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David C. Joyce – Miller Tabak & Co., LLC.
David C. Joyce – Miller Tabak & Co., LLC: There are some good metrics coming out of this quarter and I was wondering if you could fill in if there’s like some sort of seasonality going here? Overall the attendance was below what we expected but better revenue per attendee, is that I guess ancillary revenue that flows through from the events possibly that’s on an uptrend?
Michael Rapino : Yes, absolutely. 
David C. Joyce – Miller Tabak & Co., LLC: Because that metric was up but I was wondering also because of the global economic slowdown how much of that was a factor to some of the European countries you mentioned versus it being pipeline volume?
Michael Rapino : Zero. In the fourth quarter it was arena show comparable 2008 to 2007 in Europe was down so if you don’t have the big arena shows – remember, we don’t have amphitheaters in Europe so if our arena shows are down our ancillaries go down. Then also a large majority of it was just pure currency year-over-year. I’d just tell you that although it’s not a big month and as most of you know Q1 is a fairly irrelevant quarter in our overall year since we’re actually just buying the shows and getting them on sale for the summer.  Now, that we’ve sold motorsports year-over-year it will be a very low quota for us in terms of activity. But, we do have some shows that have been already executed, Nickelback is already on sale and closing nightly sold out and our per heads or any of the revenue metrics in January and February seem online with last year so we have not seen any decline in ticket sales or decline in someone having a beer, or a hot dog or parking at the venue in these arenas that they’re going to already.
David C. Joyce – Miller Tabak & Co., LLC: On the sponsorship front, granted you said that in this advertising environment that’s going to be one of the challenges for this year and you were still up 14% in the fourth quarter is there any clear seasonality starting to emerge from sponsorship revenue or is it very highly linked with the regular concert season?
Michael Rapino : It’s 100% linked with the concern season. Usually, a sponsor would be buying some activity whether it’s a sign, a sampling or some advertising campaign that’s usually probably going to happen with the majority of the shows are so we haven’t seen any decline to date. But, we are absolutely in the middle of renewing for the summer and we would say that in Q3 we knocked it out of the park and there was a lot of skepticism on was that history and with the future on ticket sales hurt us?  We’ve now shown you in Q4 we didn’t get hit by ticket sales and as of the first two months we haven’t gotten hit by ticket sales. So, we can confidently say, although no one has believed us for months that we are fairly recession proof in the concert business in terms of that consumer going to those two shows a year and having a hot dog or beer. So, we do not believe in 2009 that we will have a pipe problem in terms of the number of shows, number of people walking in or them spending their $12 to $15 on parking and food.  But, we absolutely believe that if we’re reading the tea leaves on everyone else who’s being affected by the advertising downturn that we could have some pressure closing some of our sponsorship deals going in to the next couple of months. Now, the good news is most of my sponsorship business is on a one to three year cycle so we don’t have a huge amount of deals up in any one year. We have about 25% of our deals up for renewals in terms of risk in the final closing in the next two months internationally here if some of those deals don’t get closed.  In that sponsor ship business as you can imagine you could have a deal approved on a Friday and it could be in trouble by a Tuesday. So, that business we’re just tracking daily and if we think anywhere we get hit this year that could be an area that could be anywhere from a $5 to $15 million risk on our business. 
David C. Joyce – Miller Tabak & Co., LLC: Has any of that started to emerge because in the fourth quarter you did have greater sponsorship revenue but fewer sponsors. Is there some sort of shift in to larger sponsors maybe in better fiscal shape?
Michael Rapino : Well we purposely drove that and you’ll notice hopefully if we’ll successful, over a three year period you’ll see our sponsorship number go down in terms of the number of sponsors but the revenue per sponsor go up. We actually over the last two years have been cutting sponsors at the bottom level. If you were a $5 to $15 sponsor we started to cut those sponsors and require a minimum commitment because the servicing of those sponsors is expensive.  So, we’ve been very successful in reducing the execution but increasing our bigger deals. So, that’s the result of the success you’ve seen in Q4. As of right now we seem on track, we don’t have any data right now that would suggest that the sponsorship category could not deliver its plan but I do want to look at the fuller market impacts on advertising. If there was risk which a lot of people thought for the last few months would be, “Will they come to the show?” “Will they buy a beer?” That doesn’t seem to be the risk which is the good part, that’s the solid foundation to what will drive the machine for us this year but we do expect that we will have some sponsorship challenges on the overall business and we’re planning and have a [inaudible] in place for that if that is to come to life.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Mark D. Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, LLC.
Mark D. Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, LLC: Just a follow up to that last question, what percentage roughly of your expected business has been booked this year or typically is booked by this time this year both in attendance for the shows and in sponsorships? Are you typically 15% of the year booked by now?
Michael Rapino : I’ll give you two of them. Do you have that number?
Kathy Willard : Sponsorship we’re running same point in time compared to last year 25% over where we were last year Mark.
Mark D. Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, LLC: But what percentage of the business is booked of your expected full year business?
Michael Rapino : Right now it would be – we call it three levels of booked we’ve got contracted, we’ve got letter of intent so right now we have 63% booked 2009. A year ago to date we would have only had 56% booked so we are running ahead of where we historically are in terms of booked sponsorship business so that’s good. On the music side we would be running exactly flat right now year-over-year. We are identical in terms of the number of shows on sale, the number we’ve got over 5 million tickets sold on the comparison basis and historically right now you would have not on sale but you would have booked in the pipeline hopefully by March because you’re going to be on sale in two months, you have at least 50% of your summer booked and we are tracking on that right now.
Mark D. Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, LLC: Can you just confirm that the company still expects the ticketing business, your own internal ticketing that the cash flow will largely reverse to the mid teens millions adjusted loss from ’08 in ’09?
Michael Rapino : Right. You mean the fixed cost investment turns in to a positive in 2009, yes.
Mark D. Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, LLC: Kathy, any interest in putting a range around the significant cap ex decline in ’09? Could that number be $100 million or below?
Kathy Willard : It will be – we’re still finalizing the numbers but we expect it to be less than $50 million for the year in total.
Mark D. Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, LLC: Then last question, how much of the reported cash, not the free cash balance but the reported cash balance of the bank count against the company and the leverage ratio?
Kathy Willard : As we’ve disclosed in our covenants we can deduct up to $150 million in total cash.
Mark D. Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, LLC: Whether the cash is free cash for not?
Kathy Willard : That’s correct.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC.
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: Following up first on Mark’s question about sponsorship, the 63% number you were talking about, that’s booked. Is that sort of everything from deals that were signed to letter of intents out there or is that actual deals that have been signed?
Michael Rapino : That would be considered contracted and gone to letter of intent. So, those would be committed in our world. We then have two other categories where we would call them in negotiations and then we would have TBDs. 
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: Generally speaking are most letters of intents you get out there most of them I suppose are closed eventually?
Michael Rapino : Yes, 100%. 
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: Starting at the beginning, from an fx perspective, if in terms of guarantees, obviously there will always be an artist who is only playing in the US or only playing in Europe you can obviously pay them guarantees only in Euros or dollars. When you get artist like Madonna that are playing in both parts of the pond if you will, are you giving them just a global guarantee in US dollars or are you giving them an Euro guarantee for the European dates and the same thing for US dollar dates.
Kathy Willard : Ben, it varies with artist but certainly when there’s a difference in currency between how we’re paying the artist and what currency we’re selling the tickets in we look if hedging is appropriate.
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: And have you done so?
Kathy Willard : Sure.
Michael Rapino : Absolutely. But, just to give you perspective, 99% of our shows are booked locally. So, our Swedish operation is booking every day in that currency so on an exception like Madonna and U2s are we doing a global deal and we would hedge all the time. 
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: In terms of the debt levels it looks like you were up about $80 million or so on the revolver for the quarter can you sort of walk us through from a debt perspective do we see debt like is that sort of a typical fourth quarter draw down and then the first half it gets paid down? I just want to get a sense of the seasonality of some of the revolver and how we should be looking at it.
Kathy Willard : That’s basically right Ben. Obviously, as fourth quarter and first quarter being quieter quarters for us and we’re funding artist advances and you’re going to see more draws on the revolver. However, when we start to put tickets on sale then that will start turning around.
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: So, if we were to look at sort of the average debt level for the year, let’s say the average debt level in ’09 as you sort of see the world, do you anticipate the average debt level to be below that of ’08 on the average?
Kathy Willard : Ben, I don’t have those numbers with me. Certainly, we’re focused on growing the operations this year and putting less reliance on the revolver and there are other things like we talked about including the potential sale of UK Theatre and other assets that can impact that as well. So, it’s a little hard for me to predict that.
Michael Rapino : But, it is safe to say – you can tell by the number we’re just giving you on cap ex that we have brought down our cap ex considerably. We will still operate our buildings to the levels we need but in 2009 we will not be using any capital for anything else than basic cap ex. We do look between the Boston Opera House, the New York 42nd Street Theaters and the UK Theatres we will be shopping those this year in an effort to remove our final non-core assets and put that money in the bank. We will grow our operations this year through our return on our investments from the House of Blues and Point with the overall objective to reduce debt and get in to free cash flow by 2010 and all those measures to get there.
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: I think sort of last question for me, in terms of CTS Eventim, where do they – let’s say for the sake of the conversation that the Ticketmaster deal is successful, you pass all the requirements you need to pass regulatory wise, where does CTS Eventim fall? Do they stay with you until their contract is over, do you buy them out? I want to get a sense if there’s an early penalty or something of that nature?
Michael Rapino : No, there’s no early penalty and as of right now we met with Klaus Schulenburg last week. We are very committed to honoring our contract. If you think about the CTS deal it is a great software platform that we license in North America and we will continue to do that. But, really where the fruit of the relationship is both for Klaus Schulenburg and ourselves is really international where we are in markets with him as he expands.  So, we envision the merger getting approved and we do envision life continuing with CTS and the new merged company under its existing contract and any other way that we can kind of operate on a global basis that makes sense for both of us.
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: Then just sort of the last one before I cede the floor. We’ve seen [inaudible] say that they’ve got the right to exit Ticketmaster in case you guys merge. What’s your thoughts in sort of reaching out to some of these other promoters who possibly have these kinds of deals? Do you think you can keep everyone in the fold if you will?
Michael Rapino : Well listen, we won’t comment on the AG Ticketmaster part since that’s still really their business. We would have went through obviously when we decided to merge we would have built a very dynamic model that said, “What will this company look like going forward?” Be clear, we said it last week in Washington, market share wasn’t the priority, growing it was definitely not the priority and losing some market share is absolutely okay with us in the overall picture because we believe the real benefit of the combined new entity is to start developing new products based around the artist, the website and the fan. We’re not worried about what business we lose. We’ve modeled that out, we think it can be a much more stable profitable business with less market share but better products in the long run.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Tuna Amobi – Standard and Poor’s.
Tuna Amobi – Standard and Poor’s: With regard to the margin, I’m just trying to get a little bit more quantitative commentary perhaps from Michael on what kind of vibes we’re hearing in Washington. It just seems like since the time you guys announced this transaction there has been a lot of I don’t know if outcry is the world as well as from some of the major artists out there surprisingly. So, just trying to wonder, get a sense from you how you feel in terms of the relative chances of this deal going through? Would you say that since last week your expectations have improved based on the public responses or gotten a little dimmer or how do you feel overall qualitatively?
Michael Rapino : We’re very confident. I mean, nothing happened in the last three weeks that we wouldn’t have predicted was going to happen in terms of the press. We realized that one of the core issues is Ticketmaster is not going to win a lot of popular vote right now. It has always kind of been at the front end of taking most of the industry brunt when a consumer can’t get a great ticket. So, we understand clearly the issues with the Ticketmaster brand.  We believe the foundation at the Ticketmaster their core business is strong and one, that’s why we called it Live Nation Entertainment. We believe we can turn that combined business in to a much more fan artist friendly business. Number two, just to kind of put it on the table, we have not had a large number of artists against this deal at all. There was Bruce Springsteen who had a very big issue with the way some of his tickets were sold on Ticketmaster but we delivered artist support letters last week to Washington. We have seen a real strong support from the artists who are definitely looking for a continued strong business partner in the live music business to help them through these tough times while maybe their record label business partner hasn’t been delivering for them. We absolutely expect to get this approved. We expect it to be a very thorough review by the DOJ. We have great respect for them they’ll do their job.  We believe on a horizontal level we’ll prove both management promoting and ticketing there are great competitors and on the vertical we will prove that there’s no leverage that is going to be used or has been gained by this combination that puts anything of competition at risk. We do believe building a better mousetrap is okay and we will prove that the better mousetrap is what the consumer needs today but surely will have a ton of competition going forward.
Tuna Amobi – Standard and Poor’s: Would you characterize given the atmosphere in Washington right now with the new administration perhaps the timing of that is would you say perhaps suspicious?
Michael Rapino : That’s not my job. We put a lot of work in to building my company, we believe this is a great move for the Live Nation shareholder and our business model. It’s completely consistent with everything we’re going to do and we have great respect for the DOJ process which is a very legal and factual based review. We’ll leave it to the pros and our board and our management team spend a lot of time reviewing all of the options and believe we will get approved in the end and it was the right move in the interim. We’ll let all the other stuff [inaudible].
Tuna Amobi – Standard and Poor’s: A real quick follow up on a comment you made on the merger call. I think I was kind of struck when you said that you were kind of looking to use Ticketmaster as kind of your front door with or without the deal? If I’m correct in that interpretation. Then, I’m just looking at some of the other sources out there, the outlets, whether it’s the artist’s website or MusicToday, of course your own ticketing platform, how do you see all these various sources coming together as you think about your own platform which I was under the impression that you were looking to actually drive most of the sales from there. Particularly from your own venues there seems like there’s going to be a mix and match of some of these different channels including Ticketmaster.
Michael Rapino : I’m not sure what you’re reading but that’s nowhere near where we are. We’ve never stated that we’re going to use Ticketmaster’s front door. We use LiveNation.com as our front door for all of our controlled tickets at our venues. We have been doing that since January and have been building that front door for a couple of years. What I did say is people are sometimes confused that we also have 50% of the shows that we do promote are in Ticketmaster buildings which are sold at Ticketmaster because we don’t control those tickets.
Tuna Amobi – Standard and Poor’s: Are you looking to reduce that 50% perhaps given your ticketing launch? I mean assuming the merger does not occur are you still going to not want to do anything about that 50% or are you just going to live with that?
Michael Rapino : Our business is based on we put artist in venues and make the ancillary revenues and dollars from it. A lot of times it makes sense to put our artist like Madonna’s or Coldplay that we’re promoting in to Ticketmaster buildings whether it’s the Staples’ Center or Madison Square Garden. If that’s the right building for the artist that’s where we’ll put them. If the ticketing function happens to be through Ticketmaster than that’s what we’ll do. Our business model provides us to put the artist in the right venue where we can maximize revenue and where the artist is approving to play. Many times it’s our own buildings, many times it’s in great arenas around the world and we have great ancillary revenue lines whether they’re in our buildings or others and that’s the way we drive our business.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Alan S. Gould – Nataxis Bleichroeder, Inc.
Alan S. Gould – Nataxis Bleichroeder, Inc.: I’ve got a few questions, first Michael can you tell us what milestones we should be looking for in terms of this merger process? Is there filings, any dates when the DOJ is suppose to come back to ask more questions or make any rulings?
Michael Rapino : We don’t really have any out loud. Michael Rowles, my GC I guess we’ve got our 30 days we’ll be coming back now that we filed with the DOJ and would expect to hear from them after the 30 days and that will be the first milestone. We’ll have a shareholder vote after that in the next few months. I think we’re business as usual, we’ve already begun the process of filing and after 30 days we should have more sight.
Alan S. Gould – Nataxis Bleichroeder, Inc.: When will the merger document be filed?
Michael Rapino : What do you think Kathy?
Kathy Willard : Within the next 45 days.
Alan S. Gould – Nataxis Bleichroeder, Inc.: Switching to the ticketing, one question, I know that CTS event that they had done the World Cup so they had some experience with some big events, obviously it’s a learning curve that you’re starting, you’re using their system now but can you just go through a little bit of what happened in the first quarter, what hiccups there are and why you’re confident that things will be fine when we start selling for the big summer shows?
Michael Rapino : Sure. Listen, we’ve been selling since January so we’ve sold well over as I said the million tickets so we have no issue that the system sells tickets, works when you go to our site. The only weekend where we absolutely dropped the ball was when we put the FISH on sales on and God bless FISH, a huge band. We had 1 million hits at our 10 am website. That’s an incredible big load for us and it was nothing really to do with the ticketing platform or the store front it was just a combination the two weren’t talking well together on letting 1 million people come through the front door. So the engineers from both sides worked hard over the weekend to readjusted for that and since then we’ve had Coldplay on sales and every weekend on sales. We’re more than confident that we will absolutely and now can handle the load and we haven’t had a breakdown of that nature since. We remind people that Ticketmasters’ system blew up on Bruce Springsteen. These ticketing systems do crash when there are huge, huge drivers to the site.  One of the challenges and we said it last week in Washington, one of the challenges is the secondary scalping market is very sophisticated and they have these incredible electronic platforms that blow in to your system at that 10 am on sale to grab as many seats as possible and they’re a whole new level of business that you have work against. Anyways, we had a meltdown on the Fish 10 am. We still sold out the shows by the end of the day and we haven’t had a melt down since. We’re now confident these platforms can handle the load. I’m not telling you that over the summer we won’t have a couple of technical issues and a glitch here and there but 100% the drive train works on our ticketing platform and we’re already off to the races and huge numbers.
Alan S. Gould – Nataxis Bleichroeder, Inc.: So it was basically one incident that got all this press?
Michael Rapino : Absolutely.
Alan S. Gould – Nataxis Bleichroeder, Inc.: Kathy, two financial questions. Can you tell us what the fx impact was in the fourth quarter and if fx stays where it is today what it would be for ’09? Can you also tell us on this $270 million impairment charge, what assets where written down? Was it all goodwill, was there any real estate, was there any other assets written down as part of that $270?
Kathy Willard : The goodwill impairment charge just requires you to look at your goodwill compared to your overall fair value of assets so no, it did not require any write down on the other assets and actually just implies that we have more fair value of unrecorded assets around things like the Live Nation trade name that aren’t part of our balance sheet. It was just related to goodwill and it was specifically in the North American Music and Artist Nation segments. So, nothing outside of that Alan.
Alan S. Gould – Nataxis Bleichroeder, Inc.: And the fx?
Kathy Willard : The fx, I do not have the ’09 numbers for you but the overall impact just on revenue alone for the full year was around $8 million.
Alan S. Gould – Nataxis Bleichroeder, Inc.: So that would have been all fourth quarter I’m assuming?
Kathy Willard : That’s a full year number. I don’t have the fourth quarter standalone with me.
Operator:  Your next question comes from David B. Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc.
David B. Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc.: First question, can you just talk about the total revenue per attendee for the fourth quarter, it feel by about $7? And, is that all ticketing because I know you said beer and the food remained constant? Then, what would be the trend there going forward?
Michael Rapino : You were asking Q4?
David B. Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc.: Your total revenue per attendee dropped $7.
Kathy Willard : That’s really related to the international mix that Michael highlighted in this script.
David B. Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc.: So the Italy, that whole issue?
Kathy Willard : Just the arena shows timing.
David B. Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc.: Now, will that move back up in the first quarter and throughout next year or are we at that level going forward?
Michael Rapino : That’s international and we would assume depending on currency but we would assume that should work its way back up over the summer as the arena shows increase.
Kathy Willard : We’re always going to have some quarterly fluctuations obviously but that was really just timing of the shows and the fx. But, we’d expect that over the summer season that’s more impactful.
Michael Rapino : David, that’s why we always say the real metric to us is the year because, if you have a bunch of tours in one quarter versus the other it could be relevant or not. We like to just look at the entire year so you get the full up and downs of touring to say did the business per revenue increase, decrease, etc.? On a year basis we’re very proud of the overall numbers on all those metrics.
David B. Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc.: Now, you said at one point ’08 was a strong year, can you comment on ’09 or is it still too early?
Michael Rapino : No, I mean listen we believe – again, we do know from what we understand on the overall live business sports, theater, motorsports, Broadway versus concerts, from everything we’ve heard we in the concert business we are absolutely delivering strong numbers and consistent numbers year-over-year. I think if you’re in the other businesses you’re probably going to feel a little bit of tough 2009 and quite honestly that’s a very simple analogy. If you look at a sports team, they’ve got 90 games to sell whereas in our economic we have one Aerosmith show in that city in three years. So, we believe that’s why our shows end up holding their own is just the supply demand is so different than a Broadway show that has 400 opportunities for you to see it. So, we do believe in 2009 you will start to hear some sports, some of the other businesses may be affected in ticket sales but our concert business is looking very strong for 2009.  Now, remember 2008 was an incredibly good year for us versus 2007. So, for us to be saying that we think 2009 could deliver somewhere in the same level of events and/or attendants is a fairly strong number. But, as of so far we are dead on track with our 2008 tickets on sales and shows in the pipe.
David B. Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc.: Then you didn’t really touch on the announcement you made this morning with some of these new people coming in to the company. None of them seem to have much concert business experience but maybe you want to give some color on what you’re planning to do there.
Michael Rapino : It’s just really what we’ve been doing over the last three years. We’ve been really turning this company in to what – at the core we are a sales and distribution company. We’re outsourced, the artist hires us, we put a financial guarantee down and our job then is to go market the show, sell the tickets and maximize the onsite revenue. The challenge when we took over we realized were we had great people that knew how to buy shows but we did not have a great skills set to meet the needs of today from a marketing onsite revenue basis. So, hiring people from Disneyland, the Hilton, GE, those people are coming in here saying how do we drive per head revenue per square revenue from our existing business and how do we market those shows and break through the clutter and not market like we historically have with the print ad and radio spot but, how do we break clutter, sell more tickets and sell more per revenue per fan this summer. We’re trying to bring all that skill set in. We want to learn from whether it’s Starbucks or Disney, how do you drive your retail revenue.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC.
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: When I look at the balance sheet I’m seeing the deferred revenue at the end of the year is down from what it was at the end of the year in ’07 but then when I look at the cash flow statement it looks like it is a source of cash, can you help me reconcile those two? I’m trying to get a sense if deferred revenue is an indicator if you will of what ’09 looks like?
Kathy Willard : One of the items there is the way the discontinued operations work Ben is that the balance sheet is reflective of just the operations that we still have so it wouldn’t include theater, it wouldn’t include motorsports as our last year’s K would if you went back and looked at that. The cash flow statement however is not restated for discontinued operations so you kind of have the flows going through there. So, that’s really the big drive on there. But, all-in-all you’re only seeing a call it $30 million drop between years and that’s just really timing of ticket sales related to our core music business. 
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: So the balance sheet for ’07 was restated for the divestiture of those two businesses?
Kathy Willard : That’s correct.
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: So help me walk through, for me to feel comfortable that you think ’09 is pacing sort of similar to what ’08 was how do I look at the deferred revenue on the balance sheet and feel sort of comfortable on that?
Kathy Willard : Well, remember again you’re finishing fourth quarter and starting first and first is always a low quarter for us with the big seasonality in the amphitheaters and the festivals coming in in the second and third. So, those tickets sales would typically be going on first quarter and second quarter so it’s really the activity that’s going on right now that will impact more of the summer season.
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: But that was the same last year too, right? Because I mean after all I’m looking at the balance sheet from the yearend not from the quarter end.
Kathy Willard : That’s right. 
Benjamin Mogil – Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC: Is deferred revenue for you not a relatively good indicator of what you think the following year looks like? Or, are you saying the amount of the deferred revenue is basically only first and second quarter is so small that it gets swung around a lot?
Kathy Willard : It’s definitely a indicator but I’m saying that the seasonality impacts that so you can’t just look at one point of time being yearend and decide what the whole year is going to look like. As Michael said, our ticket sales for events kind of same time of year are flat to prior year. 
Michael Rapino : I think you can also feel good if there’s only a $30 million difference right now of deferred revenue off that spectacular 2008 then $30 million is a swing of one tour that could have been Q1 versus Q2. To be anywhere near that range is a great indicator but it wouldn’t be a substance indicator all in itself because it’s too early in the year.
Operator: There are no further audio questions at this time. I would now turn the call back to Mr. Michael  Rapino for closing remarks.
Kathy Willard : Thank you operator. We’re done. Thank you everyone for calling in.
Operator:  Thank you for joining today’s Live Nation fourth quarter conference call. You may now disconnect.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Rapino, chief executive officer.
Michael Rapino:  Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our 2008 Third Quarter Conference Call. On today’s call I’ll provide a summary of Live Nations strategic progress. Kathy Willard our CFO will then provide an update related to the company’s financials.  We reported solid financial and operating results for the third quarter despite the global economic slow down. We executed on our strategic plan and delivered substantial progress across the majority of metrics used to evaluate our business. We believe our performance was among one of the best in the global music industry. We continue to see improved fundamentals in our core business as a result of our laser focus on exiting non-core businesses and building excellence in execution in our core business. Our performance in the third quarter supports this. Our revenue and adjusted operating income margins grew during the quarter and our highlights include: we produced over 4,800 concerts compared to 4,100 last year, representing a 17% increase, total attendance grew by 6% to over 17.5 million; total sponsorship revenue and average revenue per sponsor demonstrated strong growth during the quarter up 13% and 5% respectively.  North America music operating income increased 10 million over the year and total ancillary revenue per fan at our amphitheaters and also total revenue per fan were both compared to last year. Live Nation’s mission is to maximize revenue generated by the live concert experience. Our business model is driven by monetizing our global distribution pipe. During the quarter was all about execution. We continued to demonstrate tangible progress executed against our three strategic priorities: growing revenue and adjusted operating income in our core business; investing in developing our online ticketing platform for our 2009 launch; and strengthening our balance sheet through additional sale of non-core businesses. And now I’ll update you on the three priorities. Growing our core business model has two key levers. The first lever is filling the pipe; the cost to acquire the live show. We continue to execute our strategy to fill our distribution pipe by a more effective buying of our artist’s rights at the optimal economic price and locking in both near and long term revenue streams while minimizing our risk.  During the quarter we were successful in that we acquired over 4800 live concerts versus 4100 which represents a 17% increase in show count. We’re looking at ancillary rights to the core live rights we’re acquiring to feed our artists service platform. We have close to over 800 ancillary rights that we acquired in the third quarter of 2008. Our concert lineup is solid for the remainder of the year and 73% of our total expected North American music shows and 65% of international music shows were completed as of the end of September. Our remaining concert schedule includes the North American leg of Madonna’s current tour, and fall dates for Coldplay’s tour. Demands for artist touring later in the year, including Coldplay, AC\DC, Elton John, and New Kids on the Block, remains robust. Madonna’s current tour started August 23rd in Europe and generated over all solid reviews, sellouts and added dates. Ticket sales and fan demand for the tour have been strong around the globe. Tour highlights include the highest grossing sale of all time at Wembley Stadium, the largest audience ever for a music concert in Switzerland, an incredible fan interest in South America that has resulted in multiple dates in every market. All in all Madonna’s tour has experienced a phenomenal global response and we continue to believe this tour will be Madonna’s biggest ever with the potential of grossing over $290 million in revenues versus $190 million from her 2006 tour.  The second lever of our business model is now monetizing the pipe. With our pipe full our job is to maximize our distribution pipe to generate strong returns. We generate strong returns in the pipe by executing five strategies. One is expanding our pipe. Our pipe now consists of over 57 countries where we promote events. We continue to strategically review our distribution platform, seeking expansion opportunities.  We expanded our pipe by signing an exclusive distribution deal with CIE the third largest concert promoters in the world and T4F. This deal extends our global reach by providing entry into several top Latin American markets including Brazil and Mexico, provides us with new revenue sources. We begin monetizing our global tours in a region where we historically had limited presence. Our global distribution pipe has expanded into more than 25 new markets as a result of this partnership and we gained access to rapidly growing music markets that serve a tremendous fan base. We also continued in our top 20 U.S. market expansions with agreement to operate the Bayfront Amphitheater in Miami. We’re currently making upgrades to the venue and look to open that in June of 2009. In our House of Blues franchise we opened a new one in Houston in October and Boston will open in 2009; giving us 12 locations. Our second strategy is to increase in tickets throughout the pipe. We demonstrated our ability to do this by growing attendance to 17.5 million attendees during the quarter versus 16.6 last year; an increase of 6%. Our third focus is reducing costs and improving efficiencies. Operating in North America music increased 10 million in the quarter as we increased the average profit per show by 33% partially driven by improved cost controls around talent buying and venue operating costs. Our marketing dollars are working harder for us and we’re generating a more efficient reach as we continue to optimize our marketing mix. We have reduced costs by a shift from traditional media outlets to online. Our customer database continues to grow and we’re focused on leveraging our database to more efficiently market our shows.  Our fourth strategy is increasing our in-venue revenues. Over all ancillary revenue per fan in our owned and operated amphitheaters grew slightly at $18.29 in total revenue per attendee and $89.79 in the third quarter versus $86.08 in the prior year; an increase of 4%. Considering the environment we’re against we are very pleased with this performance.  Our focus here remains the same; an increase in ancillary sales per fan in the food and beverage category while also promoting operating efficiencies. We reached the new concession contract with SMG saver and Aramark for managing food and beverage concession at 34 of our North American amphitheaters.  SMG and Aramark are two of the most successful and respected food and beverage operators in the world. We currently expect our new partnership to generate roughly 20% increase in adjusted operating income for our North American concession business while minimizing our business risk. Our final strategy in growing our core business is sponsorship. We believe the global sponsorship market possesses high growth potential and we have continued to improve our ability to develop long term national multi-platform sponsorship deals.  Our sponsorship recognized an increase of over 12% and our average sponsorship revenue per sponsor increased 5% which we believe is noteworthy given the wide spread decline in the advertising market.  We have 770 sponsors currently as of September, which is a 7% increase over last year. During the third quarter we announced we entered into a 10 year agreement with Telefonica 02 for the naming rights sponsorship of The Point in Dublin now to be called 02 Dublin Arena. We also announced today that 02 will be a strategic sponsor partnering with us on our AMG venues in the UK which we will rename all of 11 of them the 02 Academy. Our second priority is expansion into the ticketing and E-commerce platform to extend our pipe. Our ticketing platform remains on track for lots in January 1, 2009. The sale of our in-house tickets has increased 74% in the first nine months of 2008 compared to last year. Over the past several months we have made substantial progress implementing our third party ticketing strategy. We formed an exclusive agreement with SMG, the world’s leading venue management company, which will allow Live Nation to sell North American facilities controlled by SMG. The first tickets will transition into a Live Nation ticket in late 2009 and we expect to ramp up to an estimated five million tickets annually by 2011. The total tickets included in the deal amount to roughly 25 million over the term of the deal. In addition the incremental tickets included in that deal represent an estimated 25% annual increase over the 13 million tickets we expect in service in 2010 from our North American vendors.  We also secured a five year ticketed deal with Roseland Ballroom in New York that we’ll begin to handle in 2009. The Roseland Ballroom is one the premier mid-sized music venues in the country and hosts over 100 shows and draws over 100,000 fans annually.  We believe that these partnerships serve as a validation of our ticketing platform and demonstrate the benefits of offering a value proposition that combines a fist class ticketing service with the global live music leadership position.  Our third strategic priority is selling our non-core assets. Our final strategic priority is strengthening our balance sheet through these sales. With regard to asset divestitures, in early September we completed the sale of our motor sports division, which generated net proceeds of $168 million. We have also recently sold our non-music events division to Michael Cole for net proceeds of $15 million. The proceeds from both of these non-core asset sales will be used to reduce our debt and enhance our financial position as well as invest in our core business.  As Kathy will review in a moment we are comfortable with our balance sheet and financial flexibility. We have now completed the majority of our non-core asset sales while we will continue to explore select opportunities in the M&A market that will enable further our venue base we have no plans or no need to make any major acquisitions for the seeable future.  To conclude the concert industry continues to grow during the third quarter in spite of the economic downturn. We are carefully monitoring attendance trends given the recession but thus far we have not seen any major impact.  Our balance sheet is healthy and we’re going to remain prudent with regard to expense management without sacrificing our operating momentum. As I mentioned it’s all about execution for us at Live Nation. Our business model is producing tangible returns and our margins are improving. In addition, our pipeline is full, our share of artists is growing and we’re on track to launch our ticketing business in January. At the end of the day artists continue to receive the vast majority of their earnings from touring and remain eager to hit the road. The fans continue to come out and see them time after time, so we are optimistic about the near term and are very confident the steps we are taking to grow our business will in turn support our growth potential over the long term. And now Kathy will take you through our financial update.
Elizabeth K. Willard: Good afternoon and thank you everyone for joining us. During the third quarter consolidated revenue increased $136.1 million or 9.4% compared to the same period last year. The higher consolidated revenues were driven primarily by increases in the North American and international music groups due to show results along with some festival timing, and the results from our newer acquisitions with the decrease in Artist Nation driven by the tour activity. For the third quarter of 2008, our adjusted operating income was $109.6 million, an increase of $15.4 million as compared to $94.2 million during the third quarter of last year. This increase in adjusted operating income was driven primarily by the results of our newer acquisitions and improvements in both North American and international music operating results, partially driven by festival timing. Adjusted operating income was impacted by declines in Artist Nation due to timing of tours and also an increase in fixed costs and ticketing of $4.7 million, primarily due to the cost of building our new ticketing operations. Operating income increased 9.2% to $75.6 million from operating income of $69.2 million in the third quarter of 2007. This increase in operating income was due to the overall improvement and adjusted operating income partially offset by a $4.9 million reduction in the gain on sales as compared to last year. We concluded some small venue sales and also an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. During the third quarter we reported results from discontinued operations of $21.7 million. This includes the sale of our motor sports division in September 2008, as well as the impact of the October sale of our non-music, non-core events assets. The net tax benefit for the quarter reflects the use of NOLs to offset the majority of taxes that would otherwise be paid on the net gain on these sales. Overall our net income was $139.9 million for the third quarter, as compared to $41.6 million for the same period last year. Turning to the nine month results, consolidated revenue increased $414.7 million or 14.6% compared to the same period of last year. This increase was driven by overall growth in North American and international music, due to strong operating results and the impact of acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, due to foreign exchange movement. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decline in Artist Nation due to an overall decline in the volume of global tours in 2008. Our adjusted operating income was $141.7 million for the nine month, an improvement of $35.3 million compared to $106.4 million during the same period in '07. This increase was primarily driven by improvements in North American music operating results and due to the impact of our North American and international music acquisitions, partially offset by the increased fixed costs of $11.8 million related to building the ticketing operation. Our operating income for the nine months $33.2 million compared to $39.3 million for last year. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the gain on sale of operating assets due to a number of venue and other asset sales in 2007, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily for the amortization of intangible assets, on acquisitions, and certain artist right agreements. These decreases were offset by the overall improvement and adjusted operating income for the period. For the nine months we reported results from discontinued operations of $69.2 million, which includes the sale of the North American theater business, our motor sports division, and the October sale of our non music events assets. The net tax benefit for the period reflects the use of NOLs again to offset the majority of taxes that would otherwise be due on the net gain on these sales. Overall our net income was $105.8 million for the nine months as compared to $6.4 million in 2007. I now want to spend a few minutes discussing our other key financial information. As of September 30, our cash and cash equivalence balance was $205.9 million. Of this our free cash, which is essentially cash less event related items was $50.4 million, and free cash flow was $75.6 million as of September 30 which is a slight increase from the $70.1 million in 2007. Capital expenditures for the nine months were $138.6 million, which includes $21.7 of maintenance expenditures and $116.9 million of revenue generating projects. These revenue generating projects were primarily for the development and renovation of various venues during the year, including the O2 Dublin Arena, formerly The Point, and the two new House of Blues, in Houston and Boston, and also for our ticketing rollout. As Michael noted, we had completed the sale of our motor sport business in September for net sales proceeds received of $167.6 million and a future performance-based earn-out of up to $30 million over the next five years. These proceeds were used to permanently reduce our term loans by $26.8 million and to improve our overall liquidity to fund our core music operations. So during 2007 this business generated approximately $24.5 million of adjusted operating income and was expected to generate around the same amount for the full year of 2008. This business has now been reflected as discontinued operations in the current financial statement. We have also completed the sale of our non core, non music events business in October 2008, for $15.4 million to Michael Cole. This sale includes certain events assets, DVD projects and other rights. Based on the timing of this sale the impact has been reflected in the financial results as of September 30, including the right down value of the sold assets and related goodwill and the movement of the events business to discontinued operations. During the first nine months of 2008 we have incurred losses in this event business of approximately $11.6 million, which is now reflected as discontinued operations. Both of these sales reflect our continued commitment to execute on our strategy to sell our non-core assets and to improve our overall liquidity. As of September 30, 2008, our total long-term debt including outstanding redeemable preferred stock totaled $839.3 million. Overall we are confident that we are in a sound financial position as we have no mandatory debt repayment on our main facilities until 2012. Our debt at September 30 consists primarily of $421.6 million of term loans under our senior secured credit facility. We have a small amount of annual required payments under these term loans with no significant required repayment until 2013, $40 million of revolving loans under our senior secured credit facility – this revolver facility does not mature until 2012 and the revolver is used as needed for funding, working capital needs, and other requirements. As of today this balance is at $115 million. We have 13 banks and financial institutions that are lenders under this credit facility: $220 million under our 2.875% convertible senior notes, the holders of these notes cannot request repayment prior to 2014; $40 million of redeemable preferred stock which matures in 2011; and the remainder of approximately $118 million includes various other smaller notes and capital leases. Of this amount a significant portion is related to AMG in the UK, which we don't own all of and the majority of the AMG debt doesn't have any required repayment prior to 2010. Overall considering the impact of our interest rate swap agreement that we have in place as of September 30, 80.1% of our debt is at a fixed rate, with only 19.9% of floating rate debt, our overall weighted average cost of debt as of September 30 is 6.41%. Taking into account outstanding letters of credit of $41 million, as of today we have approximately $129 million available for future borrowings under our revolver. Our senior secured credit facility has three debt covenants: a senior leverage ratio; a total leverage ratio; and an interest coverage test. In addition our redeemable preferred stock instrument has a total leverage ratio which has slightly different terms than those under our senior facility. The calculations to support these are all as defined by the underlying agreement and I can confirm the terms are relatively consistent with other credit agreements that were entered into around the time that we became a public company. On an ongoing basis we perform detailed analysis of most of our business and overall trends and measure those against available headroom under our covenant. We are diligent in insuring we maintain a sufficient amount of headroom for each covenant through both a balance sheet and cash flow review. Our analysis is measured both against absolute dollar flexibility and in percentage terms with the goal of maintaining a comfortable allowance to accommodate unforeseen events. Prior to making any acquisitions or divestiture we run pro forma calculations for the effect of such events with this analysis in mind, and also consider the effects of such actions on our overall liquidity. Notwithstanding the fact that we are coming off the most capital intensive year in our history as a public company, I can confirm that as of September 30, we remain comfortably in compliance with all covenants, and based on our current projections for 2009 we have no concerns over complying with these covenants for the next year. Finally I would reiterate that we have no significant debt maturities under our primary debt instruments until June 2012, and that between now and then our covenant levels are set at today's level and do not tighten. We will continue to monitor potential impacts to our business from foreign currency fluctuation. Currently we use foreign currency hedges short-term to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations for shows where the artist is paid in a currency different than the tickets are sold in. Overall for the nine months ended September 30, we experienced a positive impact of $3.9 million to adjusted operating income from foreign exchange movement. We remain comfortable with our overall balance sheet and financial condition. We believe that our liquidity is adequate as we move into 2009. We don't feel that there is an immediate need to do any further acquisitions as we approach the end of our three year bill cycle, but we will continue to evaluate opportunities on a strategic basis for both acquisitions and use of revenue generating capital. Given the progress we've made over the past two years, we continue to believe that we will be in a position to deliver strong adjusted operating income, growth income in 2009 and beyond, as we continue to grow our core operations, realize the impact of investments and venues, and launch our ticketing operations. With that I will open up to questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of David Joyce – Miller Tabak and Company.  
David Joyce – Miller Tabak and Company. :  I was just wondering if there's any limitation on the volume of sponsorships, like would there get to be a point where there's too much clutter.
Michael Rapino: We don't think we're anywhere near there. We have estimated if, you look at the global sponsorship category and then break it down into the global music spend, various reports you can use, the global sponsorship category, somewhere in the $18 billion range. They estimate the music piece of that when you take all the sports stuff out, could be somewhere in the $1 to $2 billion range. So if we're the music leader in the world and we're still only running somewhere $100 million in sponsorship, we look at that as we're actually below market share and have a lot of room to increase the sponsorship. Now one of our strategies is we hope in three years we don't have 770 sponsors, maybe we have 370 sponsors, but we have gone into much deeper, longer relationships like Citi and 02 and Rogers that we're starting to do now which we have a much more online to on-stage sales platform.
David Joyce – Miller Tabak and Company. : And on another topic can you discuss where you are on digitally monetizing your venues for the live events?
Michael Rapino: It continues to be a project that we currently basically in this last year, our Live Nation studio division filmed numerous shows, and the way we are currently monetizing that strategy is through our mobile division on online. So Rogers in Canada has a very extensive program with us, where we feed them online shows to fulfill that sponsorship agreement. We have a deal in America where we have certain mobile carriers who pay us for online content and we're looking at more mobile companies around the world who are looking for that online content. We still are working on a much bigger project that says, how can we institutionalize the sale of the live show online and through mobile from both the video and audio and we believe that the future of that will come together soon.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alan Gould – Natixis.
Alan Gould – Natixis: A couple questions, first Michael a number of companies are saying they saw a meaningful change in their business in October. Did you just confirm that in ticket sales there was no real change after the month of October?
Michael Rapino: I'm not trying to deliver a message that we're somehow the only company in the world not affected by the economic down turn. I can only state the facts on what we sold to date. Now as you know 75% of our business happens in the summer. So we really don't really start selling anything of magnitude again until March or April when we sell the summer season. So in October, Coldplay, AC/DC tickets, you can't print them quickly enough. Coldplay sold out. Jonas Brothers sold out. So we have seen no ticket affect at all in October. We hope that by the time we start selling tickets in the spring that this trend continues.
Alan Gould – Natixis: Can you give us your view of what the acquisition of Frontline by Ticketmaster does in terms of the competitive mixing in the promotion business?
Michael Rapino:  Yes, we think it kind of validates our model slightly. I have a ton of respect for Irving Azoff. He's one of the greatest managers in the business and we do a lot of business with Irving. We love our business model. We think the combination of spending over $1 billion a year directly with the artist and then delivering a ticketing platform for them is a powerful combination for venues. We don't really see any change to our overlook. We still believe that venue, the artist and the fan would love an alternative ticketing company in this space. I think it's probably the only industry in the world that I can think of that doesn't have a good number two or number three. So we believe we still have a very powerful combination. I think Ticketmaster has over 9000 contracts, so success to us is pretty small in their world. We pick up a venue a month with our combination of real estate, content and ticketing; our business grows nicely. So our outlook remains the same. We expected them to make some moves. We think it’s good having Irving over at Ticketmaster because we have one common agenda. We do a lot of shows for Frontline and we would assume that we’ll continue to want to do what's right for the artist.
Alan Gould – Natixis: Okay and last question, can you give us any idea of what the coming tour schedule in 2009 supposed to be a very big year; is there any more info you can give us on that?
Michael Rapino:  No, we're in lots of conversations that could be lots of tours happening next year. I wouldn't tell you that anything I know today says it’s going to be bigger or smaller than this year. Meaning there might be a couple extra tours. I think AC/DC will continue to tour well into 2009 which will be a gigantic tour, but what we're seeing right now, the good news that we always go is will it be at least as good as this year and everything were seeing we see that next year should be at least as good as this year and if we get lucky we'll get a couple of extra tours that would put it over top. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jim Boyle – CL King 
Jim Boyle – CL King:  How could this recession’s likely impact compared to past recession's impact in your core business since you been doing this for a while?
Michael Rapino: Up until a month ago we used to say that historically the concert business is not affected by recessions if you look at ticket sales over the last 20 years that it’s been recorded. I guess only in the last month I'd say it's gotten a little worse than just the average recession. So we don't want to over promise, but factually over the last 20 years, when a recession has come around, ticket sales have not been affected. Now we go to two facts. One, the average customers goes to one or two shows a year. It's not like going to the movies; it's a very planned outing.  So the show tonight in LA at Dodger Stadium with Madonna is sold out in LA and those people that's their one or two chances a year where they have to go out and have that Kodak moment. We think the fan still wants to do that and is still motivated in that. And also people forget that the concert business, although it receives a lot of attention, out of the 300 million people in America if you want to use that as a base, we're wildly successful when we sale 40 million tickets; and the average customer buys two tickets, so that's 20 million tickets. He goes to two shows so it's 10 million consumers out of 300 million make our business work. We think those consumers actually can still afford and will go to one or two shows next year and we haven't seen anything in history that says they don't go when economic times are bad.
Jim Boyle – CL King: I know, you mentioned all of 2009 you hope to see it be at least as good as this year and then perhaps that if you got a little lucky. How does early '09 look if you have that visibility perhaps just into Q1?
Michael Rapino:  We historically haven't gone and given that kind of guidance but I mean as I said it's still quite early, believe it or not, for 2009 for artists. But I would just tell you that the amount of activity, the chatter, the could-be deals, the talk-about deals, the talk-about tours is consistent today as it's been last year and the year before, but how many and what tours will go out next year. So we haven't seen any artist, in any way, not want to go out next year.  If anything, as I stated in my release, remember the going on the road is the way the artist make a living and in most cases this is why he'd want to get out next year and continue to find a way to make a living, at least on the road while he may be finding tougher means thru record sales and other categories in his P&L to make money on next year.
Jim Boyle – CL King: Okay and finally Kathy, although you mention there are several caps could you at least remind us, please, on the senior leverage cap and the total leverage cap vis-à-vis what your Q3 position was? 
Elizabeth K. Willard: You mean as far as where we are actually are on the covenant?
Jim Boyle – CL King:  Correct, versus the actual covenant.
Elizabeth K. Willard: We don't put out that kind of detail, Jim, but I would just tell you that we're in compliance and we’re comfortable with the headroom that we have.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of David Kasbaum – Morgan Joseph.
David Kasbaum – Morgan Joseph:  Michael can you talk about the SMG deals, maybe give us some color on the economics or exactly how you won that deal?
Michael Rapino: Yes, the SMG deal is a great venue management company. Their core competency is managing venues. They are not in the ticketing business so they outsource ticketing. Part of the SMG business model is when they go into venues to try to win their contract, the key to winning a contract is to convince that venue that you're going to increase their revenue. So, you're going to operationally do great by running a better ship, but the biggest way any venue is going to probably drive it's economic bottom line is to put a few more shows in.  So again our fundamental proposition that SMG was attracted to is can we help them put a few more shows in their existing client base? That's a big win for them. So, we approached them on that basis that said let us help put some shows in your buildings. In return, we want to be the preferred ticketing company. So I can tell you we didn't pay a dollar more than market rate to get the ticketing rights. We don't have any contractual payments or mandates on how many or what type of shows we have to put in there because the third piece of the pie is SMG and Aramark bid on the concession food and beverage for our amphitheaters. So as we went to market us doing a bidding war for who would be the new concessionaire at our venues, we had great leverage with SMG that in return they delivered market value on the concession business and we put them in our food and beverage business.  We in turn would want to be in the ticketing business, so it was a strategic move on how could we leverage outsourcing our food and beverage contract, not pay a dollar more and get the ticketing rights to their buildings.
David Kasbaum – Morgan Joseph:  With this deal with Michael Cole now, is he totally unaffiliated with Live Nation or is he still consulting or involved in some way?
Michael Rapino: Oh not at all I want to make that clear as day. Michael still has an eight-year non-compete. We have consulting arrangement with Michael Cole. He is in Florida still, in regular contact. We have been trying to for the last year so we used to have it in the other line in our P&L. We had a bunch of misfit non-music events that have been accumulated over the Clear Channel days from theater and exhibitions, bodies exhibit, traveling dinosaurs; a whole bunch of events that are non-core, have drastically been a drag on our earnings not performing and we had been looking for a strategic seller for a while. Michael has historically been in that business and we sold him that business. It's a non-music business event driven. So he will own and run that but as far as anything to do with the music business, we are bound to a non-compete together and hopefully Michael is out there trying to do what he does best for Live Nation and find the right tour to fill our pipe and we will work together on those tours as he generates them.
David Kasbaum – Morgan Joseph:  Just a few for Kathy. Kathy, what happened to the fully diluted shares, because they went up pretty significantly, I think from 76 million, 77 million, to like 84 million during the quarter?
Elizabeth K. Willard: It’s various options and then stocked under our artist rights agreements that we've announced.
David Kasbaum – Morgan Joseph: Can you talk about to the cash, because you received $200 million I guess from the two asset sales, yet the cash balance went down? I know most of that's related to deferred revenue, but I still would have expected maybe a little pay down in the debt this quarter.
Elizabeth K. Willard: Well, yes, what you're really seeing now is you're seeing the seasonal decline in cash that you would normally see in this quarter, and the sales proceeds basically allowed us to free up liquidity and pay down some of the user revolver that we had been – in addition to the permanent term pay down of about $27 million that we talked about.
David Kasbaum – Morgan Joseph: And do you think you'll give guidance on '09 on sometime during the first quarter like you did last year?
Elizabeth K. Willard: Yes, David, we're still talking about that. That would be the timing for it if we do it.
Operator: Your first question comes from Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management.
Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management: I had a couple questions for you about debt structure. On your press release you have on your cash flows from financing, I notice that for the nine months you have $300 million of debt paid down and several hundred of long-term debt issued off of here. I'm trying to see if I can get reconciliation from the numbers I've seen. I can't quite get all those numbers to add up.
Elizabeth K. Willard: And what's going on there is most of that is revolver draws and pay downs, and so as we do that activity they show up on those separate lines rather than getting netted down.
Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management: So it's basically revolver draws and revolver pay downs, they're not new leases or anything else being incurred?
Elizabeth K. Willard: Nothing substantial.
Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management: What is the current balance on the first lien term loan?
Elizabeth K. Willard: We don't break down between the two pieces, but the total is about $440 million. 
Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management:  You don't bread down between which two pieces, the revolver and term loan?
Elizabeth K. Willard: No there's two pieces of the term loan, sorry I thought that's what you were asking, but the total term loans are $421.6 million as of September.
Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management: You have a first lien and a second lien?
Elizabeth K. Willard: No. It's just that term loan that has two pieces that balloon in six months apart in 2013.
Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management: And those are equally parity and priority?
Elizabeth K. Willard: Correct.
Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management: And your total debt outstanding is $839 million I believe you said?
Elizabeth K. Willard: That's correct, and that includes the redeemable preferred stock.
Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management: That's why your balance sheet it does not add up to the $839 million. The difference is redeemable preferred?
Elizabeth K. Willard: Yes, you have to pick up that $40 million of redeemable preferred.
Steven Pfeiffer – Wells Capital Management: And what is the redeemable preferred maturity?
Elizabeth K. Willard: It is in 2011.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs.
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: Michael, I was wondering, could you talk to some of the recent industry announcements, I guess like the SMG and Frontline that we were just talking about, could be interpreted as a fight over the ticket. So longer term, can you help us think about where you think the right to sell the ticket will reside? With the artists, or the venue, the promoter, what's the difference? How does it shake out here and then internationally?
Michael Rapino: We believe that there's two pieces of the business. Internationally the ticket is usually owned by the promoter, and in America the ticket has been attached to the building; really a Ticketmaster strategy that was 20 or 30 years ago. We believe a couple things that say why we would want to enter that business. We believe that that business like anything, if there's only one participant in it there's room for a number two. We believe that the opportunity to deliver a different model on pricing is a huge opportunity in the future for the fan and artist. And we believe ultimately that the artist that is going on tour and in partnership with whoever is writing the check for that tour will want to participate in the service fee in the secondary tickets of the future. Historically the secondary market the artist has not participated in, and in service fees to date, there are zero participation by the artist. So we believe that our cost of goods, which is the billion plus we're spending with the artist, gives us the incredible leverage to talk to the artist about the ticket and what we should do with both the secondary and the primary and how we can make both of our pots bigger. So I think you're going to see in the future the touring artist expect to be included in some level of the ticket and the secondary ticket. And we long ago believed that our value was those 1,500 artists that we’re paying annually to go on the road and to make them as much money as possible and thus get our slice of the pie. And we think that that's going to be important going forward is to be able to have a business model that can compensate the artist to participate in the ticket and still make your return.
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: So just wondering hypothetically, what happens today if a top ten artist goes on tour and says I want Live Nation to be my promoter and I want you to do my ticketing, and then it goes to a third-party venue that has a ticketing arrangement with XYZ ticketing? What's the outcome?
Michael Rapino: Today the venue controls the ticketing rights and whatever relationship they would have with Ticketmaster, so when Madonna plays in a building we honor whatever ticketing contractual arrangement that building would have. Some are Ticketmaster and some aren't. Now the artist currently gets to at times sell up to 10% of their own tickets, so a pre-sale arrangement and we think that's an incredible opportunity for us to service for the artist. And in most cases the artist historically have had leverage, and we believe that the basics to our model is there are more buildings than there are artists, and the artists have incredible power and leverage in the future, and we'll expect to be participant in that service fee in some sense, and to date that has not happened. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from [Robert Burns] – [Colt Advisory].
[Robert Bernsons] – [Colt Advisory]: A little bit of a follow up to the discussion about ticketing. I'm trying to better understand the competitive dynamics of the ticketing business. To the extent that your competitive efforts hit directly at Ticketmaster and other competitors, could that lead to meaningfully lower pricing and margins than you even expect, and that basically lowers the potential of your business and obviates its worthiness as a business plan?
Michael Rapino: Well that's a heck of a thesis. No, not at all. I think when we entered this business, the business school has taught us all that competition will probably create a lower price and a lower margin, so we have no fantasy that we are going to take on the number one company for 30 years and not incur a margin contraction in that segment. We believed our competitive advantage is we are in a 4% margin business promoting 20,000 shows. We believe that entering the ticket segment, which is a 25% plus margin business, is a great vertical expansion for us. And we are very happy to enter that segment and grow our business model somewhere between 4% and 25% margin, and have a very effective and growing business as a result of it. I would not want to be in the business of trying to defend how I will maintain a 25% margin in that business, because high margin has historically been a great result of only one player in the space. We believe that competition will drive a better price for the fan, and marked participation from the artist. And we believe that if we're paying for the artist to get on the road, we have a great advantage in entering that space and growing our 4% margin.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tuna Amobi – Standard & Poor Equity Group
Tuna Amobi – Standard & Poor Equity Group: As you think about next year, can you perhaps talk what you'll spend in terms of a number of shows that you expect to put on, and what kind of attendance? Assuming that you have the same number of shows that you had this year, do believe that the organic growth in attendance is going to be substantially better for next year, and if so what are the drivers of that? And the next question that I have is on secondary ticket and market. I know that, Michael, you just talked about your plans for that, but just a larger picture on how you see that secondary market evolving. I know there's been a lot of noise earlier this year about some of the goings on, but do you see, in terms of how it evolved, do you believe that there's going to be more consolidation, because it seems awfully fragmented right now, and if you could also talk about your strategy to become a bigger player in that segment would be helpful?
Michael Rapino: I'll try to summarize. I think your first question I can summarize into one category that says – we expect the business to be as healthy next year as it is this year from both a show count, which obviously then drives an attendance result. So we hope to deliver a stable business next year in the same range of this year in terms of metrics, and then our job is figure out how to grow the revenue per that attendee, and we've kind of laid out those strategies as in my release on how we continually build that model. The secondary, we've stated we absolutely believe it's got a great opportunity for us. Not because we think the category is that big in the end of the day, but we have a zero market share right now. So we do believe that the secondary market in the major markets around the great shows, we are currently not participating, nor is the artist participating on Madonna's secondary tickets in the marketplace in L.A. tonight. We would love to be in a situation to capture the thousands of dollars in premiums that are being spent in L.A. for the Madonna show to participate with Madonna and have our slice of that pie, so we will have a partner platform in the future where we will be able to sell and participate in those tickets, and finally start getting some of that revenue – high margin revenue – around those great shows in the great cities in the great venues.
Tuna Amobi – Standard & Poor Equity: Are there any potential legal issues that you'd have to navigate maybe on stateside or even internationally to be able to achieve what you just said?
Michael Rapino: No, it's a global business and globally eBay has institutionalized that consumer trading business.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Rapino do you have any closing remarks?
Michael Rapino: No.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call, you may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-09-15 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Michael Rapino - President and Chief Executive Officer Kathy Willard - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts:  Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs David Joyce – Miller Tabak and Company Alan Gold – Natixis Dingli Chen – Marsico Capital 
Operator:   Welcome everyone to the Live Nation second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions)  Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings for a description of risks and uncertainties that can impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some nonGAAP measures in this call. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation for the most comparable GAAP measure in the earnings release on their website. The release reconciliation and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found on livenation.com under the "About Us" section.  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael Rapino, Chief Executive Officer.
Michael Rapino: On today's call I'll provide a summary of Live Nation's strategic and financial progress. Kathy Willard, our CFO, will then take you through the financials. First and foremost, we are pleased to report that live music remains healthy, particularly given the continued economic slowdown that has impacted so many consumer-oriented businesses. As expected, concert attendance and program revenue had held up very well; and the pace of ticket sales remains robust in the current quarter. During the quarter, our performance supports this. We produced over 5,800 concerts during the second quarter compared to approximately 4,100 last year, representing a 42 percent increase. Live Nation's total attendance at these events increased 14% yearoveryear to 13.7 million, and our total revenue per fan attending these concerts increased 6% over prior year. During the second quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic priorities. Number one, growing revenue and adjusted operating income in our core distribution platform; two, investing in and developing our online ticketing platform ahead of our 2009 launch; and three, strengthening our balance sheet through additional sales of noncore businesses. On the last point, as we have stated in the past, we are not in a position to disclose the status of our potential motor sports sales. I will confirm, however, the sale process started several months ago; and we are continuing to evaluate our options. Live Nation's mission is to maximize revenue generated by live concert experience. Our business model is driven by monetizing our global distribution pipe serving three clients, artists, fans, and sponsors. Our distribution pipe has two levers, acquiring, producing artists' rights at the right economic price and, two, optimizing and expanding our pipe. We will soon add a third lever, ticketing online ecommerce retailing. I will take you through a summary of our first lever, artist live right acquisition. Our North American concert season has been very strong to date. Five of the top ten grossing tours through June were Live Nation tours, including Van Halen, Jay-Z/Mary J. Blige tour. We have a substantial summer season this far and remain confident in our upcoming concert schedule. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy to fill our distribution pipe with the right artists at the right economic price, locking in revenue streams over the near and long term. We transitioned from a single promoter business with approximately 1,000 artists and one right, the concert right, into an organization that has resources to attract, on average, two rights from over 1,200 artists. We expect our share of the artists' rights to continue to grow in the live music space. The healthy place of ticket sales that we saw in the first half has continued into the important third quarter, and our concert lineup is solid for the remainder of the year. Madonna's "Sticky & Sweet" tour starts August 23 in Europe, and the tour comes to North America in October. Ticket sales for Madonna's concerts have been exceptionally strong. As of early August, her tour has now surpassed 1.3 million tickets sold, very impressive sales to date. We continue to believe this tour will be Madonna's biggest ever, with the potential of grossing over $240 million in total revenues. In addition to Madonna, Coldplay's tour is on sale; and the summer dates are 90% sold out and will continue into the fall. We also have great tours by New Kids on the Block, the Jonas Brothers, Journey, John Mayer, and Rascal Flatts. We recently added Nickelback and Shakira to longterm rights deals. They join a roster that already includes Madonna, Jay-Z, and U2. Under the Nickelback partnership, we secured 11 separate artist rights to feed our global distribution platform, including touring, touring sponsorship, tour merchandise, tour VIP travel packages, secondary tickets, recorded music, clothing, licensing, and other retail merchandise, nontour sponsorship endorsements, DVD, broadcast rights, fan club, web rights. We currently expect our approximately tenyear, threecycle agreement with Nickelback to generate over $700 million in revenue and over $60 million in operating income, representing a margin of 9% and IRR of 32. Our partnership with Shakira spans ten artist rights, including touring, tour merchandise, secondary tickets, recorded music, licensing, retail merchandise, nontour sponsorship endorsements, DVD and broadcast, fan club, website. We currently expect our tenyear deal with Shakira to generate over $800 million in revenue and over $110 million in operating income, representing a margin of 13% and an IRR of 14. These deals put us on track in meeting our goals of signing a total of four to six major artists to a longterm, multiplerights deal in 2008. We believe that all these deals improve upon our longterm visibility and cash flow growth, potentially by allowing us to lock in multiple revenue streams, higher margin revenue with reduced risks. On average, each of these longterm deals has ten artist rights. Now that we have the pipe full, our focus is on optimizing the second lever, our distribution pipe. We have a broad global presence that consists of over 94 outlets around the world. We continue to strategically review our distribution platform, seeking expansion opportunities as well as potential areas to contract in order to optimize our asset base.  We will grow our revenue in the pipe by executing on five strategies. Our first is our continued expansion of our platform. In this quarter, we solidified our leadership position in Sweden by acquiring remaining interests in Luger and Moondog Entertainment, which adds significant promotion and festival experience to Live Nation Sweden. We expanded our global festival footprint to 30, as we acquired a controlling interest in Main Square Festival in France. We also successfully launched Pemberton, a Europeanstyle, threeday festival outside of Vancouver, headlined by Coldplay, Tom Petty, and Jay-Z with a firstyear success of 40,000 people, incredible for its first year. We've also been very successful in increasing show and ticket sales. We produced 42% more shows in the second quarter, and our total attendance increased by 14% in the second quarter versus last year. Our third strategy for growth in our pipe is delivering improved operating income and has been our focus on reducing operating costs and increasing operating efficiency. We have reduced our perhead operating cost in our amphitheaters by 2% this past quarter versus last year. We've also reduced our marketing cost by continuing to optimize our marketing strategy and shift all our traditional media channels to online, which provides a more efficient reach. Our customer database has grown to over 25 million unique music fans, and we remain dedicated to using our database and portfolio online services to reach marketing consumers more effectively. Our fourth strategy is increasing our invenue revenues. Overall, ancillary revenues per fan at our amphitheaters are pacing ahead of last year at 17.46 per head. We are very optimistic about our prospects for the second half. Our fifth strategy for the pipe is growing our sponsorship base. We continue to improve our ability to develop national, multiplatform sponsorship deals with major corporations. We believe that the global sponsorship market continues to hold high growth potential for Live Nation. During the quarter, we executed on 623 sponsorship deals; and we remain on track to close over 1,000 deals in 2008.  In this quarter, we closed a significant sponsorship deal in Ireland. The newly renovated Point Theater in Dublin has been renamed “The 02” and is expected to open in December. The venue was renamed as part of a strategic alliance with Telefonica 02 Ireland and was Ireland's first major naming rights deal. The third and new lever to our business model will become ticketing and fan retailing. We have made progress with our ticketing buildout and remain on track for our launch in less than five months. Ticketing will complete our transformation as an artisttofan direct relationship. The sale of our inhouse ticketing has increased 74% in the first half of 2008 as compared to last year.   To conclude, the concert industry remains healthy. The live concert industry has grown at a 10% compounded annual growth rate during the past decade, and we believe it will grow again this year. With artists relying more and more on touring for the majority of their earnings and motivating them to get of the road, Live Nation is positioned in the sweet spot for the first time in history. Our outlook is very positive. Our business is solid, our core performance is improving, our pipeline is full, and we're on pace to take over our ticketing operation in less than five months. Ticketing will complete our connection to the fan, and we believe it accelerates our growth profile for the benefit of our shareholders. I will now turn it over to Kathy, who will comment on the financials.
Kathy Willard: Before I begin reviewing our financial results, I would like to direct all of you to the second page of our earnings release, which contains a number of the key metrics related to our business for the second quarter and sixmonth period. These metrics include the number of music concerts and artist ancillary rights that we have secured, ancillary revenue per fan in our amphitheaters, total revenue per fan, and an update on our sponsorship initiative. We believe these metrics will provide better insight into our business and performance as we continue executing on our growth strategy.  Also, we will now refer to our reportable segments as North American Music; International Music; Artist Nation, which we formerly called the Global Artist; and Ticketing, formerly known as Global Digital. Moving to our financial results, overall, our net income is $1.2 million for the second quarter as compared to $9.9 million for the same period last year. Without the $19.3 million in gains on sale of certain assets we made in 2007, our net income would show an increase this year, even while we were incurring additional costs related to our Ticketing rollout.  During the second quarter, consolidated revenue increased $173.5 million, or 18%, compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a $95.1 million increase due to strong amphitheater and arena events in North American Music, due to increased event attendance, invenue ancillary spending, and higher ticket prices.  Acquisitions accounted for $123.9 million of this increase and includes $58 million from HOB Canada in North American Music; $28.6 million from AMG, DF Concerts, and Heineken Music Hall in International Music; and $37.3 million from Signatures and Anthill in Artist Nation. In addition, we benefited from an increase of $37.2 million related to foreign exchange movements, primarily in International Music.  These improvements were partially offset by a $19.2 million decline in International Music, which is driven by timing of festivals in the UK and Belgium and the closure of the Point in Ireland for renovation, and also a $40.5 million decline in the volume of global tours for Artist Nation. The shift in timing of the festivals in International Music also impacts the comparability of the festival attendance quarteroverquarter. For the second quarter of 2008, our adjusted operating income was $58.4 million, an improvement of $17.8 million compared to adjusted operating income of $40.6 million during the second quarter of last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by a $5.7 million increase related to our acquisitions of HOB Canada in North American Music, AMG and Heineken Music Hall in International Music, and Signatures and Anthill in Artist Nation.  We also had a $34.9 million improvement in North American Music operating results driven by strong amphitheater and arena due to increased event attendance, reduction in pershow operating costs, and also a reduction in fixed expenses related to legal and other cost reductions.  Partially offsetting this increase was an $8.1 million decline in International Music due to the timing of festivals and the closure of the Point and a $6.2 million decline due to the timing of global tours and increased salary and consulting expenses related to building the infrastructure for our artist services business. In addition, we experienced a decrease in our other operations of $6.4 million for our nonmusic related events division, due primarily to reduced results related to nonmusic touring productions. We are in the process of selling or shutting down these productions. Operating income decreased 26.4% to $23.7 million from operating income of $32.2 million in the second quarter of 2007. This decrease in operating income was primarily driven by an $18.4 million decrease in gain on sale of operating assets, primarily due to gains recorded in 2007 on the sales of three music venues and an office building, partially offset by a loss in 2007 on the sale of a noncore asset.  Also, we had an $8.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due primarily to an increase in amortization expense for Artist Nation in tangible assets related to the acquisitions of CPI and various artist rights agreements. These items were partially offset by the previously discussed $17.8 million overall improvement in adjusted operating income. Moving to the sixmonth results. For the six months ended June 30, consolidated revenue increased $289.7 million or 19%, compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a $110 million increase in North American Music due to strong results from arena tours and an increase in event attendance and average ticket prices at our owned and our operated amphitheaters and thirdparty venues.  Acquisitions accounted for $201.2 million of the increase and include $94.9 million from HOB Canada in North American Music; $44.7 million from AMG, DF Concerts, and Heineken Music Hall in International Music; and $61.6 million from Signatures and Anthill in Artist Nation. In addition, we benefited from an increase of $54.1 million related to foreign exchange movements, primarily in International Music. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a $21.8 million decline in International Music driven by timing of festivals in the UK and Belgium and the closure of the Point in Ireland for renovation, a $17.8 million decrease in the volume of global tours for Artist Nation, and a $17.6 million decline in our other operations driven by the loss of revenues on a noncore asset sold last year and fewer productions and touring shows in our UK theater operations. For the six months ended June 30, our adjusted operating income was $56.4 million, an improvement of $18.5 million compared to adjusted operating income of $37.9 million during the same period in 2007. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by a $36.2 million increase in North American Music due to strong results from arena tours and an increase in events and attendance at our owned and our operated amphitheaters and thirdparty venues; and a reduction in pershow operating costs and a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses for other cost reductions; and a $9.9 million increase due to the acquisitions of HOB Canada in North American Music, AMG, and Heineken Music Hall in International Music, and Signatures and Anthill in Artist Nation. Partially offsetting these increases is an $11.5 million decline in International Music due to the timing of festival event days and the closure of the Point in Ireland, partially offset by increased promotion activity in the United Kingdom due to strong stadium events. And a $10.1 million decline due to reduced volume in global tours and increased salary and consulting expenses related to building the infrastructure for our Artist Nation artist services business. And $3.1 million of additional cost to build our infrastructure in Ticketing. In addition, we experienced a decrease in our other operations of $8.5 million for our nonmusic related events division due primarily to lower results related to these nonmusic touring productions. Our operating loss for the six months ended June 30 was $14.8 million compared to a loss of $4.6 million for the same period in 2007.  This increase in the loss of $10.2 million was primarily driven by a $12.4 million decrease in the gain on sale of operating assets compared to the same period of the prior year due to gains recorded in 2007 on the sale of three music venues and two noncore assets and a $16.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due primarily to increased amortization expense in our Artist Nation and International Music segments for amortization of intangible assets on the AMG and CPI acquisitions, along with intangible rights related to artist rights agreements. These decreases were partially offset by the $18.5 million overall improvement in adjusted operating income noted above. Turning to some other financial metrics, capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30 were $76.1 million which include $19 million of maintenance expenditures and $57.1 million of revenue-generating projects including the renovation of the Point in Ireland; the development of our HOB locations in Houston and Boston; the new AMG venue in Sheffield, England; as well as the cost of our ticketing rollout. Revenue-generating projects for the remainder of 2008 will include these HOB venue expansions, the Hollywood Palladium, the ticketing rollout, and AMG venue expansions in Brighton, Sheffield, and Leeds. We continue to expect that our total revenue-generating capital expenditures will be approximately $155 million for 2008. We remain focused on controlling maintenance capital expenditures and continue to expect total maintenance capital expenditures for 2008 to be approximately $30 million. As of June 30, 2008, our reported cash and cash equivalents balance was $453.4 million and our debt and preferred stock totaled $834.1 million.  Free cash flow, which is adjusted operating income less net interest expense, cash taxes, maintenance capital expenditures, and net distributions and contributions with minority interest partners and nonconsolidated affiliates, was $25.7 million during the second quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect to generate modest growth in adjusted operating income and also expect to invest this growth back into our ticketing, digital ecommerce, and Artist Nation initiatives as we have previously stated. For 2008, as we previously noted, we expect our ticketing initiative to have an approximately $15 million negative impact to 2008 adjusted operating income.  Given the progress we've made over the past two years and our current investment plans, we continue to believe that we will be in a position to deliver strong adjusted operating income growth in 2009 and beyond. With that, I will open up to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Wienkes with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Wienkes Goldman Sachs: It's clear to see improvement in the metrics on the core business this quarter. What are the risks that you see of that not repeating in the third quarter? And then on ticketing, you note in the release the Pemberton festival was ticketed internally. What are the data points you have that give you confidence that your company is on plan to roll that out in January?
Michael Rapino: On Q3, given it's already August and July is in the books and all the tickets are sold and people coming, we believe that Q3 will finish as strong as Q2 in terms of per head concessions and ticket sales. So we're confident that we'll deliver our plan and maintain those numbers for Q3. Ticketing on plan is, I like to remind people, we already do inhouse ticketing. Through our relationship with Ticketmaster, we do get to sell 10% of our tickets through a registered fan club mechanism. As I stated in my release, the good news is we have increased this year versus last year over 74% of the tickets that we are doing inhouse from last year. We've got full staffing in place in all of our venues and our box of offices. We know we do ticket already; we ticketed Bonnaroo, we ticketed Pemberton. We believe once we have this new software platform from CTS, the upgrades and the implementation, we'll provide all of the scale and resources we need to handle our full load next year. So we are fully on track on execution, cost and transition, and see no stumbling blocks right now.
Mark Wienkes Goldman Sachs: Is there any early look at the timing of the rollout for third-party ticketing?
Mark Rapino: Because of our scale, when you have figured out how to handle 20 million tickets of your own at Live Nation, adding a venue or two becomes the easy part. We would expect that when we're open for business for Live Nation, we'd also be open for business for some of the business partners that we're currently in business with, supplying them with 30 or 40 shows a year and having lots of those conversations already.
Mark Wienkes Goldman Sachs: Two quick followups for Kathy, is the 42% of your increase in concerts and the 14% bump in attendance pro forma for HOB and AMG, etc., or do you have a pro forma number?
Kathy Willard: I don't have the pro forma number with me, that is actual numbers.
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: And then the free cash balance. Last year was negative as well as this year. Can you just remind us how that works with respect to the covenants and how they look at free cash?
Kathy Willard: The free cash doesn't impact the covenants. Remember, free cash, at this point there's a lot of different revenue on the balance sheet. As we play out those events in Q3, then you would expect that to come more into cash flow.
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: And the actual calculation, you're able to use some of the cash that's on the balance sheet?
Kathy Willard: Yes
Operator: Your next question comes from David Joyce with Miller Tabak and Company.
David Joyce – Miller Tabak and Company: One of my questions was to clarify what's in the amortization of artist rights. What part of the rights would be paid up front that gets amortized over time?
Kathy Willard: It's the nonrecoupable portion.
David Joyce – Miller Tabak and Company: So, for example, something like a Jay-Z, what would a non recoupable portion be?
Kathy Willard: We haven't given out the individual on those artists. If there was a nonrecoupable portion paid up front, then we would amortize it.
David Joyce – Miller Tabak and Company: Generally, I think, you've talked about the billion dollars or so in buying the artist rights per year, so this $8.9 million figure, it's pretty immaterial?
Michael Rapino: Absolutely, that has been our point for a while that we are in the business of advancing artists for their concert rights. We do that every day. We pay in advance for whether it's the show in two months in Cleveland or whether it's the Coldplay tour, and the only difference is we've now extended those relationships to a longer period and have an advance schedule forward. But the net, upfront money is insignificant to the amount of money we advance on a daily basis for our core business.
Kathy Willard: That $8.9 million you're quoting includes intangible assets on regular acquisitions, too.
David Joyce – Miller Tabak and Company: Another question, I don't know if it's too sensitive, but are you seeing increased competition for artist rights or the larger 360 deals from the likes of your regular venue competitors or from Ticketmaster at this point like Frontline management?
Mark Rapino: We haven't, Frontline controlled by Irving, we would be his largest business partner. We have a very good relationship. Some of our biggest tours are Frontline tours, Jimmy Buffet this summer, Def Leppard, and Neil Diamond, etc. Frontline is just a great supplier to us. Ticketmaster, we would assume they'll stay if their core business of ticketing. We haven't seen anyone else approach any of these artists in terms of a touring longterm relationship.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alan Gold with Natixis.
Alan Gold - Natixis: I would like to followup on the competitive environment. You struck four of the 360 deals so far, are you seeing any competitive response out there?
Michael Rapino: I think the record labels are definitely talking to a lot of their younger artists, as they're signing artists, about increasing some of their share of the artist's pie. They're in that business and doing that, probably on a more junior-artist basis. But the artists that are established touring artists that we probably already have a longterm relationship with or looking to have one with, we haven't seen anyone step up into that plate.
Operator: I have a follow up question from Mark Wienkes with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: Can you talk to the mix shift in terms of concert or attendance per concert, does that continue through Q3? Is that mainly because of the acquisitions? And then the timing of the payback on the growth capital that you're throwing out there this year? Not throwing, investing, bad choice of words.
Michael Rapino: I will start with the second question and come back to the first. It's more black and white. As we stated this year, our goal was to invest fixed costs in our ticketing division. Staffing out, basically, to be ready to handle our load next year, somewhere in the $15 million range of additional fixed costs. All of our numbers, you could have added $15 million to the bottom line if you wanted to look at it on a pure basis. And about $20 million in capital, and we would assume that has a oneyear payback.  We would be recouping all that and into money by the end of year one, which is why we chose this strategy versus a large acquisition strategy or an outsourcing strategy. The growth is incredible and the investment/payback is an incredible metric to be in the money after year one. Second, you said a mix of shows or mix of concessions?
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: Average attendance per show. Real quickly, on the growth capital with AMG, House of Blues, it's just the timing of when those opened and when you expect them to start contributing cash flow as well?
Kathy Willard: The Point will open the end of this year, we'll see that come in line strongly in 2009. Then the two House of Blues open the end of this year and beginning of next; and AMGs will open beginning of next year, so they all turn around pretty quickly.
Michael Rapino: And I think your question was, is the attendance, the revenue per attendance mix, is it organic. Is that the question?
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: The attendance is up 14% and concerts are up 42%, so it says that the attendance is at a lot more shows that are smaller in size.
Michael Rapino: Right.
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: Trying to see where you expect to continue and where you're taking the business?
Michael Rapino: I think it's a combination. We said for a while that the 0 to 5,000 seat venues seem to have had consistent growth for the last five years. And that's why we were looking to get into the House of Blues and the Fillmore business and the Heineken Music Halls to fill out our portfolio. The 10,000+ shows are the arena/amphitheater shows. Historically, they haven't been growing yearoveryear. But we have such a large market share our goal was really not to grow our market share on the larger shows, it was to buy the better shows and get out of some of the markets and some of the shows that weren't profitable.  Our focus is about buying the right shows for our amphitheaters and arenas, and there's more than enough to fill our pipe. On the smaller 0 to 5,000 it was to increase our market share where there was a high growth potential there and a much lower cost to participate.
Mark Wienkes – Goldman Sachs: And just to confirm, the agreements in place with Nickelback and Shakira are similar to the earlier ones in that all the rights are crosscollateralized; the revenue all goes into one big bucket and then is divvied up at the end?
Michael Rapino: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dingli Chen with Marsico Capital.
Dingli Chen – Marsico Capital: Just talking about the 360 deals that you are signing, did I hear you right or did you basically say that the [EBITDA] you will get from these four deals that you signed it's basically going to equal your entire market cap.
Michael Rapino : The EBITDA will equal the market cap?
Dingli Chen – Marsico Capital: You're talking about the margins and the revenues for calculating the margin percentage off the deal percentage. If this is the total deal, I am getting basically your market capital.
Kathy Willard: Those are the numbers over the term of the agreement.
Operator:  At this time, Mr. Rapino, there are no further questions.
Michael Rapino: Thank you everybody.
Operator: This concludes today’s second quarter 2008 earnings conference call.

Operator:  Welcome everyone to the Live Nation first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions)  Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.  Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures in this call. In accordance with SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation for the most comparable GAAP in the earnings release on their website. The release reconciliation and other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found on LiveNation.com under the About Us section. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Michael Rapino, Chief Executive Officer.
Michael Rapino:  Welcome to our 2008 first quarter conference call. On today's call I'll provide a summary of Live Nation's strategic progress, and then Kathy Willard, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide commentary on our financials. During the first quarter we continued to execute on our strategic plan to maximize our concert platform and fully capitalize on our global leadership position in the live music business. Our mission is to create a company that acquires and distributes live artists' rights with discipline, innovation and accountability while maximizing shareholder value.  Our competitive advantage lies in our global concert platform that spans multiple cities throughout 19 countries, staffed by the most experienced promoters and marketing personnel in the business, selling directly to over 40 million fans, servicing 1,000 artists annually through our 16,000 concerts. Our focus for 2008 is very clear. We are continuing to concentrate on three main priorities - optimization and expansion of our core distribution platform, investing in and developing our online ticketing platform for our 2009 launch, and reducing debt through additional sales of non-core businesses. During the quarter we made great progress and are on plan regarding our ticketing build out. The core operational team is hired and in place. The CTS system is now deployed in our data center and hardware in North America. CTS continues its development work to adapt the system to market, however our team is already building events, selling, printing and scanning tickets. We continue to refine our North American platform by exiting low-growth markets and expanding in the top 20 markets. The agreement to acquire the majority of the live music assets of Fantasma Production, a leading Florida-based promotion company, is part of this growth. The acquisition includes Fantasma's calendar events, two important outdoor midsize music venues, and two outdoor music festivals, significantly strengthening our position in the Florida market, where we historically have been underdeveloped.  Our new House of Blues club in Houston is nearing completion, and construction of our House of Blues in Boston has begun. We expect both clubs to open during the fourth quarter of 2008. North American Music also launched in a European-style three-day festival outside of Vancouver called Pemberton, headlined by Coldplay, Tom Petty and Jay-Z. Initial sales are on route to an anticipated sellout its first year, an incredible achievement by the team.  We increased our International live platform through our agreement to acquire a 65% stake in Dubai-based Mirage Promotions. As well, we acquired the operating company that managed the Heineken Music Hall, Amsterdam's premier music venue, consistently ranked in the top 10 highest-attended music venues in the world, and continued to strengthen our Holland operations, which is our third-largest division in Europe.  Over the longer term, our business model is driven by two levers - the acquisition of artists' rights and the monetization of our distribution platform. During the first quarter we continued to make progress in strengthening these levers. First, our business model is powered by filling our distribution platform with the right talent at the right price. As the largest acquirer of live artists' rights, we have a team of over 400 buyers regionally and centrally that are continually ensuring our distribution pipes are offered at high occupancy. We promote over 16,000 concerts across our platform on an annual basis, spending over $3 billion per year on artists and direct costs related to putting on these events. We acquire these live rights from over 1,000 artists, and we finance these outlays through our working capital. Over the last few years we've been moving to a central buying system for some of these rights on a global and longer-term basis, which has resulted in higher margins and more consistent flow for our pipes and our sponsorship model. Our core strategy for growth is determining how to make our $30 billion in event-related spend over the next 10 years work harder for us. We're doing this by acquiring more rights for a longer time period, with lockedin pricing, cross-collateralized for risk reduction. In 2008, we currently expect to acquire 16,000 local concert rights, over 40 national tour rights, one to three global tours, and to date, three long-term full rights deals with Madonna, U2 and Jay-Z.  The Jay-Z deal demonstrates how acquiring long-term multiple rights for our pipes can produce higher margins than our current local concert model. With Jay-Z, we have acquired the following rights for 10 years, all crossed touring, ticketing, secondary ticketing, merchandise, sponsorship, endorsement, DVD, TV broadcast, VIP, fan club, website, publishing and recordings.  We should generate, based on historic and forward modeling, a minimum of $340 million in revenue over the term and over $38 million in operating income, or an 11% margin versus our current North American 4% margin on single concert rights. We will share in approximately 21% of the total profit versus our current 10% model. We expect to advance Jay-Z approximately $100 million over the term as the rights are performed, which is standard practice.  And we are off to an incredible start with this relationship as Jay-Z is just finishing his North American tour that will gross $36 million, the largest grossing tour of the year and the first hip hop urban artist to sell out the Hollywood Bowl in L.A. and five arenas in New York. And he has just begun the first leg and now headed to Europe for 25 more shows.  The strategy behind the model is simple. We currently spend over $3 billion annually for the lowest-margin right in the value chain, and if we can leverage that $3 billion to acquire higher-margin rights and increase our perartist revenue, then we can incrementally increase our margin and maximize our distribution platform.  The most expensive and lowest-margin artist right is the concert right. Leveraging our concert guarantee to add higher margin rights will produce higher returns for our platform. The incremental cost of acquiring and executing a Tshirt right is minimum, but produces increased margin to our bottom line. The outlook for the remainder of the year in terms of content looks very strong, and we are very confident we have adequate content to drive growth through our platform. A sampling of the North American concerts include the Jonas Brothers, Madonna, today Coldplay announced, Dave Matthews, Pearl Jam, Kenny Chesney and Alan Jackson. On the International side we have a strong lineup that includes Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, Eric Clapton, Robert Plant and Jack Johnson.  Finally, as we have previously stated, we are not seeing nor do we currently expect to see any significant impact on our business stemming from the current economic slowdown.  The second lever that drives our business model is maximizing the 46 million fans that walk through our distribution pipe. The key five levers that drive our profit in this platform are ticket sales, ticket fees, venue ancillary fees, sponsorship, and artist ancillary rights.  In 2008 we will continue to use our growing database and online services to better market our shows and convert marketing dollars from traditional media to online in an effort to reduce overall spend through efficient reach.  We continue to focus on increasing ancillary sales per fan, specifically in regard to food and beverage, through our continued discussions with Aramark as well as other companies regarding our concession contract. We remain confident that we'll replace our current concession contract with one that is more beneficial to Live Nation. Sponsorship continues to be the high-growth potential area, and after signing one blockbuster deal with Citi already, the team currently expects to close over 1,000 deals in 2008. We continue to elevate our average deal size as our proposition to sponsors has evolved over the last two years from a fragmented live on-site proposition to one now that we believe is the most compelling for sponsors looking to reach 46 million avid music fans and 1,000 superstar artists, onsite to online. Increasing our earnings per artist is another way we leverage our relationship with 1,000 artists annually. Live Nation Artists has assembled the world's leading full-service platform for artists, from merchandise and web store management to VIP services and live streaming. Our division houses nine unique services that we currently expect will acquire and execute over 1,000 ancillary rights in 2008, producing what we currently expect to be over $300 million in revenue with great growth potential. This is a new revenue stream we did not participate in three years ago. To conclude, we're off to a solid start in 2008 with regard to the execution of our strategic plan, and we look forward to another successful year for live music. All in all, the live music industry has grown at a healthy 10% compounded annual growth over the last decade and has assumed a pivotal position in the transition of the music industry. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends.  In the year ahead, we believe the benefits of our strategy and investment plan will become increasingly evident as we expand our relationship with artists, fans and sponsors and increase our participation in multiple high-margin revenue products around the live music experience.  And now I'll turn it over to Kathy, who'll comment on our financial results.
Kathy Willard:  In our first quarter earnings release today, we begin presenting adjusted operating income or loss on a consolidated basis and also by segment. Adjusted operating income or loss is a non-GAAP financial measure that the company defines as operating income or loss before depreciation and amortization, loss or gain on sale of operating assets, and noncash compensation expense.  We are reporting adjusted operating income or loss in place of adjusted OIBDAN, which we have used in the past. This change was driven by feedback from investors, and we believe that using adjusted operating income or loss will be a simpler way to communicate our financial progress.  There is no change in the calculation. We are simply changing the term, and this calculation may be similar to how some calculate EBITDA. Moving to our results, during the first quarter consolidated revenue increased $116.2 million, or 22% compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a $15.5 million revenue increase from increased ticket revenues due to strong arena acts and improved results at promoted midsize music venues, as a result of higher attendance, increased show count, and higher average ticket prices for North American Music. Acquisitions accounted for $75.5 million of the increase and included $35.2 million from HOB Canada in North American Music, $16 million from AMG and Heineken Music Hall in International Music, and $24.3 million from Signatures and Anthill in Global Artists.  In addition, we benefited from an increase of $10.8 million related to foreign exchange movement. For the first quarter of 2008, our adjusted operating loss was $2.1 million, an improvement of $0.7 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.8 million during the first quarter of last year. The decrease in adjusted operating loss was primarily driven by a $1.6 million increase in North American Music related to our acquisition of HOB Canada and a $3.9 million increase in International Music related to our acquisition of AMG and Heineken Music Hall. These were partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in costs in Global Artists, which was expected as we continue to invest in our Global Artists infrastructure, and a $3.9 million increase in costs in Global Digital as a result of our efforts to build our ticketing initiative as well as our website and Internet operations. There were no significant changes to our core operations during this seasonally slow quarter. Operating loss increased 4.3% to $38.5 million from an operating loss of $36.9 million in the first quarter of 2007. The increased operating loss was primarily driven by a $7.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to amortization of intangible assets related to the AMG and CBI acquisitions in 2007 and a $1.1 million increase in noncash compensation expense for additional equity grants since March 2007, offset by the previously discussed $0.7 million improvement overall in the adjusted operating income and a $6 million increase in gain on sale of operating assets due to the gain recorded on the sale of a Motor Sports-related joint venture in 2008 as compared to a net loss recorded in 2007 on the sale of two noncore assets.  Turning to some other financial metrics, capital expenditures for the quarter were $23.2 million, which included only $6.3 million of maintenance expenditures and $16.9 million of revenue-generating projects, including the renovation of The Point in Ireland and the AMG venue expansion in Sheffield. We remain focused on controlling maintenance Capex, and currently expect total maintenance capital expenditures for 2008 to be approximately $30 million.  Revenue-generating projects for 2008 will include the completion of The Point in Ireland, our ticketing expansion, the HOB venue expansions in Houston and Boston, and the AMG venue expansions in Brighton, Sheffield and Leeds. We currently expect the total revenue-generating capital expenditures will be approximately $155 million for 2008.  As of March 31, 2008, our reported cash and cash equivalent balance was $434 million and our debt and preferred stock totaled $804 million. We estimate our free cash flow, which is adjusted operating income or loss less net interest expense, cash taxes, maintenance capital expenditures and net distributions or contributions with minority interest partners and nonconsolidated affiliates to be a negative $24 million due mainly to the low adjusted operating income for the first quarter.  We remain focused on the continued execution of our strategic plan and the strengthening of our integrated platform throughout 2008. For the full year, we continue to expect to generate modest growth in adjusted operating income and also expect to invest this growth back into our ticketing, digital ecommerce and Live Nation Artist Initiative. As we previously noted, we expect our ticketing initiative investments to have a $15 million negative impact to 2008 adjusted operating income. Given the progress we have made over the past two years and our current investment plans, we continue to believe that we will be in a position to deliver strong adjusted operating income growth in 2009 and beyond. With that, I will open up to questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs.
Mark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs:  Just wondering, today on Warner Music Group's call they talked about moving away from 360-degree deals. Have you seen that in the marketplace? What are you noticing when you're talking to the artists about these deals? And then also, for Kathy, could you detail the free cash balance for us?
Michael Rapino:  There's a lot of talk on what is a 360 deal. We don't really use that terminology.  We're in a very different business model than the records' 360 model. We business model is because we have the infrastructure, we have a merchandise company, we have a fan club company, we have a ticket company, a sponsorship division, a fan club, a VIP division, our goal is just to acquire all of those rights that we have infrastructure for to maximize our revenues. So as we said, we're going to sign over 1,000 rights this year, whether that's a T-shirt, that fan club rate or a merchandise right. That's our core strategy. Every now and then the Madonna's and the U2's will look to us and say, "We'd like to do all of that, and let's do it for a long-term period." And if the economics work for our pipe, then we'll look at that model. As much press as we've received, all of my intelligence tells me if you added up right now the record labels that I talk to, we have three what you would call 360 deals. I think they have somewhere in the 100 range on 360 deals because they're doing them with every young artist that’s out there. So from what I hear there's more and more attention every day to a longer, deeper relationship with the record label or ourselves, and we have a lot of artists who are asking us daily about is there a new way to be a business partner long term since we're probably going to be their touring partner. 
Kathy Willard: On the free cash calculation which we've used in the past, which is our cash balance less deferred revenue plus prepaids to artists and less tickets sold to others, that balance is about $10 million at the end of the quarter, Mark.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Joyce - Miller Tabak & Co., LLC.
David Joyce - Miller Tabak & Co., LLC:  I was wondering if you could sort of give some color around why the average revenue per attendee was so strong. Is it for a particular kind of venue or just if you could discuss that?
Kathy Willard: And you understand, David, that number is calculated based on total revenue divided by attendees for the quarter?
David Joyce - Miller Tabak & Co., LLC: Yes. Is it the - I was looking for the other disclosure that you had been providing, but I guess it's not there now. Is that going to be in a 10Q on all the events and attendees?
Michael Rapino: Yes. You'll be to divide it out and look on some of the North American show count versus revenue increases.  Our goal in this release, we listened to a lot of investors and a lot of input on how do we get a release with a lot of tentacles to our model? How do we simplify the model, and how do we provide the Street with the key metrics that, if you look at those key eight metrics, if those are going up, our business is doing well and we're on our growth plan. So we tried to distill to a very top line but an important eight lines that says these are the eight things that fill the pipe and the cost to fill the pipe and then the ultimate cost per fan or revenue per fan. And we'll provide you more detail in the summer when we get into a lot more ancillary revenue per fan.
David Joyce - Miller Tabak & Co., LLC: And Kathy, did you mention $150 million of venue expansion expense this year?
Kathy Willard: Yes, that's correct.
David Joyce - Miller Tabak & Co., LLC: And you only did $17 million so far?
Kathy Willard: That's correct. Most of it's going to come in second and third and fourth.
Michael Rapino: Which we've announced the House of Blues Boston, the House of Blues Houston, The Point in Ireland, which will be a fabulous venue.
Kathy Willard: Ticketing and then three AMG venues.
Michael Rapino: Ticketing and three midsize venues in London that are all in varying degrees of progression to come online end of year, beginning of next quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poors.
Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poors:  I guess my first question, I was kind of writing furiously on the Jay-Z deal, Michael, as you were going through some of the details, and just wanted to make sure I understand the numbers.  So when you talk about $340 million, right, is that like kind of the base case scenario? I'm just trying to understand what additional parameters could swing that number one way or the other.
Michael Rapino: When we built our 10-year models for these artists, someone like JayZ or Madonna or U2 have incredible long history, so the historic numbers are fairly easy to dig through to build a forward model. So we use all historic years of everything Jay-Z's ever done historically for years, how many T-shirts, how many concert tickets, how many fan club members, how many sponsorships. We would take all the historic data and then we would apply a discount factor to it for the future, and we would build a model that is a very base case conservative model that we would have presented to your. $340 is a very conservative revenue number that we will absolutely stand behind over the 10-year period. We have absolutely higher expectations as we unlock more and more sponsorship revenue and ticketing online opportunities. But the model right now is just based on a historic performance discounted going forward, so we have a [inaudible] history and said, "Jay's going to sell more records in Year 8 than he sold last year."  And the greatest part about the JayZ model, a lot of people don't understand the power and the iconic state he has become in that genre of music. Our model built his historic touring performance and he just blew by every historic number he's ever done in history on this tour by being the largest single tour he's done in history, the largest arena tour of the year, and he's got a full year ahead of him. And we would assume he has got another 10 years of that and more in terms of his potential and his touring power. 
Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poors: What's the start date actually for this deal? 
Michael Rapino: Well, we closed the deal on last Friday.
Kathy Willard: A week ago.
Michael Rapino: So we closed Friday, but we included all of the tour that started before the closing in this deal. 
Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poors: Okay, so the tour is included? That's what I was getting at.
Michael Rapino: That was the big win on, how do we get these deals so they're accretive day one and cash flowing instantly.
Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poors: Okay, so just still on that theme, would you say, I mean, this is kind of the template that you would use? Because as I look at base side by side with the Madonna deal, there seems to be some differences, a few subtle differences. So I'm just kind of trying to draw comparisons in terms of the potential numbers what this might mean. I know you talked about 11% margin and Jay-Z's deal included entrepreneurial ventures and Madonna's did not, so I am trying to kind of compare what you think are the - which one would you say is the template in terms of your target numbers, what you're trying to accomplish in margin terms and return on investment, etc.
Michael Rapino: We had started the year by saying that we believed that there was a model, and the reason we provided a lot of context today is over the last few months the deals got a lot of press because it's easy for someone to talk about a $100 million JayZ deal. But out of context, we have to step back and go, "That's the business we're in." We advance artists for rights every day of the week. We do it for, we spend over $1.5 billion a year just on artists' rights a year, advancing an artist well in advance of his performance a guaranteed number, and then we recoup that through the performance. So we do this for a living. If we've been advancing Jay-Z over history and certain dates, when we bought a show in Chicago or bought five dates in London, our model is are there opportunities to take that $30 billion we're going to spend in 16,000 rights a year, fragmented pieces, which right now produce a 4% return, if we can model out business cases with artists that we believe have a strong touring future and can feed our distribution pipe and we can put together a 10-year model of touring and then extra rights, the return on capital and margin higher than our current 4%, that's a great model for us. If we could convert a lot of our artists into 11% margin, then we start to answer that question on how do we turn our business from 4% and how do we grow it. So our model is, we said at the beginning of the year we were going to go out with three or four founding artists U2, Madonna, Jay-Z and another one to come in terms of issuing some stock to those artists as an entry point and as a means to get four superstars to really sign up to this model. The good news is we have a lineup of artists that want to be in the top four. We will announce another one fairly soon. We will continue to execute against these four to prove our model out, and we'll continue to evaluate our capital and our working capital guarantee cost basis to figure out are there other artists who want to sign up for long term. Or, sometimes we're not doing a 10-year deal. Sometimes we're just doing an artist - if Justin Timberlake wanted to do a two-cycle tour deal with us and include T-shirts, we would look at that model. That may be better than just buying the local Justin Timberlake date for 4%. So anyway we can use our capital to acquire higher-margin rights, whether it's for a tour, a tour plus T-shirts, two tours, 10 years, six rights, eight rights, we have this incredible advantage that we already buy the lowest-margin right for the most capital. And maybe there's an opportunity to add other rights to that $30 billion we'll spend over the next 10 years and increase our overall margin.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Alan Gold].
[Alan Gold]:  Following up on the Jay-Z contract, Kathy, could you just work through how that would run through the income statement and how the cash would be laid out?
Michael Rapino: No. We're not going to provide that detail today. The cash outlay is a combination of the activity. So we happen to be in cycle right now, so we do have a tour so we've advanced some cash for the tour rights. We have websites going and sponsorship and fan clubs. 
Kathy Willard: And it would go through our prepaids just like they always do on artist advances. And the revenue and operating income that Michael spoke of would be going through our financial statements over the 10year term.
[Alan Gold]: So whatever percent of that - whatever revenue comes in at about an 11% margin would be a good way to look at it right now?
Kathy Willard: Yes.
Michael Rapino: Yes. The revenue's going to come in. Some of it's a tour in North America. Some comes in Signatures, through merchandise. Some come in through Music Today for fan clubs. Some's going to come in our ticketing. But cumulatively, those 10 rights will split out somewhere in the $340 minimum revenue, the EBITDA we gave you, and that margin in our fragmented distribution pipe. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Julie Heckman - Morgan Joseph & Co.
Julie Heckman - Morgan Joseph & Co.:  Okay, first off, can you explain the Citi deal in a little more detail, give a little more color?
Michael Rapino: Sure. As we've kind of put some context around today, we have a very large global sponsorship division that is every day doing local deals. It might be signage in an amphitheater. It might be an on-site display. And historically we have sold a lot of local and regional sponsorship deals mostly based on a venue on-site platform. One of the advantages over the last year is we've moved into having an online platform, having direct access to consumers, having a database, having access to tickets and now access to T-shirts and artists' rights.  Our national sponsorship team has had incredible conversations with a lot of great companies on can they use our tickets, can they use our exclusive T-shirts, our VIP clubs, all of the great content we have to help drive their business model. And Citi would be the first deal where we would say is a demonstration that the sponsorship community is excited about our new platform of concerts, online ticketing and artist rights. And we took our average credit card category, where we've historically been with American Express, and we took that category and doubled it three or four times in terms of annual EBITDA that somebody was willing to pay us for access to our content. So Citi now has an incredible global database. They're helping market our shows and they have access to tickets and various exclusive content over the term to offer to their Citi cardholders. So we are very excited from a multi-marketing perspective, a cash flow perspective, and we think there are more Citibanks that will come to our platform over the next year as kind of our official sponsors.  And Citibank's only a North American deal, so we have a similar situation in Europe on all of our content.
Julie Heckman - Morgan Joseph & Co.: And are there any updates to guidance in 2008? Can you just run through your expectations for the year again?
Michael Rapino: No, we think we did a little bit of soft guidance on the first Q to help out everybody. We gave you a fairly good range on what we believe we will deliver this year from an EBITDA perspective. To date, half of my job is buying the talent. Now the second part is them coming to the shows and buying beers and parking and spending money. So the good news is on a Q1 we can say to you we feel very confident that we have the content to deliver our plan this year. We hope now that it's summer and it's hot and everybody drinks a lot of pop and beer and shows up, and as long as all of those 46 million fans come through the pipes and drink and eat and partake as expected, we believe we are absolutely on plan to the guidance we provided in Q1. By the Q2 we will have a closer idea on where we are. And as any of you have followed, the Q1 and Q2 are really not really relevant to the year. This is a Q3 make or break business where we do a majority of all of our business. So right now we feel great about Q3. We've got the inventory on a global basis, and we have all the levers in place to deliver what we think is a strong year.
Julie Heckman - Morgan Joseph & Co.: Kathy, could you break out the $131 million of [elimination] revenue? I think some of it was feeder, but is there anything else in there?
Kathy Willard: We don't provide that detail specifically, but the main pieces that are included in there are Motor Sports and the U.K. theater business. 
Operator: This does conclude our Q&A session. 
Michael Rapino: Thank you, everyone. Have a good summer.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Rapino, Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Michael Rapino: Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our 2007 year end conference call. On today’s call I will provide you a summary of Live Nation’s strategic and financial progress as well as an overview of what you can expect from us in the year ahead. Kathy Willard, our CFO, will then provide commentary on our financials for the fourth quarter and the full year. First, we are the leader in a growing business and we believe our outlook is outstanding. We are in a strong strategic position to continue to build on our success and capitalize on our vertically integrated platform as we lay the groundwork to take over our ticket in only 10 months. We believe the live music industry is health and expanding with 10% compounded annual growth rates for the last 10 years. There’s no question the live music is the one shining star in the music business as major artists are looking to live music for 50 to 90% of their earning potential. As a global leader in live concerts we are the number one business partner for artists worldwide and we believe we can leverage this position to expand into complementary businesses with the artist. In 2007 we demonstrated tangible results in executing our first two phases of our plan which were aimed at transforming Live Nation into a vertically integrated live music company while improving our financial results and overall operating efficiency. We believe Live Nation today is a significantly stronger organization strategically and financially than just one year ago. Our business strategy is crystal clear to create a vertically integrated distribution platform that capitalizes on the live experience and directly unites artist, fan and sponsor across all revenue generating products from onstage to online spanning tickets, food and beverage, merchandise, fan club, websites, live content, BBB’s, VIP access, sponsorship and many other direct onsite revenue opportunities. Historically we have only had one meaningful participation in the revenue stream and that was at the live event. Our expanded platform changes that by unlocking multiple new revenue streams. Our business model is driven by four core drivers, our global concert platform including tickets and venue revenue, our digital media and e-commerce platform which now has a growing Internet portfolio driven by ticketing, our global artist division which provides artists with integrated programs to build relationships with fans and drive revenue, and our sponsorship division offering sponsors a fully vertically integrated experience from artist to fans.  Let me step back and summarize what we achieved in the past 12 months. First I’m pleased to report that our live music business is strong and our fundamentals continue to improve. In 2007 we served over 45 million music fans, 1,500 artists and more than 15,000 music events across 18 countries. We are the leader in a growing business that now serves the primary revenue driver for major artists. Despite facing tough comparables and a softer concert season in 2007 we achieved overall pro forma adjusted ORDAN of 198 up by almost $80 million versus 2006. This is in large part due to the improvements we made in the core live music business. Specifically we set out to do five things in 2007. First was to continue our asset realization plan to the divestiture of a variety of non-music assets we sharpened our focus on our core music business. Most recently we completed the sale of substantially all of our North American theatrical business and since the beginning of 2006 we have divested assets for total gross sale proceeds in excess of $260 million. At the same time we invested in optimizing our venue portfolio both in North America internationally which we believe will improve our growth profile going forward. Our second priority in 2007 was fixing the core North American music business after five years of decline. We made solid progress in turning around the performance of our amphitheater operations by more effective profit driven booking strategies and cost reductions. We improved our food and beverage per head for the second straight year achieving $12.16 per fan through a focus on improving product quality and whole dollar pricing. These effects have proven successful as our amphitheater pro forma adjusted OIBDAN margins improved by almost 5% in 2007 compared to the prior year. In turn overall pro forma adjusted OIBDAN margin in our North American music business increased 1.2% in 2007, an incredible feat. Our third priority was consolidating our global platform. We achieved notable progress in 2007 with regard to consolidating and building out our global platform and expanding our global touring competency through midsize venue expansion, global platform expansion and touring expansion. Fourth was to solidify a ticketing platform. We took steps to secure control of our ticketing platform. This will allow us to own the customer interface while providing significant revenue growth opportunities especially with regard to sponsorship and e-commerce. And our last priority was to build out our new revenue division, Live Nation Artists, and sign one major artist which we accomplished with Madonna. Now let me turn to 2008 for an outlook. We currently expect 2008 to be another healthy year for the industry. We are not seeing nor do we expect to see any significant impact in our business from the economic slowdown. In the year ahead we are focused on the following priorities, continue to move aggressively to divest non-core assets, continue to increase profitability at our core North American operations, ensure that the build of our ticketing business is complete for launch January 1, 2009, add more artists to our Live Nation Artist roster at all levels from increasing merchandise partnerships to signing fully integrated deals, and finally build and solicit global national sponsors for our new platform. I’ll now take you through our core divisions and give you a summary of the highlights for 2008. Our core business which is the foundation to our business model which provides the 10,000 plus concerts a year and 1,000 artist relationships is the piece of the business that provides incredible barrier to entry and provides the foundation for us to unlock new value. Our North American international business is being our core business we will continue to seek to better monetize our audience by further improving the profitability of our live music operations. Our goal in 2008 is to continue to execute on our amphitheater initiatives and extend them to the rest of our North American operations. This will include a focus on cost reductions on both fixed and variable, driving ancillary revenues mostly through food and beverage and expanding our live platform both through global markets, midsize venues, House of Blues and festivals. With respect to our concession contract a major driver of our North American business we continue to hold discussions with Aramark and other companies and remain confident that we will replace our current contract with one that is more beneficial to Live Nation from both a revenue and margin standpoint. Our new division over the last two years is our ticketing online business. We believe that our ticketing platform will offer a compelling growth opportunity by leveraging our 20 million annual control tickets that our core business generates. We believe that we can unlock value by entering the direct ticketing business at a relatively low entry cost. Combined with our leadership role in live music ticketing is a key component of our integrated platform and our ability to drive higher margin streams. Our collection of websites peak at nearly 12 million unique visitors monthly. We currently service over 400 artist websites. All in all we have built a formidable online presence. However when we add full ticketing function to our online presence principally through LiveNation.com we believe that we will strengthen our growth potential significantly. Through our long term agreement with CTS the second largest ticketing company in the world we will launch our own global ticketing business in 2009. Through this partnership we have secured a technology advance best in class ticketing engine while avoiding heavy capital investments in software. Offering our own ticketing platform will complete our vertical integration from artist to fan and remove the final barrier between Live Nation and the millions of fans we serve. As previously stated we expect that simply taking ticketing in house and recouping 100% of the service charges will improve the profitability of our concert business by generating an incremental $15 million in adjusted OIBDAN in 2009 which will increase to $25 million in 2010. It is important to note that these assumptions do not include any impact from various additional prospects our ticketing business will provide. These added revenue streams will be ancillary product sales, owning the ticket gives us the opportunity to drive ancillary product sales, spanning from fan clubs, DVDs, t-shirts, VIP passes. Our second opportunity of growth through being in the ticketing business will be soliciting third party customers. Our ticketing platform will provide us with the opportunity to pursue ticketing agreements with third party venue. Live Nation has strong relationships with over 650 third party venues that will gradually roll of their existing ticketing contracts. We believe that a value proposition based upon content and ticketing which Live Nation will be equipped to deliver in a leadership position translates into an attractive alternative for our third party venue partners. And the final piece of revenue that will be driven by our ticketing business is in secondary markets we currently do not participate in. We intend to build our presence in the secondary ticketing market and capture incremental revenue through the collection of service fees on secondary tickets which are often sold at a significant premium to face value and dynamic pricing structures aimed at helping sell previously unsold inventory. The overriding principal of revenue that will be driven by our online Internet group is online advertising which we currently do not participate in. By controlling our ticketing inventory it will power our Internet portfolio and provide a platform that opens up new web advertising opportunities. Our third division that has come out of our core business is our Live Nation Artist division. By leveraging our relationships with over 1,000 artists annually generated by our core business we have the relationships base to offer artists more services and products that we now have in house. Through Live Nation Artists we believe we can expand our revenue line and build on the base of over 300 artists that Live Nation Artists currently services. We believe our Live Nation Artist model is the future of the music business. Through internal development and selective acquisitions during the past two years we significantly expanded the number of revenue driving services we can now provide to the artist. In December we purchased Signatures network a global leader in the music merchandise business. Signatures has master licenses with more than 150 artists including many of the top performing artists in the industry today. Through Signatures as well as resources such as Music Today, Anthill Trading and Trunk we now purchase an array of revenue streams built upon the live event and as mentioned before the ticket purchase. These services span artist merchandise, fan clubs, tour websites, VIP tickets, live concert streaming, DVDS among other. They are all valuable components of the artist business model today and into the future. Given the changes that have taken place in the music industry and expanding emphasis on the live event artists are searching for more efficient ways to manage and maximize their diverse rights. Through our Live Nation Artist division we believe that we can deliver an unprecedented package of services built around our gateway to the fan and increasing the sponsor value proposition. That’s why Madonna signed with us, that’s why we expect sign more high profile and proven artists in 2008. We are currently in discussions with several major artists at this time. We offer a partnership based on highly transparent and predictable revenue streams in an industry going through a major transition. Through these diversified rights partnerships we expect to build cross-collateralized opportunities in which both the artist and Live Nation benefit from higher margin revenue streams. And the final division that will drive incremental revenue for us is our sponsorship division. Our triple platform of concerts, tickets and artist rights support another key component of our business and that is sponsorship. By adding ticketing, extending our direct access to fans and broaden our relationship with artists we believe we can better tap into the multi-billion dollar global advertising market. Right now we only drive $100 million in annual revenue from over 500 sponsors. As a whole the advertising industry totals nearly $400 billion with music sponsorship being the industry’s fastest growing segment. We think this represents a fantastic opportunity for Live Nation given the unique value proposition our platform now provides to sponsors. With close relationships with over 1,000 artists, large scale global fan reach and vertical integrated live music laced platform we offer a robust solution to sponsors that is second to none. Going forward the key to our sponsorship strategy will revolve around our ability to develop deeper relationships with artists. We are pursuing dynamic multi-year deals that incorporate multiple aspects of our platform. These multi-product deals on average generate close to three times the revenue as a standard sponsorship agreement. In addition to existing multi-platform deals with [inaudible] Communication, AT&T and Nokia our recently announced deal with Citigroup marks a major step in this business. We are providing Citi customers with multiple avenues to connect with their favorite artists including presales, preferred tickets and exclusive merchandise. In exchange we gain access to a national footprint of over 150 million credit card accounts which we believe will drive incremental ticket sales. To conclude we believe that Live Nation’s integrated business model which unites artist, fan and sponsors around the live music experience is the future of the music industry. As the year unfolds we think that the benefit of Live Nation’s unique business model will become increasingly clear as we build on our leadership position and prepare to take control of our ticketing in 2009. As I mentioned we believe this year ahead will be another healthy period for live concerts and we are well positioned to benefit from that. We currently expect to host tours in 2008 to place Jonas Brothers, Van Halen, JayZee and Mary J., Tom Petty, Tim McGraw, Toby Keith, just to mention a few. We believe we can continue to show improved OIBDAN from our core business as we benefit from additional efficiencies and cost reductions. Throughout the year we will update you on a broad range of initiatives including our progress in signing additional artists to our Live Nation Artist model, building our ticketing e-commerce capabilities and maximizing our asset base and securing additional sponsors. I will now turn it over to Kathy to discuss the financial results.
Kathy Willard: Moving to our results, for the fourth quarter of 2007 our adjusted OIBDAN on an actual basis was $32.6 million an increase of $11.8 million over the same period in the prior year which represents a 3.2% margin. On a pro forma basis which includes all of the acquisitions and divestitures completed through the end of the quarter are adjusted OIBDAN was $34.3 million represented a 3.3% margin. Adjusted OIBDAN increased $5.1 million or 17.2% compared to the same period last year. The increase in pro forma adjusted OIBDAN was primarily due to improved North American music amphitheater operations and cost savings realized from the 2006 House of Blues acquisition, improved results for international music promotions and a reduction in operating expenses due to the conversion of employee bonuses from cash to stock. These improvements were partially offset by the shutdown of The Point in Ireland for expansion and global artist reductions due to reduced touring activity and increased costs to build the Live Nation Artist platform. For the full year our adjusted OIBDAN on an actual basis was $180.9 million an increase of $24.8 million over the same period last year which represents a margin improvement of from 4.2 to 4.3% in 2007. On a pro forma basis our adjusted OIBDAN was $197.7 million an increase of $7.6 million or 4% versus last year’s results of $190.1 million. Our adjusted OIBDAN margin improved to 4.5% on a pro forma basis in 2007 compared to 4.3% in 2006. The increase in pro forma adjusted OIBDAN for the full year was primarily due to improved North American music amphitheater operations and cost savings from the House of Blues acquisition, improved international music promotion and festival operations offset by reduced results in North American music arena and third party events, the shutdown of The Point for expansion and global artist reductions due to reduced touring activity and increased costs to build the Live Nation platform. I’ll now provide you with a quick overview of the main drivers in each of our segments. North American music pro forma adjusted OIBDAN increased $20.6 million for the fourth quarter and $24.3 million or 45.95 for the year. The fourth quarter and full year increases were due to improved amphitheater operations, cost savings realized from the acquisition of House of Blues and bonus payments for employees will be paid in stock instead of cash. These increases were partially offset by reduced arena and third party promotion activity results. International music pro forma adjusted OIBDAN increased 24.7% during the fourth quarter and 7.5% for the full year primarily due to stronger results at several of our festivals in the United Kingdom and improved promotion activity in several European countries partially offset by a reduction due to the shutdown of The Point for expansion. Global artist pro forma adjusted OIBDAN decreased in the fourth quarter and the full year in line with our expectations. This was due to a decline in global touring activity during 2007 along with the investment made in building the Live Nation Artist division during that year. This reduction in touring activity was expected as the 2006 season was a very strong touring period. Global digital pro forma OIBDAN decreased in the fourth quarter and only slightly for the full year as expected due to increased salary, maintenance and consultant expenses related to our internal information technology group and our website management. Turning to some other financial metrics, capital expenditures were $49.4 million for this quarter. Of this amount $14.5 million was associated with maintenance expenditures and the remaining $35.4 million was from revenue generating projects including the renovation of The Point, the purchase of additional land where our Wedding Festival is held and the wiring of our venues. For the full year capital expenditures totaled $116.8 million. Of this amount $45.2 million was associated with maintenance expenditures which was less than the amount spent in the prior two years. As of December 31, 2007 our reported cash balance was $339 million and our debt and preferred stock totaled $863 million. We estimate our free cash balance, that is our total cash after excluding event related cash for future shows, was approximately $85 million. Looking at 2008 we are focused on the continued execution of our strategic plan and the strengthening of our integrated platform. While it is still early overall we currently expect a healthy concert season in line with 2007. For the full year we expect to generate modest growth and adjusted OIBDAN and also expect to invest this growth back into our ticketing, digital e-commerce and Live Nation Artist initiative. As we previously noted we expect our ticketing initiative to have a $15 million negative impact to 2008 adjusted OIBDAN. Given the progress we’ve made over the past two years and our current investment plans we currently believe that we will be in a position to deliver strong OIBDAN growth in 2009 and beyond.  With that I will open it up to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Kestenbaum of Morgan Jason.
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc.: Michael, can you just talk about some speculation in the market about AEG doing a deal possibly to sell 49% of themselves to The Garden and Ticketmaster. How you think that might affect the industry?
Michael Rapino: It was the first question. I guess imitation is the greatest form of flattery. We think it just supports what everything we’ve been saying for the last year that the live music business is just the incredible hot piece of the music business right now. Everybody wants to figure out how to get control of that concert and ticket to build upon their business model. If those rumors are true and there’s investments made into a competitor like AEG I think it, one, it validates the frenzy around the live music business. I think it validates the frenzy that says content plus ticket is the king. And we have great respect for all three of those companies and I’m sure they’ll continue to be a great competitor but we’re very confident that we are ahead of the curve in the industry right now because we’re not talking about change, we have an infrastructure that can execute the new business model today and now it’s about just moving forward and fine tuning the model and finishing the pieces to keep maximizing the revenue.
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc.: My understanding was that you were provide guidance at one point and I guess you kind of gave kind of vague guidance, but as we think about the base on OIBDAN for 2008, should I be thinking well $198 million was your pro forma number and then you subtract out the $15 million for ticket cost and then $11 million I think for the theater sale, so about $172 million is the base as we go into 2008. Is that the way to think about it?
Michael Rapino: Yeah, directionally. I think we believe that first of all we’re very proud of the results we’re reporting today so we think we delivered exactly to the dollar on plan that we delivered to the Board a year ago. So we are absolutely on plan. We’re ecstatic that we grew organically. I mean the North American performance is just outstanding. The margin growth, the organic growth to fix that core business – as I said a year ago if we didn’t fix the core we couldn’t build upon it. So a real testament to the team and Jason Garner who built and rebuilt that division. So we’re very proud that the core is after five years of decline the hockey stick is going in the right direction and we’ve got great growth, great new fundamentals to build upon. So we’re very proud of our foundation and I think we’ve kind of given you guidance that says we will grow the business again organically in 2008 so we’re not asking you to hang tight while we don’t grow it. We’re trying to provide growth but we have said that that growth will also come back and we’ll reinvest that growth back in to cover our ticketing online investment. You know, one growth forward to cover the cost of the investments going forward.
David Kestenbaum – Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc.: And then as far as global artists, you said last year was kind of a light year, 2007. How does 2008 look in that perspective and also when can you expect Madonna to tour? I guess her album is coming out sometime at the beginning of the year and I guess that’s the question.
Michael Rapino: As we said to most investors that asked the question, the core concert business, there’s enough history in our books now and in Pulstar to show you that there is not going to be a sizable change both from a positive or a negative from our core business. We don’t go to sleep worried that we’re not going to deliver 10,000 shows and provide the foundation to our base. But you are right, the difference between a little headwind or tailwind is whether we have three global tours, two or one. As of right now we could say it looks like we have cobbled together one meaning The Police are back out again this year. They won’t tour the entire year like they did in 2007 for a complete comparable but if you kind of added a Van Halen and a Police together right now you could say, okay we are at worst case comparable to 2007. If we get lucky Madonna or some other superstar will wake up over the next few months and decide to tour in the back half. We have not had any confirmation on Madonna’s plans yet. She does have an album out and we, like you, would hope that she decides that 2008 is the year that she’ll tour but no reports from the camp on that yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Wienkes of Goldman Sachs.
Mark Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Just to clarify first on the guidance question, the reinvestment will come in through the op ex line so the reported EBITDA that you’re talking about will be the – like if we used $197 as the appropriate base less the $15, but I thought the $197 was already pro forma for the theater sale?
Kathy Willard: No, the pro forma includes all acquisitions and divestitures through the end of 07 so it does not include the Ovation sale which happened in January 08.
Mark Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: And the on the first growth driver for 2008, can you provide some more specific examples as to how you’re applying the lessons learned from the improvement in the North American amp business to the smaller arenas in 08?
Michael Rapino: Well, they’re not smaller arenas. The second most important piece of our North American business is our arena business.
Mark Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: Smaller venues?
Michael Rapino: Yeah, we kind of consider amphitheaters and arenas the same size in terms of the type of artist that plays them. So in 2007 we focused on the amphitheaters and really booking them more strategically centralizing the booking process, driving food and beverage, driving onsite execution. We do have some great fixed costs and booking strategies that we now know we can implement on how we book those. Remember although the amphitheaters drive an incredible amount of profit they only tend to be somewhere between 900 and 1,000 shows that we do in North America. We then do a few thousand arena shows of the Tom Petty natures, big artists Boston Arena kind of levels. So it’s our second largest EBITDA business is providing all of these great venues around America with 30, 40 shows a year. So we’ll take some of those disciplines and booking strategies and cost reduction strategies and spread those into our arena and what we call club and theater booking. Basically just taking our amphitheater learning and applying it to the entire division in all 10,000 shows and running a tighter ship from top to bottom on how we buy everything not just the 900 shows.
Mark Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: And the promoter compensation is aligned?
Michael Rapino: Yeah, [inaudible] was the big start on getting them aligned. In 2007 we had incredible morale, the momentum was amazing, we had all of our top revenue producers agree to abandon their individual bonuses and align behind the 2007 North American total number and it just amazingly drove the entire organization around one goal of making sure that we hit in North America $74 million which was the magic number that they all worked towards and we achieved it. So now we’ll continue to revise compensation around amps, arenas and total picture.
Mark Wienkes – The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: And then one last one, I promise, could you just provide a range as to how much you think the Citi sponsorship deal could be worth or how much it might matter and then are you going to use this a template for other verticals?
Michael Rapino: The second part is absolutely true. We think it’s a great template that says corporate America is very excited about the music business. Historically because of the closed distribution nature of the industry, whether it was the way records were sold or the way tickets were sold, they had very peripheral participation in the business. They’re very excited about working with companies that open the door and say do you want some tickets, do you some t-shirts, do you want an exclusive single for your business model? And we’re getting great response. We obviously can’t talk about the number on Citigroup I would just say that we had an incredible credit card category takeoff. Everybody was wildly excited to participate. We have great respect for American Express we worked with in the past. We won’t say the size of the number, we could just say to you by having the new platform and selling the music platform versus two years ago we would have walked in and said do you want a motorsport event, do you wan an amphitheater, do you want a theater, all mismatched products that we have taken our credit card category deal and increased it 200 to 300% in terms of our participation.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Blackledge of JP Morgan.
John Blackledge – JP Morgan Securities, Inc.: First on guidance, I know the two previous analysts have hit it, in 08 what will the drivers be and it’s off of $172 just to clarify again, it’s off of $172 and which segments are driving? Are you going to see, I think North American music was much better than we thought in the fourth quarter, you guys did a great job there this year. I know there was obviously a focus for you guys and are we going to see incremental kind of gains again in EBITDA in 08 there and then I have a couple follow ups.
Michael Rapino: I think we’ve got to clarify that $172 that’s escalating away here. They’re already just breaking in the $15 million ticket reduction – 
Kathy Willard: Right. 
Michael Rapino: We kind of look at it slightly the same but a bit different. Take the away the theater business off the core so we get that, our stated goal, it would be fabulously if we can grow the business in some modest low numbers in terms of 8, 9, 10% on a basic base which would try to cover as much as we can of the incremental $15 is the intent for the year. Now we might have a range of if we grow it $10 million or do we grow it $15 million, but our goal would be can we cover the $15 million fixed cost investment in online group through organic growth. And that will the range that we would be participating in this year. Does that help you any?
John Blackledge – JP Morgan Securities, Inc.: Yeah, that’s definitely helpful. On the global artist side, I know you talked about in the press release and in your prepared remarks looking to sign more artists, I’m wondering over the next 12 months how many would you be looking to sign, how many would be of a Madonna type of magnitude from a total dollar amount, upfront payment and length of contract and how many would be smaller type of deals?
Michael Rapino: We don’t have that level of detail for you. Just by virtue of superstarism there’s a few Madonnas in the world period so that pool is fairly small. We’d love to have another superstar of that nature. But we’ve been very clear from day one that that isn’t a quantity division, our portfolio today is one over the next year if it grew to five or six that would be a big target so that’s kind of the range. And Madonna, there’s probably two or three artists that live in the Madonna economic size of deal world and then there are the next superstars who wouldn’t have that level of touring or revenue business, so it would require smaller deals.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from David Joyce of Miller Tabak.
David C. Joyce – Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Couple questions, today Cablevision mentioned that they bought theater in Chicago, is that something you’ve looked at and would you still be interested in adding venues throughout the US or are you more interested in adding venues internationally?
Michael Rapino: Our real focus in the venue would be a House of Blues venues. Those are really the only almost high priority venue that we would own or – and most of the times we don’t own, we don’t want to put the capital to buy real estate in major markets, most major market tenants are wildly excited to give us a long term lease to run a House of Blues in their complex. So House of Blues are a high margin business for us, incredible worldwide brand and we think that is probably the most valuable brand in all live music in a smaller size venue capacity. So House of Blues would be a continued priority, the rest of venues period whether they’re Filmores or midsize, we’re always looking to take over management deal leases in major markets around the world as we did in Holland with the Heineken Music Hall last year which is the premier 5,000 seat venue in Amsterdam an incredible competitive advantage. So we’re not looking to use our capital to buy real estate, our core business is about our scale around our artist portfolio. As I’ve always said there is more artists than there are venues so the artists have incredible power. But where we can find the right venues in the right markets with the right revenue stream return we would always look at a long term management lease if we can bring value to it.
David C. Joyce – Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Another question on the global artist Live Nation Artist division, how should we think about the margins there? Was the investment in the platform to make those services available to artists, is that investment largely behind you now or is there still some more to go?
Michael Rapino: On the infrastructure?
David C. Joyce – Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: Yes.
Michael Rapino: Yeah, we’ve said that don’t believe that there’s always tuck-in acquisitions but we have assembled the execution machine that no one in the world has anywhere close to right now with our music today, our CPITNA touring division, our merchandise division now, our DVD division, our broadcast division and our sponsorship division, we have an incredible service platform in that division that is built out now. Maybe the odd tuck-in, if there was the right company that added some new value but generally our large investments in that division are over. We’ll continue to build the infrastructure and add the experts on the fixed cost side but the real capital that will be used for that is really the artist’s rights advance payments that we put up front when we find the right artists.
David C. Joyce – Miller Tabak + Co., LLC: And finally, you mentioned it looks like the touring level this year would be comparable to last year, I guess that implies you have decent visibility into the summer because wouldn’t one of the recurring concerns here is with the recession in the US and economic growth slowing internationally is there any hesitancy or more immediacy towards the concert date of actual buying the tickets?
Michael Rapino: We’ve analyzed this inside out, we’ve looked just in industry data for 20 years that Pulstar has and you can look at the 93 and the 81 you can look at so called recessions or downturns in the economy in history, doesn’t seem to be any data that would suggest an economic downturn has any effect on the concert revenue business. Internationally or Canadian wise I have had no indications from any of my regional presidents around the world who are selling tickets right now for Jonas Brothers and Tom Petty just went on sale, incredible counts, Van Halen’s on fire, The Police is on fire, Rush, so we haven’t seen anything yet from anybody that would suggest the tickets are showing any reflect on the economy. Now our theory is simple, the average consumer only goes to 1.5 shows a year. We’re not in the quantity business of other consumer categories where you bought eight but maybe you’ll buy six now and we believe that 1.5 show a year is a pretty important fabric to your social scene and that 1.5 times a year you will continue to find the dollars to go and get out and rally behind that band you want to see. We don’t predict in our business model and it would have been an easy one to use right now, but we are very confident that the economic downturn will not be a huge headwind to our revenue this summer.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Shelton of Natixis.
Jeffrey Shelton - Natixis Bleichroeder: A few questions, I was hoping you could expand your comments on M&A to talk about the international markets, that’s the first question. Second question what was the magnitude of the bonus conversions in the fourth quarter and is that type of payment expected to continue into 08 so similarly as it was in 07? I guess you mentioned a $74 million magic number for 07. Do you have one for 08? And last question would be how should be thinking about capital expenditures in 08 if we strip out the incremental $20 million for ticketing, how should we be looking at the trends there?
Michael Rapino: I’ll start and then I’ll pass to Kathy. International markets Alan Ridgeway now back in London, we’re continuing to look as we just announced in this last month our acquisition of a leading international promoter in Dubai. We will continue to look at the international markets, as you know from our numbers international is somewhere in the 7 to 8% margin business, it’s a higher margin business. There are still some incredible good markets around the world from South America to Australia to Germany to Japan and some tuck-in markets in Europe that provide great opportunities. So if we can find the right market with the right partner at the right price we would continue to expand our global platform.
Kathy Willard: As far as the Venice conversion it was approximately $13 million of expense in 2007 that was converted from cash and stocks. As far as 2008 we’re still evaluating and don’t have that number to share with you at this point. On cap ex, you can expect maintenance to be about the same level it was in 07 and the company is still evaluating the revenue generating projects. But if you exclude ticketing based on projects that we have ongoing like The Point and a couple of House of Blues clubs development and a few other projects, it’s not unreasonable that we’ll be about in the same ballpark in total expenditures based on what we see right now.
Michael Rapino: And yes we would continue on the bonus front, we obviously are not going to give you our exact magic number, but yes, every division would have a magic number right now around their driver. And again I just want to reiterate the incredible shift in internal alignment this year is why the machine is starting to work after many years of fragmented agendas. North America we historically had started the year with 50 to 100 different employment contracts from various promoters around the country which were all, when we started the year not one of them was tied to EBITDA, not one of them was tied to $74. We had an incredible team just not pointed in the right direction and we had an annual very large cash expense on bonuses that were kind of guaranteed for showing up well in the excess of $30 million in terms of planning. We started the year and Jason and the team by saying we have to unite as a team around an agenda to be great and we ripped up employment contracts while [interiorily] reassign these contracts through all the leaders wanting to jump on one agenda to win and finally fix North America and we’re ecstatic that we wanted to get our lead promoters invested in our company from a stock perspective, we want them to care about the big picture both from a value perspective and an EBITDA, so we ended up paying out bonuses in stock which is the good part. We now will be able to have some invested employees but the real important part if we aligned them around the target and we dramatically reduced the number we actually paid out from a historical perspective. So that $30 million and plus planning that we would have paid out historically when we aligned them around targets and EBITDA we ended up paying considerably less in our fixed cost reduction plan but more importantly got them aligned around the right agenda. And we will continue to look to get people aligned around our key metrics on EBITDA and OIBDAN growth, corporate EBITDA growth and we’d love to continue to reward them in equity.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tuna Amobi of Standard & Poors.
Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poors: I apologize if you had commented on this earlier because I’m joining a little late, but Michael, the question is for you, I wanted to know what gets you to look at the longer term prospects of the industry, kind of a bigger picture question, where do you see the organic growth coming from? Because clearly I think if you look back over the past few years, I think there’s an argument that there’s been obviously some cyclical peaks and valleys and I thought it was interesting, your comment that data does not suggest that the industry is vulnerable to recession which I, but was somewhat curious, so I guess as you look out over the next five years or so, what is that gets you most excited about the live entertainment industry? Clearly you guys are in a very sweet spot being the largest operator and I see a lot of scale coming from the efficiency gains and cost cutting, but organically is what I’m trying to focus on here and any color that you can provide would be helpful.
Michael Rapino: I will do my best in a short time so we can wrap this up because we have outlined this continually on our core strategy. Organic to start with, we’ve talked about we can run the business better and use our scale in a more efficient manner so we have organically grown North America this year. If you look at Europe over the last three or four years there is lots of organic growth built into that business, whether we launched new festivals, sponsorship, etcetera. The foundation to our business is simple, we have an incredible network around the world of 90+ offices in now 19 countries, 150+ venues, 10,000+ concerts. The great news is if you tried to replicate our network right now it would cost you billions of dollars, if you add up all of the [inaudible] and Clear Channel dollars combined, our platform is incredibly deep, very hard to replicate. Now what we’ve got to do is take that beautiful platform now that the artist is so centered around his live show and what business lines can we enter that are complementary and driven from those 10,000 concerts or 1,000 artists and we believe that the two that we have outlined are the organic growth drivers that will unlock value. You can’t be in the ticketing business like we’re going to be next year if you don’t have 20 million tickets and 10,000 shows. You can’t do it without the scale. You can’t be a destination website if you don’t the scale we have so the great organic unlock that we will do is the idea that we will take our incredible core business 10,000+ shows, 20 million tickets and 1,000 artists and launch a ticketing company that ranks us number two or three in the world overnight added by the fact that we are supplying third party customers with 20, 30, 40, 50 shows a year where we would already be their number one business partner at venues around the world we think we’ve got an incredible opportunity to consolidate the value chain by moving into ticketing, servicing our self and make more money but really unlock new venues and new customers. So every new customer we add to our portfolio next year is incremental revenue at low cost. So that’s the great revenue story for us. We know that that model works, we know that content plus tickets is powerful. We don’t want to be a sports ticketing company. Ticketmaster is an incredible big company, they do a great job but we bring a sweet spot. If you’re a music venue in North America or the world like those 600+ that we are probably already the largest supplier, if you’re a music venue and we’re your best friend because we’re bring you Madonna and U2 concerts, we may be able to be an alternative ticketing option for you also and we don’t need a big market share to make a difference in our business. So that’s where the huge unlock happens next year and I think you’ve seen some market reactions following our strategy as a bit of validation of that. And then the second is just we have 1,000 artists and we didn’t do anything with them. We collected their ticket and sold them a beer for the last 10 years and there’s a sweet spot right now where artists are waking up and their historic business partner, the labels, are having a tough time on refiguring their business model and when you’re spending $1.5 billion a year on artist fees directly to those artists 80 shows a day we settle around the world at midnight in the dressing room we’re writing an artist a check every night. Incredible close relationship with artists. It would only make sense when you’re in that dressing room at midnight after the show that you start talking about why don’t we do your concert t-shirt for you, hey I think we can run your website around your tour better, I think we can drive sponsorship value for you, I think we can get your next single distributed uniquely around the world with a different corporate partner. So if we can capitalize on our 1,000 artist relationship and go build the structure which we did already we’re not asking for anything free. We believe we have the most integrated service platform in the world now. We can gain more revenue by our large concert relationship and we believe that we can enter into the ticketing business and start talking to those 45 million consumers directly and understanding them and selling them and marketing to them which then has that halo effect back in our concert division on how do we market shows, can we be more efficient, do we know them better.
Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poors: Very helpful, thank you very much.
